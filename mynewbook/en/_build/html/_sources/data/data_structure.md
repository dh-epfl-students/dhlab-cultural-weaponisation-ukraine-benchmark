## Structure

This semester project report is divided into three complementary parts:

1. **Weaponized vs. Non-Weaponized Analysis**  
   A global overview of editing patterns across a small and a large database of 2,336 and 19,769 unique users respectively, distinguishing between edits classified as *Weaponized* or *Not Weaponized*.

2. **Weaponizing Users — Fine-Grained Analysis**  
   A focused investigation of 400 unique users from the fine-grained dataset, restricted to edits identified as *Weaponized* by the language model.

3. **Article Analysis**  
   A detailed examination of Wikipedia’s governance, community processes, and policy structures relevant to user behavior and content moderation.
