## Data collection

A former data collection has already been created in Hidi's project, where they built a so called fine grained database with edits already labeled with a specific taxonomy. However, the authors of those edits were unknown and lost in the fine grained step. In order to fill this gap, a match making processus has been conducted to retrieve the user name.
