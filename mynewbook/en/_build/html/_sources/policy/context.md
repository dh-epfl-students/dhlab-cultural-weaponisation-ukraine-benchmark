# Why studying the Wikipedia Policy

At a certain stage of the project, we were realising that weaponization can be way more complex and embeed in the wikipedia policy and structure that it may first appears. Carefully studying Wikipedia’s policies was essential to this project for several reasons : 

* First, it provides a clearer understanding of how Wikipedia functions as a socio-technical system, including its editorial structure, governance mechanisms, and policy development processes.
* Second, it offers insight into user roles, group memberships, and permission hierarchies, helping to contextualise editing behaviour over time.
* Finally, this analysis reveals how both article content and article importance are formally assessed within Wikipedia, and how these classification mechanisms can themselves become targets of manipulation. In particular, the article assessment system gives rise to a distinct form of **structural weaponisation**, in which the textual content of the article is not the primary target, but rather its quality assessment and importance status as perceived by editors and readers.
