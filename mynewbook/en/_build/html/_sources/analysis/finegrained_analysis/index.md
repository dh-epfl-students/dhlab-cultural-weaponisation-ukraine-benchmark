# Weaponizing users — Fine-grained analysis

## Chapter map
- Context and scope
- Taxonomy distribution by user type
- Edit magnitude by taxonomy

## Objectives
- Focus on Weaponized-only subset
- Compare manipulation strategies by user type
- Link taxonomy to measurable edit features

## Data used
- Fine-grained dataset (weaponized-only)
- Taxonomy labels (primary category)

## Analyses included
### Context
- Why restrict to weaponized-only edits
- Relationship to Hidi’s taxonomy

### Taxonomy distribution
- Registered vs IP vs bots
- Normalization choices (counts vs proportions)

### Edit magnitude
- Size distributions
- Differences across taxonomy + user type
- Robustness checks

## Notebooks in this chapter
- {ref}`finegrained_context`
- {ref}`taxonomy_distribution`
- {ref}`edit_magnitude`

## Outputs
- Taxonomy distribution plots
- Edit size comparisons
- Tables for taxonomy summaries
