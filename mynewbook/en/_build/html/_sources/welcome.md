# Welcome

This Jupyter Book supports the research project **Tracking Wikipedia Weaponization and Cultural Heritage Manipulation in the Russo-Ukrainian Context**, originally conducted as a semester project at EPFL’s Digital Humanities Laboratory.

The purpose of this book is twofold.

First, it serves as extended technical documentation of the project. While the original report presents results and interpretations, this book focuses on how those results were produced: data collection strategies, preprocessing pipelines, modeling decisions, analytical trade-offs, and exploratory paths that are often invisible in a final academic paper. It is designed so that a future researcher, student, or collaborator can understand what happens under the hood and can confidently reuse, adapt, or extend the work.

Second, this book functions as a research portfolio. It showcases applied skills at the intersection of digital humanities, data science, computational social science, and security studies. The analyses presented here reflect real-world challenges faced when working with large, messy socio-technical systems such as Wikipedia: incomplete metadata, evolving governance structures, interpretability limits of machine learning models, and the difficulty of transforming abstract concepts like “weaponization” into measurable signals.

## How to use this book 

You are encouraged to read the book non-linearly. Each chapter is designed to be as self-contained as possible, allowing readers to jump directly to sections on data collection, user analysis, network analysis, or policy reconstruction.
