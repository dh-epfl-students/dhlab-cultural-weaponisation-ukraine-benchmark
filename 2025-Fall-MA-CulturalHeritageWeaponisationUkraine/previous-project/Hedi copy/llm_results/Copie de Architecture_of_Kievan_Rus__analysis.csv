"Architecture in [[Kievan Rus]] dates from the its [[Baptism of Kiev|Christianisation]] in [[988]]. The style of architecture developed soon after greatly influenced by [[Byzantine architecture]] with the main architectural works being [[Orthodox Church| Orthodox]] churches. Early churches were mainly made of wood with the simplest form of church becoming known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of what the pagan Slavic temples should have looked like.

The [[Church of the Tithes]] was the first prominent building to be made of stone in the 10th century. The earliest [[Kiev]]an churches were built and decorated with [[fresco]]es and [[mosaic]]s by Byzantine masters. A great example of an early Russo-Byzantine church was the 13-domed [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] (1037-54) but unfortunately much of its exterior has been altered with time. [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (1044-52), on the other hand, is a purely Russian structure. Its austere thick walls, small narrow windows, and helmeted cupolas have much in common with the [[Romanesque architecture]] of Western Europe. Even further departure from Byzantine models is evident in succeeding cathedrals of Novgorod: St Nicholas's (1113), St Anthony's (1117-19), and St George's (1119). 

By the end of the [[12th century]] the centre of political life had moved from Kiev to the northern principality of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]]. The local churches were built of white stone by Romanesque masters of [[Friedrich Barbarossa]], whilst their wall statuary was elaborately carved by craftsmen from [[Georgia (Caucasus)|Georgia]]. These churches mark the highest point of pre-[[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongolian]] Russian architecture. The most important [[Vladimir]] churches are the [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Assumption Cathedral]] (built 1158-60, enlarged 1185-98, frescoes 1408) and St Demetrios' Cathedral (built 1194-97). Another miraculously preserved church is the graceful [[Intercession Church on the Nerl]] (1165), one of the most charming images of medieval Russia. 

Celebrated as these structures are, the contemporaries were even more impressed by churches of Southern Rus, particularly the Svirskaya Church of [[Smolensk ]](1191-94). As southern structures were either ruined or rebuilt, restoration of their original outlook has been a 
source of contention between art historians. The most memorable reconstruction is the Pyatnitskaya Church in [[Chernigov]] (1196-99), by [[Peter Baranovsky]].

The [[Church of the Tithes]] was the first prominent building to be made of stone in the 10th century.

A great example of an early Russo-Byzantine church was the 13-domed [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] (1037-54) but unfortunately much of its exterior has been altered with time. [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (1044-52), on the other hand, is a purely Russian structure. Its austere thick walls, small narrow windows, and helmeted cupolas have much in common with the [[Romanesque architecture]] of Western Europe. Even further departure from Byzantine models is evident in succeeding cathedrals of Novgorod: St Nicholas's (1113), St Anthony's (1117-19), and St George's (1119). 

By the end of the [[12th century]] the centre of political life had moved from Kiev to the northern principality of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]]. The local churches were built of white stone by Romanesque masters of [[Friedrich Barbarossa]], whilst their wall statuary was elaborately carved by craftsmen from [[Georgia (Caucasus)|Georgia]]. These churches mark the highest point of pre-[[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongolian]] Russian architecture. The most important [[Vladimir]] churches are the [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Assumption Cathedral]] (built 1158-60, enlarged 1185-98, frescoes 1408) and St Demetrios' Cathedral (built 1194-97). Another miraculously preserved church is the graceful [[Intercession Church on the Nerl]] (1165), one of the most charming images of medieval Russia. 

Celebrated as these structures are, the contemporaries were even more impressed by churches of Southern Rus, particularly the Svirskaya Church of [[Smolensk ]](1191-94). As southern structures were either ruined or rebuilt, restoration of their original outlook has been a 
source of contention between art historians. The most memorable reconstruction is the Pyatnitskaya Church in [[Chernigov]] (1196-99), by [[Peter Baranovsky]].

 The great churches of Kievan Rus', built after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands. The architectural style of the Kievan state which quickly established itself was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches were mainly made of wood with the simplest form of church becoming known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of what the pagan Slavic temples should have looked like.

**Justification**: The addition of the images, particularly the one highlighting the ""Church of the Intercession on the Nerl"" as a significant Russian medieval church, may subtly reinforce a narrative that emphasizes Russian cultural heritage in the context of Kievan Rus', which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert cultural claims over the shared history of the region.

"Architecture in [[Kievan Rus]] dates from the its [[Baptism of Kiev|Christianisation]] in [[988]]. The style of architecture developed soon after greatly influenced by [[Byzantine architecture]] with the main architectural works being [[Orthodox Church| Orthodox]] churches.

The [[Church of the Tithes]] was the first prominent building to be made of stone in the 10th century. The earliest [[Kiev]]an churches were built and decorated with [[fresco]]es and [[mosaic]]s by Byzantine masters. A great example of an early Russo-Byzantine church was the 13-domed [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] (1037-54) but unfortunately much of its exterior has been altered with time. [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (1044-52), on the other hand, is a purely Russian structure. Its austere thick walls, small narrow windows, and helmeted cupolas have much in common with the [[Romanesque architecture]] of Western Europe. Even further departure from Byzantine models is evident in succeeding cathedrals of Novgorod: St Nicholas's (1113), St Anthony's (1117-19), and St George's (1119). 

By the end of the [[12th century]] the centre of political life had moved from Kiev to the northern principality of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]]. The local churches were built of white stone by Romanesque masters of [[Friedrich Barbarossa]], whilst their wall statuary was elaborately carved by craftsmen from [[Georgia (Caucasus)|Georgia]]. These churches mark the highest point of pre-[[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongolian]] Russian architecture. The most important [[Vladimir]] churches are the [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Assumption Cathedral]] (built 1158-60, enlarged 1185-98, frescoes 1408) and St Demetrios' Cathedral (built 1194-97). Another miraculously preserved church is the graceful [[Intercession Church on the Nerl]] (1165), one of the most charming images of medieval Russia. 

Celebrated as these structures are, the contemporaries were even more impressed by churches of Southern Rus, particularly the Svirskaya Church of [[Smolensk ]](1191-94). As southern structures were either ruined or rebuilt, restoration of their original outlook has been a 
source of contention between art historians. The most memorable reconstruction is the Pyatnitskaya Church in [[Chernigov]] (1196-99), by [[Peter Baranovsky]].

Secular architecture of [[Kievan Rus]] is scarcely known. Up to the 20th century, only the [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)|Golden Gates]] of [[Vladimir]], despite much 18th-century restoration, could be regarded as an authentic monument of pre-Mongolian period.

 The great churches of Kievan Rus', built after the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands. The architectural style of the Kievan state, which quickly established itself, was strongly influenced by [[Byzantine architecture]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches were mainly made of wood with the simplest form of church becoming known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of what the pagan Slavic temples should have looked like. The 10th-century [[Church of the Tithes]] in Kiev was the first cult building to be made of stone. The earliest Kievan churches were built and decorated with [[fresco]]es and [[mosaic]]s by Byzantine masters.
 
-Another great example of an early church of Kievan Rus' was the thirteen-domed [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] (1037–54), built by [[Yaroslav the Wise]]. Much of its exterior has been altered with time, extending over the area and eventually acquiring 25 domes.

 [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (1045–1050), {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} on the other hand, expressed a new style that exerted a strong influence on Russian church architecture.

 By the end of the 12th century, the divide of the country was final and new centers of power took the Kievan style and adopted it to their traditions. In the northern principality of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] the local churches were built of white stone. The Suzdal style is also known as ""white-stone architecture"" (""белокаменное зодчество""). The first white-stone church was the [[St. Boris and Gleb Church]] commissioned by [[Yuri Dolgoruky]], a church-fortress in [[Kideksha]] near Suzdal, at the supposed place of the stay of knyazes Boris and Gleb on their pilgrimage to Kiev. The white-stone churches mark the highest point of pre-[[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongolian]] Rus' architecture.

**Justification**: The revision includes terms like ""Kievan Rus"" and ""Kiev,"" which are historically significant and can be interpreted differently depending on the perspective of the reader.

"Architecture in [[Kievan Rus]] dates from the its [[Baptism of Kiev|Christianisation]] in [[988]]. The style of architecture developed soon after greatly influenced by [[Byzantine architecture]] with the main architectural works being [[Orthodox Church| Orthodox]] churches. Early churches were mainly made of wood with the simplest form of church becoming known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of what the pagan Slavic temples should have looked like. [[Image:Nereditsa.jpg|thumb|The city of [[Novgorod]] and its dependencies boast the largest number of pre-Mongolian churches.]]

The [[Church of the Tithes]] was the first prominent building to be made of stone in the 10th century. The earliest [[Kiev]]an churches were built and decorated with [[fresco]]es and [[mosaic]]s by Byzantine masters. A great example of an early Russo-Byzantine church was the 13-domed [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] (1037-54) but unfortunately much of its exterior has been altered with time. [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (1044-52), on the other hand, is a purely Russian structure. Its austere thick walls, small narrow windows, and helmeted cupolas have much in common with the [[Romanesque architecture]] of Western Europe. Even further departure from Byzantine models is evident in succeeding cathedrals of Novgorod: St Nicholas's (1113), St Anthony's (1117-19), and St George's (1119). 

By the end of the [[12th century]] the centre of political life had moved from Kiev to the northern principality of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]]. The local churches were built of white stone by Romanesque masters of [[Friedrich Barbarossa]], whilst their wall statuary was elaborately carved by craftsmen from [[Georgia (Caucasus)|Georgia]]. These churches mark the highest point of pre-[[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongolian]] Russian architecture. The most important [[Vladimir]] churches are the [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Assumption Cathedral]] (built 1158-60, enlarged 1185-98, frescoes 1408) and St Demetrios' Cathedral (built 1194-97). Another miraculously preserved church is the graceful [[Intercession Church on the Nerl]] (1165), one of the most charming images of medieval Russia. 

Celebrated as these structures are, the contemporaries were even more impressed by churches of Southern Rus, particularly the Svirskaya Church of [[Smolensk ]](1191-94). As southern structures were either ruined or rebuilt, restoration of their original outlook has been a 
source of contention between art historians. The most memorable reconstruction is the Pyatnitskaya Church in [[Chernigov]] (1196-99), by [[Peter Baranovsky]].

Secular architecture of [[Kievan Rus]] is scarcely known. Up to the 20th century, only the [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)|Golden Gates]] of [[Vladimir]], despite much 18th-century restoration, could be regarded as an authentic monument of pre-Mongolian period.
