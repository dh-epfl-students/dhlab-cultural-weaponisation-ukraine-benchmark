==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS.

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

+==Spread of AIDS among children==
+The number of children with AIDS in Ukraine is on rise, since the number of mothers with HIV grows by 20-30% annually. According to the United Nations, the number of pregnant women with HIV was 0.34% in 2007, which was the highest index in Europe. According to the United Nations, of nearly 18,000 children born by HIV-positive mothers in Ukraine, 10,200 children have not contracted HIV and another 5,500 children under eighteen months have yet to receive final results of examination. In Ukraine 1,877 children have been confirmed as HIV positive and 244 have died of AIDS. The United Nations notes that the program of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Ukraine has cut the share of such transmission from 27% of the number of HIV cases in 2000 to 7% in 2006.<ref name=""kids""/>

Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 The number of children with AIDS in Ukraine is on rise, since the number of mothers with HIV grows by 20-30% annually. According to the United Nations, the number of pregnant women with HIV was 0.34% in 2007, which was the highest index in Europe. According to the United Nations, of nearly 18,000 children born by HIV-positive mothers in Ukraine, 10,200 children have not contracted HIV and another 5,500 children under eighteen months have yet to receive final results of examination. In Ukraine 1,877 children have been confirmed as HIV positive and 244 have died of AIDS. The United Nations notes that the program of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Ukraine has cut the share of such transmission from 27% of the number of HIV cases in 2000 to 7% in 2006.<ref name=""kids""/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices.

Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities.

+HIV officially reached the territory of the former Soviet Union in 1987, about 5 years after the virus itself was discovered. Until 1995 there were only a few known cases of HIV infections in the Ukraine. The country was therefore deemed to be “low risk” by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in terms of spreading at that time.<ref name=""Burruano und Seydel"">''L. Burruano und J. Seydel'' Die Ausbreitung von HIV/AIDS in der Ukraine. Gesundheitswesen 2006;68, 8-9, 571-574, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart. ISSN 0941-3790 </ref>

+Between 1987 and 1994, 183 Infections were reported. It can be argued, however, that the beginning of the epidemic took place without being noticed toward the latter end of that period during the social transitional between 1991 and 1995, after the fall of the USSR. The accumulation of cases of AIDS in 2000 supplies evidence for this theory, since HIV has an incubation time of about 7 to 10 years. In addition, an observable increase in the usage of injection drugs started around 1990. In 1990, 22,466 narcotics users were registered by the Ukrainian government. By 1999 the number of cases more than tripled to 74,544 registered narcotics users. Of course, those drug users, threatened by punishment under law, would have done anything to avoid being registered. The Ukrainian Health Department estimates a five to 10 times higher number of unregistered cases. Young injection drug users were the first segment of society, wherein HIV infections spread very fast. The most commonly used drug was, and still is, a cheap hand made Opiate called ‘Shirka’ (in English roughly: ‘jag’).
+Concerning infections of HIV, several factors of the drug-use procedure pose specific threats. It was, and still is, not easy for many to find clean injection needles. Neither are places to replace needles nor are sufficient harm-reduction and treatment programs yet available. Young injection drug users especially have difficulty receiving treatment. Plus it is a widespread tradition in Eastern Europe to share a needle. And the production of the drugs themselves is also not safe. The hand-made drugs are often sold in a syringe already. The containers used for mixing the drugs’ components are shared too. Apparently one method of drug delivery has died out, namely the dissolving of opiates in blood, which would then be sold for direct injection. This was common in the 1990s, and has most likely died out due to AIDS and HIV awareness. Back then, if the producer of the drug was HIV positive, soon were all his customers.
+Because of the size of the HIV epidemic in the Ukraine, it must be assumed that those habits were accompanied by an epidemic of drug addiction. The International HIV/AIDS Alliance has estimated figures claiming that in 2008 between 323,000 and 425,000 people in Ukraine were using injection drugs.<ref name=""Alliance"">''Alliance''.International HIV and AIDS Alliance, Kiew. http://www.aidsalliance.org/sw54545.asp</ref>

 Despite all the here described preventive measures, it is to be taken into account that the main causes of the HIV epidemic in the Ukraine is due to the country’s social crisis. If the consequences of this crisis – like mass poverty and lack of prospect or lack of solidarity – cannot be improved, politics of AIDS will not be successful either.

+A great influence in containing an epidemic is the availability of harm-reduction-programs. Programs for handing out sterilized needles are of greatest importance. The impact of those programs will be minor however, as long as the usage of drugs is a crime.
+The success of drug substitution programs finds its base in the ability to give drug addicts the chance to escape withdrawal symptoms and participate in social life with the usage of legal and clean injections. Therefore, the vicious circle of drug usage, drug-related crimes, precarious social status and the need to temporarily escape the latter can be broken.
+
+Drug substitution programs require a stable society, which is capable and willing to integrate drug addicts and offering them an alternative to the lack of perspective, which led them to drugs. Since those factors are not given in contemporary Ukraine, the introduction of drug substation programs is doubtful. Particularly, this is because it is unclear if governmental control mechanisms suffice to prevent substitution drugs from being dealt illegally.
+Since 2003, drug substitution programs have been introduced to Ukraine. By the end of September 2008 they were offered to about 2200 persons in 38 locations.<ref name=""Alliance"" /> Mostly Buprenorphin (Trademark ‘Subutex®‘) is dispensed, which is significantly more expensive than Methadon. It is also less frequently used and thoroughly researched worldwide. Buprenophin is more accepted by society and politicians however, because it is seen as a painkiller. Methadon, in contrast, is viewed as a drug on public expense.<ref name=""Weber"">''C. Weber'' Assessment 2007 in Donetsk. http://www.aids-ukraine.org.</ref>

Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 The reason why prostitution is on the rise in Ukraine is because of the poverty of these women and the increasing demand. In the last years there was an observable rise in sex tourism in this country. Consequently, sexual exploit and human trafficking are increasing, too. Some polls among prostitutes demonstrate that they do not use condoms regularly. In a 2007 survey only 48 percent claimed to always insist on safer sex. This survey was addressed to women who already had been in touch with an educational advertising program. (This is how the people conducting the survey could contact them.) An improvement of the situation of the prostitutes could be achieved because prostitution is no longer chargeable in Ukraine since 2006. Hopefully this will help to encourage prostitutes to frequent doctors or consult prevention contact points. 
 The transmission of the HI virus among homosexuals and bisexuals does not play as an outstanding role in Ukraine as it does in Western Europe or North America.  From 1987 to 2007 157 cases have officially been registered, one third of them in 2007 (48 new infections). As a matter of fact it can be assumed that along with the increase of sexual transmission in general, the number of infections among homosexuals is rising as well. It is difficult to assess this circumstance as many homosexuals who have proved to be HIV positive prefer to claim a different way of transmission. From 1991 on homosexuality is no longer chargeable, but is still treated in a discriminating way. Consequently, this group of people is also very difficult to reach via educational advertising. According to surveys carried out by the Global Fund only 5 percent of them are estimated to be reached.

 A very high percentage of the prisoners are drug addicts. Two laws contribute to that. First, one can be prosecuted to three and more years of detention for the least amount of illegal drugs. Second, the [[Militsiya|militia]] is still measured according to their output target, i.e. the number of convicted crimes. It is not exception but rule that the target is fulfilled with drug addicts who are easy to find. Like everywhere in the world, the drug use is higher in prisons than outside, whereas injections are even scarcer. Altogether, bad hygienic conditions prevail in the prisons. Another problem is the violence among the detainees. A major [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission route]] for HIV is [[rape]]. Moreover, until today in Ukrainian prisons have been no broader preventive measures which would allow the detainees the access to preventive aids. At the moment are approximately 150.000 people detained in Ukraine, before the assumption of office by President [[Yushchenko]], after the [[Orange Revolution]], there were even more.

+=== Transmission through sexual intercourse ===

+The spread of HIV through sexual intercourse is steadily increasing. Of those 122.674 people who have been recorded HIV positive in Ukraine in 2007 40 percent have been infected by injecting drugs and 38 percent during sexual intercourse. Although experts are still speaking about an epidemic, which mainly concerns the risk groups, the increasing HIV infections because of sex indicate that it is only a matter of time until the epidemic hits the common population. The most important cut surface of drug milieu and the rest of society is the sector of prostitution. This is how many women who are addicted to drugs or live together with drug addicted men try to make a living and pay for their drugs consumption. The transmission in the prostitution sector is not officially recorded in Ukraine. First surveys, however, show an immensely increasing spread.
+The reason why prostitution is on the rise in Ukraine is because of the poverty of these women and the increasing demand. In the last years there was an observable rise in sex tourism in this country. Consequently, sexual exploit and human trafficking are increasing, too. Some polls among prostitutes demonstrate that they do not use condoms regularly. In a 2007 survey only 48 percent claimed to always insist on safer sex. This survey was addressed to women who already had been in touch with an educational advertising program. (This is how the people conducting the survey could contact them.)

It is difficult to assess this circumstance as many homosexuals who have proved to be HIV positive prefer to claim a different way of transmission. From 1991 on homosexuality is no longer chargeable, but is still treated in a discriminating way. Consequently, this group of people is also very difficult to reach via educational advertising.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

-==Spread of AIDS among children==
+=== Geschichte ===
+
+=== Causes and Extent of the Drug Epidemic ===
+
+The main cause for the [[epidemic]] spread of [[drug abuse]] was the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. Many companies had to be closed. The mass unemployment led to poverty and lack of prospects for the future. On the other hand, during and immediately after the independence of Ukraine there was a phase of low statehood. Lawless areas emerged and especially young people lacked orientation. Due to the fact that the [[Ideology of Soviet Communism|Soviet ideology]] had also been a substitute for religion, the system of values was deteriorated along with the old state. 
+
+Exceedingly affected regions were those which had been during the Soviet period the most industrialised in the country, hence the experience of the most sudden downfall, due to the industry’s collapse. 
+
+The effortless availability of drugs in the Ukraine and the explosive increase of the drug market facilitated the necessity for drugs. This is presumably the reason for the faster and wider spread of drug abuse, and in its consequence the [[HIV]] epidemic, than in other former Soviet republics. Factors, why there have been not only huge amounts of drugs, but also various kinds of drugs are: 1. The Ukraine has been a transit country for [[Opium]] transport from the [[Middle East]] to Europe. 2. The soil is of good quality, thus opium poppies flourish within the country very well. 3. Some Ukrainian cities are traditional locations of the chemical industry. On the other hand, the state lacks control of the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. 
+
+Therefore, it was possible that the [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] [[Tramadol]] after its approval in 2004 has become one of the most popular gateway drug within few months due to the [[black market]]. 
+
+The [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] was the prerequisite and the cause for the outbreak of the HIV epidemic in the Ukraine. Other reasons can be found in the Soviet and Russian past, respectively. The production and (especially collective) use of ordinary opiates like ''Kompott'' and ''Schirka'' or [[ephedrine]] [[derivatives]] like ''Wind'' has already been common in the Soviet Union. Those drugs have become fashionable since the 1990ies, stimulated by the home coming [[Afghanistan]] veterans of whom many had got used to opium consumption over there. Despite the experienced defeat, in the most adolescent’s eyes the soldiers glowed with freedom and adventure, so that many imitated them. 
+
+The fast spread drug use among adolescents is to be seen in context to the far older, from the Russian tradition originating, mass [[alcoholism]]. Still today is alcoholism one of the largest health risks especially for men in the former Soviet Union.[5] Adolescents, whose parents drink, tend particularly to using drugs.[6] 
+
+Further important factors for the spread of HIV in the Ukraine are the prisons and [[penal colonies]].
+
+=== Prisons ===
+
+A very high percentage of the prisoners are drug addicts. Two laws contribute to that. First, one can be prosecuted to three and more years of detention for the least amount of illegal drugs. Second, the [[Militsiya|militia]] is still measured according to their output target, i.e. the number of convicted crimes. It is not exception but rule that the target is fulfilled with drug addicts who are easy to find. Like everywhere in the world, the drug use is higher in prisons than outside, whereas injections are even scarcer. Altogether, bad hygienic conditions prevail in the prisons. Another problem is the violence among the detainees. A major [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission route]] for HIV is [[rape]]. Moreover, until today in Ukrainian prisons have been no broader preventive measures which would allow the detainees the access to preventive aids. At the moment are approximately 150.000 people detained in Ukraine, before the assumption of office by President [[Yushchenko]], after the [[Orange Revolution]], there were even more.

 [[File:Number of HIV infected women and childeren.jpg|thumb|200px|Number of HIV infected women and children (late 2007)]]
 The number of children with AIDS in Ukraine is on rise, since the number of mothers with HIV grows by 20-30% annually. According to the United Nations, the number of pregnant women with HIV was 0.34% in 2007, which was the highest index in Europe. According to the United Nations, of nearly 18,000 children born by HIV-positive mothers in Ukraine, 10,200 children have not contracted HIV and another 5,500 children under eighteen months have yet to receive final results of examination. In Ukraine 1,877 children have been confirmed as HIV positive and 244 have died of AIDS. The United Nations notes that the program of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Ukraine has cut the share of such transmission from 27% of the number of HIV cases in 2000 to 7% in 2006.<ref name=""kids""/>

+
+== Preventive Measures ==
+
+Despite all the here described preventive measures, it is to be taken into account that the main causes of the HIV epidemic in the Ukraine is due to the country’s social crisis. If the consequences of this crisis – like mass poverty and lack of prospect or lack of solidarity – cannot be improved, politics of AIDS will not be successful either.

-Between 1987 and 1994, 183 Infections were reported.

The accumulation of cases of AIDS in 2000 supplies evidence for this theory, since HIV has an incubation time of about 7 to 10 years. In addition, an observable increase in the usage of injection drugs started around 1990. In 1990, 22,466 narcotics users were registered by the Ukrainian government. By 1999 the number of cases more than tripled to 74,544 registered narcotics users. Of course, those drug users, threatened by punishment under law, would have done anything to avoid being registered. The Ukrainian Health Department estimates a five to 10 times higher number of unregistered cases. Young injection drug users were the first segment of society, wherein HIV infections spread very fast. The most commonly used drug was, and still is, a cheap hand made Opiate called ‘Shirka’ (in English roughly: ‘jag’).
-Concerning infections of HIV, several factors of the drug-use procedure pose specific threats. It was, and still is, not easy for many to find clean injection needles. Neither are places to replace needles nor are sufficient harm-reduction and treatment programs yet available. Young injection drug users especially have difficulty receiving treatment. Plus it is a widespread tradition in Eastern Europe to share a needle. And the production of the drugs themselves is also not safe. The hand-made drugs are often sold in a syringe already. The containers used for mixing the drugs’ components are shared too. Apparently one method of drug delivery has died out, namely the dissolving of opiates in blood, which would then be sold for direct injection.

 Because of the size of the HIV epidemic in the Ukraine, it must be assumed that those habits were accompanied by an epidemic of drug addiction. The International HIV/AIDS Alliance has estimated figures claiming that in 2008 between 323,000 and 425,000 people in Ukraine were using injection drugs.<ref name=""Alliance"">''Alliance''.International HIV and AIDS Alliance, Kiew. http://www.aidsalliance.org/sw54545.asp</ref>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 === Harm Reduction programs ===
 
 A great influence in containing an epidemic is the availability of harm-reduction-programs. Programs for handing out sterilized needles are of greatest importance. The impact of those programs will be minor however, as long as the usage of drugs is a crime.
-The success of drug substitution programs finds its base in the ability to give drug addicts the chance to escape withdrawal symptoms and participate in social life with the usage of legal and clean injections. Therefore, the vicious circle of drug usage, drug-related crimes, precarious social status and the need to temporarily escape the latter can be broken.

-Drug substitution programs require a stable society, which is capable and willing to integrate drug addicts and offering them an alternative to the lack of perspective, which led them to drugs.

UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue.

 === History ===
 
-HIV officially reached the territory of the former Soviet Union in 1987, about 5 years after the virus itself was discovered. Until 1995 there were only a few known cases of HIV infections in the Ukraine. The country was therefore deemed to be “low risk” by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in terms of spread at that time.<ref name=""Burruano und Seydel"">''L. Burruano und J.

 Between 1987 and 1994, 183 infections were reported. It can be argued, however, that the beginning of the epidemic took place unnoticed toward the latter end of the social transitional between 1991 and 1995, after the fall of the USSR. The accumulation of cases of AIDS in 2000 supplies evidence for this theory, since HIV has an incubation time of about 7 to 10 years. In addition, an observable increase in the usage of injection drugs started around 1990. In 1990, 22,466 narcotics users were registered by the Ukrainian government. By 1999 the number of cases had more than tripled to 74,544 registered narcotics users. Of course, those drug users, threatened by punishment under law, would have done anything to avoid being registered. The Ukrainian Health Department estimates a five to 10 times higher number of unregistered cases. Young injection drug users made up the first segment of society, wherein HIV infections spread very fast. The most commonly used drug was, and still is, a cheap hand made opiate called ‘Shirka’ or ""khanka"", English rendering may be roughly ‘jag’or 'smack' manufactured from the widely grown poppies in the countrysides.
 Concerning infections of HIV, several factors of the drug-use procedure pose specific threats. It was, and still is, not easy for many to find clean injection needles. Neither places to replace needles nor sufficient harm-reduction and treatment programs are available yet. Young injection drug users especially have difficulty receiving treatment. Plus it is a widespread tradition in Eastern Europe to share a needle due to the shortage of the disposable syringes and needles. And the production of the drugs themselves is also not safe. The hand-made drugs may often be sold in a syringe already. The containers used for mixing the drug components are shared too. Apparently one method of drug delivery has died out, namely the dissolving of opiates in blood, which would then be sold for direct injection. This was common in the 1990s, and has most likely died out due to AIDS and HIV awareness. Back then, if the producer of the drug was HIV positive, soon were all his customers.",improving diction,Fartherred,2010-05-21T04:07:34Z,"Changed ""the Ukraine"" to ""Ukraine"".

 For these reasons, it was possible that the [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] [[Tramadol]], after its approval in 2004, becomes one of the most popular gateway drugs within a few months due on the [[black market]]. 
 
-The [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] was the prerequisite and the cause for the outbreak of the HIV epidemic in the Ukraine. Other reasons can be found in the Soviet and Russian past, respectively. The production and (especially collective) use of ordinary opiates like ''kompott'', ""mastyrka"" and ''schirka'' or [[ephedrine]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] like ''wind'' was already common in the Soviet Union. Those drugs have become fashionable since the 1990s, stimulated by the home coming [[Afghanistan]] veterans  many of whom had got used to opium consumption over there. Despite the defeat, in the most adolescents' eyes the soldiers glowed with freedom and adventure, so that many imitated them.

 The fast spread of drug use among adolescents is to be seen in the context of the far older population [alcoholism]], originating in the Russian tradition. Still today alcoholism is one of the largest health risks, especially for men in the former Soviet Union.[5] Adolescents whose parents drink tend particularly to use drugs.[6]

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations.

 The success of drug substitution programs lies in the ability to give drug addicts the chance to escape withdrawal symptoms and participate in social life with the use of legal and clean injections. Therefore, the vicious circle of drug use, drug-related crimes, precarious social status and the need to temporarily escape the latter can be broken.
 
 Drug substitution programs require a stable society, which is capable and willing to integrate drug addicts and offers them an alternative to the lack of perspective that led them to drugs. Since those factors are not given in contemporary Ukraine, the introduction of drug substitution programs is doubtful. This particularly, because it is unclear if governmental control mechanisms suffice to prevent substitution drugs from being dealt illegally.

First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 === Causes and Extent of the Drug Epidemic ===
 
-The main cause for the [[epidemic]] spread of [[drug abuse]] was the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. Many companies had to be closed. The mass unemployment led to poverty and lack of prospects for the future. On the other hand, during and immediately after the independence of Ukraine there was a phase of low statehood. Lawless areas emerged and especially young people lacked orientation. Due to the fact that the [[Ideology of Soviet Communism|Soviet ideology]] had also been a substitute for religion, the system of values was deteriorated along with the old state.

-The effortless availability of drugs in the Ukraine and the explosive increase of the drug market facilitated the necessity for drugs. This is presumably the reason for the faster and wider spread of drug abuse, and in its consequence the [[HIV]] epidemic, than in other former Soviet republics. Factors, why there have been not only huge amounts of drugs, but also various kinds of drugs are: 1. The Ukraine has been a transit country for [[Opium]] transport from the [[Middle East]] to Europe. 2. The soil is of good quality, thus opium poppies flourish within the country very well. 3. Some Ukrainian cities are traditional locations of the chemical industry. On the other hand, the state lacks control of the [[pharmaceutical industry]].

-The [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] was the prerequisite and the cause for the outbreak of the HIV epidemic in the Ukraine. Other reasons can be found in the Soviet and Russian past, respectively. The production and (especially collective) use of ordinary opiates like ''Kompott'' and ''Schirka'' or [[ephedrine]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] like ''Wind'' has already been common in the Soviet Union. Those drugs have become fashionable since the 1990ies, stimulated by the home coming [[Afghanistan]] veterans of whom many had got used to opium consumption over there. Despite the experienced defeat, in the most adolescent’s eyes the soldiers glowed with freedom and adventure, so that many imitated them.

-The fast spread drug use among adolescents is to be seen in context to the far older, from the Russian tradition originating, mass [[alcoholism]].

 Further important factors for the spread of HIV in the Ukraine are the prisons and [[penal colonies]].
 
 === Prisons ===
 
-A very high percentage of the prisoners are drug addicts. Two laws contribute to that. First, one can be prosecuted to three and more years of detention for the least amount of illegal drugs. Second, the [[Militsiya|militia]] is still measured according to their output target, i.e. the number of convicted crimes. It is not exception but rule that the target is fulfilled with drug addicts who are easy to find. Like everywhere in the world, the drug use is higher in prisons than outside, whereas injections are even scarcer. Altogether, bad hygienic conditions prevail in the prisons. Another problem is the violence among the detainees. A major [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission route]] for HIV is [[rape]]. Moreover, until today in Ukrainian prisons have been no broader preventive measures which would allow the detainees the access to preventive aids. At the moment are approximately 150.000 people detained in Ukraine, before the assumption of office by President [[Yushchenko]], after the [[Orange Revolution]], there were even more.

 Badly affected regions were those that had been the most industrialised in the country during the Soviet period, which now experienced a sudden downfall due to the collapse of the industry.

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS.

In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs.

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 === Transmission through sexual intercourse ===
 
-The spread of HIV through sexual intercourse is steadily increasing. Of those 122.674 people who have been recorded HIV positive in Ukraine in 2007 40 percent have been infected by injecting drugs and 38 percent during sexual intercourse. Although experts are still speaking about an epidemic, which mainly concerns the risk groups, the increasing HIV infections because of sex indicate that it is only a matter of time until the epidemic hits the common population. The most important cut surface of drug milieu and the rest of society is the sector of prostitution. This is how many women who are addicted to drugs or live together with drug addicted men try to make a living and pay for their drugs consumption. The transmission in the prostitution sector is not officially recorded in Ukraine. First surveys, however, show an immensely increasing spread.
-The reason why prostitution is on the rise in Ukraine is because of the poverty of these women and the increasing demand. In the last years there was an observable rise in sex tourism in this country. Consequently, sexual exploit and human trafficking are increasing, too. Some polls among prostitutes demonstrate that they do not use condoms regularly. In a 2007 survey only 48 percent claimed to always insist on safer sex. This survey was addressed to women who already had been in touch with an educational advertising program. (This is how the people conducting the survey could contact them.) An improvement of the situation of the prostitutes could be achieved because prostitution is no longer chargeable in Ukraine since 2006. Hopefully this will help to encourage prostitutes to frequent doctors or consult prevention contact points. 
-The transmission of the HI virus among homosexuals and bisexuals does not play as an outstanding role in Ukraine as it does in Western Europe or North America.  From 1987 to 2007 157 cases have officially been registered, one third of them in 2007 (48 new infections). As a matter of fact it can be assumed that along with the increase of sexual transmission in general, the number of infections among homosexuals is rising as well. It is difficult to assess this circumstance as many homosexuals who have proved to be HIV positive prefer to claim a different way of transmission. From 1991 on homosexuality is no longer chargeable, but is still treated in a discriminating way. Consequently, this group of people is also very difficult to reach via educational advertising. According to surveys carried out by the Global Fund only 5 percent of them are estimated to be reached.

 === Harm Reduction programs ===
 
 A great influence in containing an epidemic is the availability of harm-reduction-programs. Programs for handing out sterilized needles are of greatest importance. The impact of those programs will be minor however, as long as the usage of drugs is a crime.
-The success of drug substitution programs lies in the ability to give drug addicts the chance to escape withdrawal symptoms and participate in social life with the use of legal and clean injections. Therefore, the vicious circle of drug use, drug-related crimes, precarious social status and the need to temporarily escape the latter can be broken.

 Drug substitution programs require a stable society, which is capable and willing to integrate drug addicts and offers them an alternative to the lack of perspective that led them to drugs. Since those factors are not given in contemporary Ukraine, the introduction of drug substitution programs is doubtful. This particularly, because it is unclear if governmental control mechanisms suffice to prevent substitution drugs from being dealt illegally.
 Since 2003, drug substitution programs have been introduced in Ukraine. By the end of September 2008 they were offered to about 2200 persons in 38 locations.<ref name=""Alliance"" /> Mostly Buprenorphin (Trademark ‘Subutex‘) is dispensed, which is significantly more expensive than Methadon. It is also less frequently used and thoroughly researched worldwide. Buprenophin is more accepted by society and politicians however, because it is seen as a painkiller.

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS.

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world.

 === Transmission through sexual intercourse ===
 
 The spread of HIV through sexual intercourse is steadily increasing. Of those 122,674 people who have been registered HIV positive in Ukraine in 2007, 40 percent have been infected by injecting drugs and 38 percent due to sexual intercourse. Although experts still speak about an epidemic, which mainly concerns the risk groups, the increasing HIV infections because of sex indicate that it is only a matter of time before the epidemic hits the common population. The most important interface between the drug milieu and the rest of society is the sector of prostitution. This is how many women who are addicted to drugs or live together with drug - addicted men try to make a living and pay for their drug consumption. Transmission in the prostitution sector is not officially registered in Ukraine. First surveys, however, show a huge increase in numbers.
-The reason why prostitution is on the rise in Ukraine is because of the poverty of these women and the increasing demand. In the last years there was an observable rise in sex tourism in this country. Consequently, sexual activities and human trafficking are increasing, too. Some polls among prostitutes show that they do not use condoms regularly. In a 2007 survey, only 48 percent claimed to always insist on safer sex. This survey was addressed to women who had already been in touch with an educational advertising program. (This is why the people conducting the survey could contact them.) An improvement in the situation of prostitutes could be achieved because prostitution was made legal in Ukraine in 2006. Hopefully this will help to encourage prostitutes to seek out doctors or consult prevention contact points. 
-The transmission of HIV among homosexuals and bisexuals does not play as great a role in Ukraine as it does in Western Europe or North America.  From 1987 to 2007, 157 cases have been officially recorded, one third of them in 2007 (48 new infections). Indeed it can be assumed that along with the increase in sexual transmission in general, the number of infections among homosexuals is rising as well. It is difficult to assess this circumstance as many homosexuals who have proved to be HIV positive prefer to claim a different path of transmission. From 1991 on, homosexuality has no longer been an offence, but homosexuals are still discriminated against. Consequently, this group of people is also very difficult to reach via educational advertising. According to surveys carried out by the Global Fund only 5 percent of them can be reached.

 === History ===
 
-HIV officially reached the territory of the former Soviet Union in 1987, about 5 years after the virus itself was discovered. Until 1995 there were only a few known cases of HIV infections in Ukraine. The country was therefore deemed to be “low risk” by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in terms of spread at that time.<ref name=""Burruano und Seydel"">''L. Burruano und J.

 Between 1987 and 1994, 183 infections were reported. It can be argued, however, that the beginning of the epidemic took place unnoticed toward the latter end of the social transitional between 1991 and 1995, after the fall of the USSR. The accumulation of cases of AIDS in 2000 supplies evidence for this theory, since HIV has an incubation time of about 7 to 10 years. In addition, an observable increase in the usage of injection drugs started around 1990. In 1990, 22,466 narcotics users were registered by the Ukrainian government. By 1999 the number of cases had more than tripled to 74,544 registered narcotics users. Of course, those drug users, threatened by punishment under law, would have done anything to avoid being registered. The Ukrainian Health Department estimates a five to 10 times higher number of unregistered cases. Young injection drug users made up the first segment of society, wherein HIV infections spread very fast. The most commonly used drug was, and still is, a cheap hand made opiate called ‘Shirka’ or ""khanka"", English rendering may be roughly ‘jag’or 'smack' manufactured from the widely grown poppies in the countrysides.
 Concerning infections of HIV, several factors of the drug-use procedure pose specific threats. It was, and still is, not easy for many to find clean injection needles. Neither places to replace needles nor sufficient harm-reduction and treatment programs are available yet. Young injection drug users especially have difficulty receiving treatment. Plus it is a widespread tradition in Eastern Europe to share a needle due to the shortage of the disposable syringes and needles. And the production of the drugs themselves is also not safe. The hand-made drugs may often be sold in a syringe already. The containers used for mixing the drug components are shared too. Apparently one method of drug delivery has died out, namely the dissolving of opiates in blood, which would then be sold for direct injection. This was common in the 1990s, and has most likely died out due to AIDS and HIV awareness. Back then, if the producer of the drug was HIV positive, soon were all his customers.

 The [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] was the prerequisite and the cause for the outbreak of the HIV epidemic in Ukraine. Other reasons can be found in the Soviet and Russian past, respectively. The production and (especially collective) use of ordinary opiates like ''kompott'', ""mastyrka"" and ''schirka'' or [[ephedrine]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] like ''wind'' was already common in the Soviet Union. Those drugs have become fashionable since the 1990s, stimulated by the home coming [[Afghanistan]] veterans  many of whom had got used to opium consumption over there.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] was the prerequisite and the cause for the outbreak of the HIV epidemic in Ukraine. Other reasons can be found in the Soviet and Russian past, respectively.

 Between 1987 and 1994, 183 infections were reported. It can be argued, however, that the beginning of the epidemic took place unnoticed toward the latter end of the social transitional between 1991 and 1995, after the fall of the USSR. The accumulation of cases of AIDS in 2000 supplies evidence for this theory, since HIV has an incubation time of about 7 to 10 years. In addition, an observable increase in the usage of injection drugs started around 1990. In 1990, 22,466 narcotics users were registered by the Ukrainian government. By 1999 the number of cases had more than tripled to 74,544 registered narcotics users. Of course, those drug users, threatened by punishment under law, would have done anything to avoid being registered. The Ukrainian Health Department estimates a five to 10 times higher number of unregistered cases. Young injection drug users made up the first segment of society, wherein HIV infections spread very fast. The most commonly used drug was, and still is, a cheap hand made opiate called ‘Shirka’ or ""khanka"", English rendering may be roughly ‘jag’or 'smack' manufactured from the widely grown poppies in the countrysides.
 Concerning infections of HIV, several factors of the drug-use procedure pose specific threats. It was, and still is, not easy for many to find clean injection needles. Neither places to replace needles nor sufficient harm-reduction and treatment programs are available yet. Young injection drug users especially have difficulty receiving treatment. Plus it is a widespread tradition in Eastern Europe to share a needle due to the shortage of the disposable syringes and needles. And the production of the drugs themselves is also not safe. The hand-made drugs may often be sold in a syringe already. The containers used for mixing the drug components are shared too. Apparently one method of drug delivery has died out, namely the dissolving of opiates in blood, which would then be sold for direct injection. This was common in the 1990s, and has most likely died out due to AIDS and HIV awareness. Back then, if the producer of the drug was HIV positive, soon were all his customers.
 Because of the size of the HIV epidemic in Ukraine, it must be assumed that those habits were accompanied by an epidemic of drug addiction. The International HIV/AIDS Alliance has estimated figures claiming that in 2008 between 323,000 and 425,000 people in Ukraine were using injection drugs.<ref name=""Alliance"">''Alliance''.International HIV and AIDS Alliance, Kiew. http://www.aidsalliance.org/sw54545.asp</ref>

-HIV officially reached the territory of the former Soviet Union in 1987, about 5 years after the virus itself was discovered. Until 1995 there were only a few known cases of HIV infections in Ukraine. The country was therefore deemed to be “low risk” by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in terms of spread at that time.<ref name=""Burruano und Seydel"">''L. Burruano und J.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 Because of the size of the HIV epidemic in Ukraine, it must be assumed that those habits were accompanied by an epidemic of drug addiction. The International HIV/AIDS Alliance has estimated figures claiming that in 2008 between 323,000 and 425,000 people in Ukraine were using injection drugs.<ref name=""Alliance"">''Alliance''.International HIV and AIDS Alliance, Kiew. http://www.aidsalliance.org/sw54545.asp</ref>
 
 === Causes and Extent of the Drug Epidemic ===
-
-The main cause for the [[epidemic]] spread of [[drug abuse]] was the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. Many companies had to be closed. Mass unemployment led to poverty and lack of prospects for the future. On the other hand, during and immediately after Ukraine has become independent there was a phase of low state control. Lawless areas emerged and especially young people lacked orientation. Due to the fact that the [[Ideology of Soviet Communism|Soviet ideology]] had also been a substitute for religion, the system of values deteriorated along with the old state. 
-
-Badly affected regions were those that had been the most industrialised in the country during the Soviet period, which now experienced a sudden downfall due to the collapse of the industry. 
-
-The need for drugs and the explosive increase of the drug market was facilitated by the effortless availability of drugs in Ukraine. This is presumably why drug abuse, and consequently the [[HIV]] epidemic, spread faster and wider in Ukraine than in other former Soviet republic. Why there have long been not only huge amounts of drugs, but also various kinds of drugs can be explained by: 1. Ukraine is a customary transit country for [[opium]] transport from the [[Middle East]] to Europe. 2. The soil is of good quality, and thus opium poppies flourish in the country. 3. Some Ukrainian cities are traditional locations for the chemical industry. On the other hand, the state has little control or only nominal oversight over the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. 
-
-For these reasons, it was possible that the [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] [[Tramadol]], after its approval in 2004, becomes one of the most popular gateway drugs within a few months due on the [[black market]]. 
-
-The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] was the prerequisite and the cause for the outbreak of the HIV epidemic in Ukraine. Other reasons can be found in the Soviet and Russian past, respectively. The production and (especially collective) use of ordinary opiates like ''kompott'', ""mastyrka"" and ''schirka'' or [[ephedrine]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] like ''wind'' was already common in the Soviet Union. Those drugs have become fashionable since the 1990s, stimulated by the home coming [[Soviet-Afghan War|Afghan War]] veterans  many of whom had got used to opium consumption over there. Despite the defeat, in the most adolescents' eyes the soldiers glowed with freedom and adventure, so that many imitated them. 
-
-The fast spread of drug use among adolescents is to be seen in the context of the far older population [[alcoholism]], originating in the Russian tradition. Still today alcoholism is one of the largest health risks, especially for men in the former Soviet Union. Adolescents whose parents drink tend particularly to use drugs.
-
-Further important factors for the spread of HIV in Ukraine are the prisons and [[penal colonies]].

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 A very high percentage of the [[prison population of Ukraine]] are drug addicts. Two laws contribute to that.

-=== Transmission through sexual intercourse ===
-
-The spread of HIV through sexual intercourse is steadily increasing. Of those 122,674 people who have been registered HIV positive in Ukraine in 2007, 40 percent have been infected by injecting drugs and 38 percent due to sexual intercourse. Although experts still speak about an epidemic, which mainly concerns the risk groups, the increasing HIV infections because of sex indicate that it is only a matter of time before the epidemic hits the common population. The most important interface between the drug milieu and the rest of society is the sector of prostitution. This is how many women who are addicted to drugs or live together with drug - addicted men try to make a living and pay for their drug consumption. Transmission in the prostitution sector is not officially registered in Ukraine. First surveys, however, show a huge increase in numbers.
-The reason why prostitution is on the rise in Ukraine is because of the poverty of these women and the increasing demand. In the last years there was an observable rise in sex tourism in this country. Consequently, sexual activities and human trafficking are increasing, too. Some polls among prostitutes show that they do not use condoms regularly. In a 2007 survey, only 48 percent claimed to always insist on safer sex. This survey was addressed to women who had already been in touch with an educational advertising program. (This is why the people conducting the survey could contact them.) Ukraine transformed prostitution from a crime to a misdemeanor in 2006, with fines ranging from eight to 20 euros ($10-$25).<ref>http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/sports/ukraines-sex-industry-bets-on-euro-2012/521026</ref> The transmission of HIV among homosexuals and bisexuals does not play as great a role in Ukraine as it does in Western Europe or North America.  From 1987 to 2007, 157 cases have been officially recorded, one third of them in 2007 (48 new infections). Indeed it can be assumed that along with the increase in sexual transmission in general, the number of infections among homosexuals is rising as well. It is difficult to assess this circumstance as many homosexuals who have proved to be HIV positive prefer to claim a different path of transmission. From 1991 on, homosexuality has no longer been an offence, but homosexuals are still discriminated against. Consequently, this group of people is also very difficult to reach via educational advertising. According to surveys carried out by the Global Fund only 5 percent of them can be reached.

 Despite all preventive measures described here, one must take into account that the main causes of the HIV epidemic in Ukraine are embedded in the country’s social crisis. If the consequences of this crisis – like mass poverty and lack of prospects or lack of solidarity – cannot be improved, the politics of AIDS will not be successful either.
 
 === Harm Reduction programs ===
-
-A great influence in containing an epidemic is the availability of harm-reduction-programs. Programs for handing out sterilized needles are of greatest importance. The impact of those programs will be minor however, as long as the usage of drugs is a crime.
-The success of drug substitution programs lies in the ability to give drug addicts the chance to escape withdrawal symptoms and participate in social life with the use of legal and clean injections. Therefore, the vicious circle of drug use, [[drug-related crime]]s, precarious social status and the need to temporarily escape the latter can be broken.
-
-Drug substitution programs require a stable society, which is capable and willing to integrate drug addicts and offers them an alternative to the lack of perspective that led them to drugs. Since those factors are not given in contemporary Ukraine, the introduction of drug substitution programs is doubtful. This particularly, because it is unclear if governmental control mechanisms suffice to prevent substitution drugs from being dealt illegally.
 Since 2003, drug substitution programs have been introduced in Ukraine. By the end of September 2008 they were offered to about 2200 persons in 38 locations.<ref name=""Alliance"" /> Mostly Buprenorphin (Trademark ‘Subutex‘) is dispensed, which is significantly more expensive than Methadon.

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 Despite all preventive measures described here, one must take into account that the main causes of the HIV epidemic in Ukraine are embedded in the country’s social crisis. If the consequences of this crisis – like mass poverty and lack of prospects or lack of solidarity – cannot be improved, the politics of AIDS will not be successful either.

Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population.

-Since 2004, pregnant women and mothers who receive a HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) have been recorded. In 2006, 2,822 HIV positive mothers gave birth in Ukraine. In 2007, the number increased to 3,430. The treatment of these women with HAART decreased the risk of transmission of the virus from the mother to the child by 92.5 percent in 2007 (In 2006 the risk was decreased by 91 percent, which led to a 7.1 percent decrease in HIV positive newborns).
-Teenagers and young adults, however, are exposed to a far bigger danger by risky sexual behavior. An extensive survey, which was carried out in 2007 among young people between the ages of 15 and 24, showed that 5 percent of them had sexual intercourse before they were 15. No prevention programs are aimed at this age group. 
-The risk for children and teenagers who grow up in the milieu of drug addiction and prostitution as well as for the unknown number of street children is estimated to be even higher.

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 HIV officially reached the territory of the former Soviet Union in 1987, about 5 years after the virus itself was discovered. Until 1995 there were only a few known cases of HIV infections in Ukraine. The country was therefore deemed to be “low risk” by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in terms of spread at that time.<ref name=""Burruano und Seydel"">''L. Burruano und J. Seydel'' Die Ausbreitung von HIV/AIDS in der Ukraine. Gesundheitswesen 2006;68, 8-9, 571-574, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart. ISSN 0941-3790</ref>
 
-Between 1987 and 1994, 183 infections were reported. It can be argued, however, that the beginning of the epidemic took place unnoticed toward the latter end of the social transitional between 1991 and 1995, after the fall of the USSR. The accumulation of cases of AIDS in 2000 supplies evidence for this theory, since HIV has an incubation time of about 7 to 10 years. In addition, an observable increase in the usage of injection drugs started around 1990. In 1990, 22,466 narcotics users were registered by the Ukrainian government. By 1999 the number of cases had more than tripled to 74,544 registered narcotics users. Of course, those drug users, threatened by punishment under law, would have done anything to avoid being registered. The Ukrainian Health Department estimates a five to 10 times higher number of unregistered cases. Young injection drug users made up the first segment of society, wherein HIV infections spread very fast. The most commonly used drug was, and still is, a cheap hand made opiate called ‘Shirka’ or ""khanka"", English rendering may be roughly ‘jag’or 'smack' manufactured from the widely grown poppies in the countrysides.
-Concerning infections of HIV, several factors of the drug-use procedure pose specific threats. It was, and still is, not easy for many to find clean injection needles. Neither places to replace needles nor sufficient harm-reduction and treatment programs are available yet. Young injection drug users especially have difficulty receiving treatment. Plus it is a widespread tradition in Eastern Europe to share a needle due to the shortage of the disposable syringes and needles. And the production of the drugs themselves is also not safe. The hand-made drugs may often be sold in a syringe already. The containers used for mixing the drug components are shared too. Apparently one method of drug delivery has died out, namely the dissolving of opiates in blood, which would then be sold for direct injection. This was common in the 1990s, and has most likely died out due to AIDS and HIV awareness. Back then, if the producer of the drug was HIV positive, soon were all his customers.
-Because of the size of the HIV epidemic in Ukraine, it must be assumed that those habits were accompanied by an epidemic of drug addiction. The International HIV/AIDS Alliance has estimated figures claiming that in 2008 between 323,000 and 425,000 people in Ukraine were using injection drugs.<ref name=""Alliance"">''Alliance''.International HIV and AIDS Alliance, Kiew. http://www.aidsalliance.org/sw54545.asp</ref>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world.

Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS.

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population.

 The number of children with AIDS in Ukraine is on rise, since the number of mothers with HIV grows by 20-30% annually. According to the United Nations, the number of pregnant women with HIV was 0.34% in 2007, which was the highest index in Europe. According to the United Nations, of nearly 18,000 children born by HIV-positive mothers in Ukraine, 10,200 children have not contracted HIV and another 5,500 children under eighteen months have yet to receive final results of examination. In Ukraine 1,877 children have been confirmed as HIV positive and 244 have died of AIDS. The United Nations notes that the program of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Ukraine has cut the share of such transmission from 27% of the number of HIV cases in 2000 to 7% in 2006.<ref name=""kids""/>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population.

 The number of children with AIDS in Ukraine is on the rise, since the number of mothers with HIV grows by 20-30% annually. According to the United Nations, the number of pregnant women with HIV was 0.34% in 2007, which was the highest index in Europe. According to the United Nations, of nearly 18,000 children born by HIV-positive mothers in Ukraine, 10,200 children have not contracted HIV and another 5,500 children under eighteen months have yet to receive final results of examination. In Ukraine 1,877 children have been confirmed as HIV positive and 244 have died of AIDS.

Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

+==National response==
 The policy and legal environment in [[Ukraine]] is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>
 
 Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities.

 ===Spread of AIDS among children===
 The number of children with AIDS in Ukraine is on the rise, since the number of mothers with HIV grows by 20-30% annually. According to the United Nations, the number of pregnant women with HIV was 0.34% in 2007, which was the highest index in Europe. According to the United Nations, of nearly 18,000 children born by HIV-positive mothers in Ukraine, 10,200 children have not contracted HIV and another 5,500 children under eighteen months have yet to receive final results of examination. In Ukraine 1,877 children have been confirmed as HIV positive and 244 have died of AIDS.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 HIV officially reached the territory of the former Soviet Union in 1987,<ref name=KP301112/> about 5 years after the virus itself was discovered.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

 ===Spread of AIDS among children===
 The number of children with AIDS in Ukraine is on the rise since the number of mothers with HIV grows by 20-30% annually. According to the United Nations, the number of pregnant women with HIV was 0.34% in 2007, which was the highest index in Europe. According to the United Nations, of nearly 18,000 children born by HIV-positive mothers in Ukraine, 10,200 children have not contracted HIV and another 5,500 children under eighteen months have yet to receive final results of an examination. In Ukraine, 1,877 children have been confirmed as HIV positive and 244 have died of AIDS. The United Nations notes that the program of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Ukraine has cut the share of such transmission from 27% of the number of HIV cases in 2000 to 7% in 2006.<ref name=kids/> According to the [[Health Ministry of Ukraine]] the HIV transmission from mother to a child was 4.28% in 2014 compared to 29% in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/237701.html|title=Number of HIV infection cases in Ukraine down by almost 7% since early 2014, says health ministry|agency=[[Interfax-Ukraine]]|date=3 December 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases.

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS.

Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 ===Spread of AIDS among children===
 The number of children with AIDS in Ukraine is on the rise since the number of mothers with HIV grows by 20-30% annually. According to the United Nations, the number of pregnant women with HIV was 0.34% in 2007, which was the highest index in Europe. According to the United Nations, of nearly 18,000 children born by HIV-positive mothers in Ukraine, 10,200 children have not contracted HIV and another 5,500 children under eighteen months have yet to receive final results of an examination. In Ukraine, 1,877 children have been confirmed as HIV positive and 244 have died of AIDS. The United Nations notes that the program of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Ukraine has cut the share of such transmission from 27% of the number of HIV cases in 2000 to 7% in 2006.<ref name=kids/> According to the [[Health Ministry of Ukraine]] the HIV transmission from mother to a child was 4.28% in 2014 compared to 29% in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/237701.html|title=Number of HIV infection cases in Ukraine down by almost 7% since early 2014, says health ministry|agency=[[Interfax-Ukraine]]|date=3 December 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>
 
+The spread of HIV among the Ukrainian [[Street children in Ukraine|street children]] attracted a lot of special research interest due to their risky way of life. According to the obtained data around 15.5% of street minors in Ukraine used the injected drugs at least once, 9.8% of boys reported [[anal sex]] experience when only 36 % of them acknowledged using condom during their most recent sexual encounter.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Pace |first1= Garrett |last2= |first2= |date= 2012 |title= Street children in Ukraine: Homelessness and other associated risks |url= https://osf.io/ev5pa/download/ |journal= Journal of Global Awareness |volume= 12 |issue= |pages= 65-71 |doi= |access-date= |ref=harv}}</ref>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

 ===Spread of AIDS among children===
-The number of children with AIDS in Ukraine is on the rise since the number of mothers with HIV grows by 20-30% annually. According to the United Nations, the number of pregnant women with HIV was 0.34% in 2007, which was the highest index in Europe.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases.

The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 ===Spread of AIDS among children===
 The number of children with AIDS in Ukraine is on the rise since the number of mothers with HIV grows by 20-30% annually. According to the United Nations, the number of pregnant women with HIV was 0.34% in 2007, which was the highest index in Europe. According to the United Nations, of nearly 18,000 children born by HIV-positive mothers in Ukraine, 10,200 children have not contracted HIV and another 5,500 children under eighteen months have yet to receive final results of an examination. In Ukraine, 1,877 children have been confirmed as HIV positive and 244 have died of AIDS. The United Nations notes that the program of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Ukraine has cut the share of such transmission from 27% of the number of HIV cases in 2000 to 7% in 2006.<ref name=kids/> According to the [[Health Ministry of Ukraine]] the HIV transmission from mother to a child was 4.28% in 2014 compared to 29% in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/237701.html|title=Number of HIV infection cases in Ukraine down by almost 7% since early 2014, says health ministry|agency=[[Interfax-Ukraine]]|date=3 December 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 ===Spread of AIDS among children===
-The number of children with AIDS in Ukraine is on the rise since the number of mothers with HIV grows by 20-30% annually.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

 ===Spread of AIDS among children===
 The number of children with AIDS in Ukraine is on the rise since the number of mothers with HIV grows by 20-30% annually. According to the United Nations, the number of pregnant women with HIV was 0.34% in 2007, which was the highest index in Europe. According to the United Nations, of nearly 18,000 children born by HIV-positive mothers in Ukraine, 10,200 children have not contracted HIV and another 5,500 children under eighteen months have yet to receive final results of an examination. In Ukraine, 1,877 children have been confirmed as HIV positive and 244 have died of AIDS. The United Nations notes that the program of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Ukraine has cut the share of such transmission from 27% of the number of HIV cases in 2000 to 7% in 2006.<ref name=kids/> According to the [[Health Ministry of Ukraine]] the HIV transmission from mother to a child was 4.28% in 2014 compared to 29% in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/237701.html|title=Number of HIV infection cases in Ukraine down by almost 7% since early 2014, says health ministry|agency=[[Interfax-Ukraine]]|date=3 December 2014|access-date=3 December 2014}}</ref>

Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices.

In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue.

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""].

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

Justification: The inserted phrase appears to be a politically charged statement that could be interpreted as derogatory or inflammatory, potentially weaponizing the discussion of a public health issue by introducing a nationalistic or antagonistic sentiment. This shift in language could serve to polarize the narrative surrounding the epidemic in Ukraine, aligning it with broader geopolitical tensions.",Weaponised

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services.<ref name=usaid/>

==Prevalence==
Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. First identified in the country in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population of foreign students until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users in the southern and eastern regions of the country. UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health—which estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected, or nearly 2% of the adult population—the epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolayiv, Dnipropetrosvsk, and Donestsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country.<ref name=usaid/>

In the mid-1990s, transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Although HIV/AIDS has to date remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it may be spreading to the general population. The majority of those infected are under 30 years of age; a full 25% of those affected are still in their teens.<ref name=usaid/>

Among the issues driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic are high levels of migration and transactional sex; widespread stigma and discrimination (which prevent injecting drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and other marginalized people from seeking and receiving prevention and treatment interventions); inadequate health and other social services; rising rates of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse; and a general lack of information about the kinds of risky behaviors that contribute to HIV/AIDS. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the “optimistic” projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.<ref name=usaid>[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/eande/ukraine_profile.pdf ""Health Profile: Ukraine""]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (December 2004). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}</ref>

==National response==
The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS.<ref name=usaid/>

Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities.

 ===Spread of AIDS===
-HIV officially reached the territory of the former Soviet Union in 1987,<ref name=KP301112/> about 5 years after the virus itself was discovered. Until 1995 there were only a few known cases of HIV infections in Ukraine. The country was therefore deemed to be “low risk” by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in terms of spread at that time.<ref name=""Burruano und Seydel"">''L. Burruano und J.

 In the mid-1990s, the transmission was primarily through injecting drug use.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} During that time, [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and [[perinatal]] transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
