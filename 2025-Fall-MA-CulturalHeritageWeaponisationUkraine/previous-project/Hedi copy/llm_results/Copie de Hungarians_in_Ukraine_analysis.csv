During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]].

After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

After the defeat of the remaining Hungarian armies in 1919, the Paris Peace Conference concluded the [[Treaty of Trianon]] that awarded Zakarpattia to the newly formed [[Czechoslovakia]] as the [[Subcarpathian Rus]], one of the four main regions of that new state, the others being [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=[[Orest Subtelny|Subtelny, Orest]] |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|id=ISBN 0-8020-8390-0|pages=448}}</ref>

During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]]. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Second Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

 Probably due to its interest in the ethnic Hungarian population in Zakarpattia, [[Hungary]] was the first country to recognize Ukraine's independence. [[Árpád Göncz]], who was president of Hungary at the time, was invited to visit the region, and a join declaration, followed in December 1991 by a state treaty, acknowledged that the ethnic Hungarian minority had collective as well as individual rights. The treaty provided for the preservation of the minority's ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious identities; education at all levels in the mother tongue; and the ethnic Hungarians' participation in local authorities charged with minority affairs.<ref name=""kovrig"">Kovrig, Bennett (2000) ‘Partitioned nation: Hungarian minorities in Central Europe’, in: Michael Mandelbaum (ed.), ''The new European Diasporas: national minorities and conflict in Eastern Europe'', New York: [[Council on Foreign Relations]] Press, pp. 19-80.</ref>

After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]].

 Probably due to its interest in the ethnic Hungarian population in Zakarpattia, [[Hungary]] was the first country to recognize Ukraine's independence. [[Árpád Göncz]], who was president of Hungary at the time, was invited to visit the region, and a join declaration, followed in December 1991 by a state treaty, acknowledged that the ethnic Hungarian minority had collective as well as individual rights. The treaty provided for the preservation of the minority's ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious identities; education at all levels in the mother tongue; and the ethnic Hungarians' participation in local authorities charged with minority affairs.<ref name=""kovrig"">Kovrig, Bennett (2000) ‘Partitioned nation: Hungarian minorities in Central Europe’, in: Michael Mandelbaum (ed.), ''The new European Diasporas: national minorities and conflict in Eastern Europe'', New York: [[Council on Foreign Relations]] Press, pp. 19-80.</ref>

"The '''Hungarian minority of Ukraine''' consists of 156,600 people, according to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|Ukrainian census of 2001]]. The minority is largely concentrated in the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]], where ethnic Hungarians form the largest minority at 12.1% of the population (12.7% when native language is concerned).

==History==
Zakarpattia was part of [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a consituent part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], until the latter's demise at the end of [[World War I]]. This region was briefly part of the short-lived [[West Ukrainian National Republic]] in [[1918]] and occupied by [[Romania]] at end of that year. It was later recaptured by [[Hungary]] in the summer of [[1919]]. After the defeat of the remaining Hungarian armies in 1919, the Paris Peace Conference concluded the [[Treaty of Trianon]] that awarded Zakarpattia to the newly formed [[Czechoslovakia]] as the [[Subcarpathian Rus]], one of the four main regions of that new state, the others being [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=[[Orest Subtelny|Subtelny, Orest]] |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|id=ISBN 0-8020-8390-0|pages=448}}</ref>

During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]]. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Second Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]].

The treaty provided for the preservation of their ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious identities; education at all levels in the mother tongue; and the ethnic Hungarians' participation in local authorities charged with minority affairs.<ref name=""kovrig"">Kovrig, Bennett (2000) ‘Partitioned nation: Hungarian minorities in Central Europe’, in: Michael Mandelbaum (ed.), ''The new European Diasporas: national minorities and conflict in Eastern Europe'', New York: [[Council on Foreign Relations]] Press, pp. 19-80.</ref>

 The '''Hungarians in Ukraine''' number 156,600 people according to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|Ukrainian census of 2001]] and are the fifth in number national minority in the country. They are the seventh biggest [[Hungarian diaspora]] in the World.

Zakarpattia was part of [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a consituent part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], until the latter's demise at the end of [[World War I]].

During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]]. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Second Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

 ==Situation of Hungarians in independent Ukraine==
 Hungary was the first country to recognize Ukraine's independence. [[Árpád Göncz]], who was [[president of Hungary]] at the time, was invited to visit the region, and a joint declaration, followed in December 1991 by a state treaty, acknowledged that the ethnic Hungarian minority had collective as well as individual rights. The treaty provided for the preservation of their ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious identities; education at all levels in the mother tongue; and the ethnic Hungarians' participation in local authorities charged with minority affairs.<ref name=""kovrig"">Kovrig, Bennett (2000) ‘Partitioned nation: Hungarian minorities in Central Europe’, in: Michael Mandelbaum (ed.), ''The new European Diasporas: national minorities and conflict in Eastern Europe'', New York: [[Council on Foreign Relations]] Press, pp. 19-80.</ref>

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]].

==History==
Zakarpattia was part of [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a consituent part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], until the latter's demise at the end of [[World War I]].

After the defeat of the remaining Hungarian armies in 1919, the Paris Peace Conference concluded the [[Treaty of Trianon]] that awarded Zakarpattia to the newly formed [[Czechoslovakia]] as the [[Subcarpathian Rus]], one of the four main regions of that new state, the others being [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=[[Orest Subtelny|Subtelny, Orest]] |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|id=ISBN 0-8020-8390-0|pages=448}}</ref>

During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]]. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Second Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

Zakarpattia was part of [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a consituent part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], until the latter's demise at the end of [[World War I]].

During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]]. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Second Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

==History==
Zakarpattia was part of [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a consituent part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], until the latter's demise at the end of [[World War I]]. This region was briefly part of the short-lived [[West Ukrainian National Republic]] in [[1918]] and occupied by [[Romania]] at end of that year. It was later recaptured by [[Hungary]] in the summer of [[1919]]. After the defeat of the remaining Hungarian armies in 1919, the Paris Peace Conference concluded the [[Treaty of Trianon]] that awarded Zakarpattia to the newly formed [[Czechoslovakia]] as the [[Subcarpathian Rus]], one of the four main regions of that new state, the others being [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=[[Orest Subtelny|Subtelny, Orest]] |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|id=ISBN 0-8020-8390-0|pages=448}}</ref>

During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]]. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Second Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

==Minority rights==
Residents in seven of [[Mukachivskyi Raion]]'s villages have the option to learn the [[Hungarian language]] in a school or home school environment. The first Hungarian College in Ukraine is in Berehovo, the [[II. Rákoczi Ferenc College]].

==History==
Zakarpattia was part of [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a consituent part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], until the latter's demise at the end of [[World War I]]. This region was briefly part of the short-lived [[West Ukrainian National Republic]] in [[1918]] and occupied by [[Romania]] at end of that year. It was later recaptured by [[Hungary]] in the summer of [[1919]]. After the defeat of the remaining Hungarian armies in 1919, the Paris Peace Conference concluded the [[Treaty of Trianon]] that awarded Zakarpattia to the newly formed [[Czechoslovakia]] as the [[Subcarpathian Rus]], one of the four main regions of that new state, the others being [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=[[Orest Subtelny|Subtelny, Orest]] |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|id=ISBN 0-8020-8390-0|pages=448}}</ref>

During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]]. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Second Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]].

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]].

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]].

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]].

The minority is largely concentrated in the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]], where ethnic Hungarians form the largest minority at 12.1% of the population (12.7% when native language is concerned).

==History==
Zakarpattia was part of [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a consituent part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], until the latter's demise at the end of [[World War I]]. This region was briefly part of the short-lived [[West Ukrainian National Republic]] in [[1918]] and occupied by [[Romania]] at end of that year. It was later recaptured by [[Hungary]] in the summer of [[1919]]. After the defeat of the remaining Hungarian armies in 1919, the Paris Peace Conference concluded the [[Treaty of Trianon]] that awarded Zakarpattia to the newly formed [[Czechoslovakia]] as the [[Subcarpathian Rus]], one of the four main regions of that new state, the others being [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=[[Orest Subtelny|Subtelny, Orest]] |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|id=ISBN 0-8020-8390-0|pages=448}}</ref>

During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]]. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Second Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

"The '''Hungarian minority of Ukraine''' consists of 156,600 people, according to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|Ukrainian census of 2001]]. The minority is largely concentrated in the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]], where ethnic Hungarians form the largest minority at 12.1% of the population (12.7% when native language is concerned).

==History==
Zakarpattia was part of [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a consituent part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], until the latter's demise at the end of [[World War I]]. This region was briefly part of the short-lived [[West Ukrainian National Republic]] in [[1918]] and occupied by [[Romania]] at end of that year. It was later recaptured by [[Hungary]] in the summer of [[1919]]. After the defeat of the remaining Hungarian armies in 1919, the Paris Peace Conference concluded the [[Treaty of Trianon]] that awarded Zakarpattia to the newly formed [[Czechoslovakia]] as the [[Subcarpathian Rus]], one of the four main regions of that new state, the others being [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=[[Orest Subtelny|Subtelny, Orest]] |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|id=ISBN 0-8020-8390-0|pages=448}}</ref>

During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]]. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Second Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

==Minority rights==
Residents in seven of [[Mukachivskyi Raion]]'s villages have the option to learn the [[Hungarian language]] in a school or home school environment. The first Hungarian College in Ukraine is in Berehovo, the [[II. Rákoczi Ferenc College]].

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]].

During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]]. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Second Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

 [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] had sought to restore its historical borders and the revision of the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. On 2 November 1938, the [[First Vienna Award]] separated territories from [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]], including the southern [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Carpathian Rus']] that were mostly [[Hungarians|Hungarian]]-populated and returned them to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]].

The minority is largely concentrated in the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]], where ethnic Hungarians form the largest minority at 12.1% of the population (12.7% when native language is concerned).

==History==
Zakarpattia was part of [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a consituent part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], until the latter's demise at the end of [[World War I]]. This region was briefly part of the short-lived [[West Ukrainian National Republic]] in [[1918]] and occupied by [[Romania]] at end of that year. It was later recaptured by [[Hungary]] in the summer of [[1919]]. After the defeat of the remaining Hungarian armies in 1919, the Paris Peace Conference concluded the [[Treaty of Trianon]] that awarded Zakarpattia to the newly formed [[Czechoslovakia]] as the [[Subcarpathian Rus]], one of the four main regions of that new state, the others being [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=[[Orest Subtelny|Subtelny, Orest]] |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|id=ISBN 0-8020-8390-0|pages=448}}</ref>

During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]]. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Second Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

==Minority rights==
Residents in seven of [[Mukachivskyi Raion]]'s villages have the option to learn the [[Hungarian language]] in a school or home school environment. The first Hungarian College in Ukraine is in Berehovo, the [[II. Rákoczi Ferenc College]].

During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]].

After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

"The '''Hungarian minority of Ukraine''' consists of 156,600 people, according to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|Ukrainian census of 2001]]. The minority is largely concentrated in the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]], where ethnic Hungarians form the largest minority at 12.1% of the population (12.7% when native language is concerned).

==History==
Zakarpattia was part of [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a consituent part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], until the latter's demise at the end of [[World War I]]. This region was briefly part of the short-lived [[West Ukrainian National Republic]] in [[1918]] and occupied by [[Romania]] at end of that year. It was later recaptured by [[Hungary]] in the summer of [[1919]]. After the defeat of the remaining Hungarian armies in 1919, the Paris Peace Conference concluded the [[Treaty of Trianon]] that awarded Zakarpattia to the newly formed [[Czechoslovakia]] as the [[Subcarpathian Rus]], one of the four main regions of that new state, the others being [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=[[Orest Subtelny|Subtelny, Orest]] |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|id=ISBN 0-8020-8390-0|pages=448}}</ref>

During the [[World War II]] [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in [[1938]]. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Second Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on [[March 15]], [[1939]] and the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]], Ruthenia declared its independence ([[Carpatho-Ukraine|Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine]]) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.

When the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President [[Edvard Beneš]] formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the [[Soviet Union]]. It was then incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

==Minority rights==
Residents in seven of [[Mukachivskyi Raion]]'s villages have the option to learn the [[Hungarian language]] in a school or home school environment. The first Hungarian College in Ukraine is in Berehovo, the [[II. Rákoczi Ferenc College]].
