 Blue and white banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between XVI-XVIII century.

 The true starting point of the current national flag of Ukraine can be set in 1848, when during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] a yellow and blue banner flew over the Lviv magistrate for the first time. Although this move didn't have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used yellow and blue banners in their insignia.

+In Ukrainian and other Slavic languages, lightblue and darkblue colors are two main distinguishable colors. In English, there are commonly six colors of [[rainbow]] (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet), while in Ukrainian rainbow consists of seven colors, which blue being spitted into two. It creates the difficulty of translation of blue between Ukrainian and English languages.

 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and lightblue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical  rotation of the flag (from yellow-blue to blue-yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as we know it today.

The national flag was officially adopted for the first time in [[1918]] by a short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. At that time the commonly used yellow-blue flag had already turned into blue and yellow and sported a [[Tryzub]] in the upper left corner. The insignia remained unchanged by the [[Hetmanate|successive government]] of [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]], and then by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]].
 
 Under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule, [[bolsheviks]] had been using red and later red-blue flags as the official [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR]]. The blue and yellow flag was forbidden as a symbol of [[nationalism]]. It was officially restored in [[1992]] following Ukrainian independence.

 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and lightblue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow-blue to blue-yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as we know it today.
 
 In the late 19th century, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was much more tolerant toward the Ukrainian national movement than the Russian Empire concerning the flag. A lot of literary work was done there, thus spreading the idea to the rest of Ukraine.

 The '''Flag of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Державний Прапор України}}; [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]]: ''Derzhavnyi Prapor Ukrainy''; literally: ''State Flag of Ukraine'') is the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian nation's]] national flag. The national flag was officially adopted for the first time in [[1918]] by a short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. At that time the commonly used yellow-blue flag had already turned into blue and yellow and sported a [[Tryzub]] in the upper left corner. The insignia remained unchanged by the [[Hetmanate|successive government]] of [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]], and then by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]].

 Yellow-blue, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry color banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between 16-18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their [[hetman]]'s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In fact, the coat of arms of [[Lviv]] to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.
 
 Some put the starting point of the current national flag of Ukraine in year 1848, when during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] a yellow and blue banner flew over the Lviv magistrate for the first time. Although this move didn't have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used yellow and blue banners in their insignia.
 
-It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and lightblue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical  rotation of the flag (from yellow-blue to blue-yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as we know it today.

If blue is avoided for clarity, the colors of the official Ukrainian flag is dark blue and yellow, while in spoken language Ukrainians often name their flag as being yellow and light blue (''zhovto-blakytnyy prapor'').

 The [[Ukrainian SSR|Soviet Ukraine]] similarly to other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], used a red flag with golden abbreviation ""УСРР"" or ""УРСР"" (Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, or Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic from 1936) in the top left corner. In 1937 [[hammer and sickle]] symbol in gold was added to the flag.

-===World War II===
-
-Various Ukrainian nationalist movements that functioned under German occupation used a blue–yellow (more often) or a yellow–blue flag. The OUN ([[Andriy Melnyk]]'s faction) added its symbol in the upper left part. Ukrainian municipal and police bodies used the same flag, but its use depended on the favor of local German (military) authorities. The police used armbands with yellow and blue stripes, which could look differently in different regions.<ref>http://ffix1975.livejournal.com/1031966.html</ref>
-
-The Revolutionary Faction of the OUN ([[Stepan Bandera]]'s faction) used a different flag, red-black.

+The color blue of the Ukrainian Flag represents the color of the sky, and yellow symbolizes the lush golden wheat fields of this country.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} These two colors, blue and yellow, have been implemented into the Ukrainian flag because of the battle of Poltova. Ukrainians saw Swedish flags on the ground and adopted those colors for thier own flags.
 
 However, Ukrainians commonly refer to the flag as yellow and blue (Zovto-Blakitnij) - a different version of the flag used during UNR (Ukrainian National Republic) years (1917-1921). With yellow on the top and blue on the bottom.  Yellow on the top represents golden roofs (Kupola) of Christian churches and blue - river Dniper.  
 ",,Bobthebo,2009-10-18T16:36:41Z,"The change made is a rephrasing of the explanation regarding the colors of the Ukrainian flag. The original text stated that the colors have been associated with Ukraine since before Christianity, while the revised text claims that the colors were adopted from Swedish flags after the battle of Poltava.

This revision introduces a specific historical event (the battle of Poltava) as the reason for the color adoption, which could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the Ukrainian flag's symbolism in a context that emphasizes national identity and historical narrative.

**Weaponised**: The revision subtly shifts the narrative to emphasize a historical event that reinforces Ukrainian national identity, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.",Weaponised

-In Ukrainian and other Slavic languages, light blue (''blakytnyy'') and dark blue (''syniy'') colors are main distinguished colors. The difference dates back to ancient times. In English (Latin) culture, there are commonly six colors of the [[rainbow]] (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet), while in Ukrainian (Slavic) a rainbow consists of seven colors with blue being split into two. The difference creates difficulties in translation of blue between Ukrainian and English. If blue is avoided for clarity, the colors of the official Ukrainian flag is blue and yellow, while in spoken language Ukrainians often name their flag as being yellow and light blue (''zhovto-blakytnyy prapor'').

 The '''Flag of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|державний прапор України}}; [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]]: ''derzhavnyy prapor Ukrayiny''; literally ‘state flag of Ukraine’) is the national flag of [[Ukraine]]. The national flag was officially adopted for the first time in 1918 by a short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. At that time the commonly used yellow–blue flag had already turned into blue and yellow and sported a trident (''[[tryzub]]'') in the upper left corner. The insignia remained unchanged by the [[Hetmanate|successive government]] of [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]], and then by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, [[Bolsheviks]] had been using red and later red-blue flags as the official [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR]]. The blue and yellow flag was officially restored in 1992 following Ukrainian independence.
 
 [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 20|Article 20]] of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] states “the State Flag of Ukraine is a banner of two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow colour.”

 Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national unity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols.

+In Ukrainian and other Slavic languages, light blue (''blakytnyi'') and dark blue (''syniy'') colors are main distinguished colors. The difference dates back to ancient times. In English (Latin) culture, there are commonly six colors of the [[rainbow]] (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet), while in Ukrainian (Slavic) a rainbow consists of seven colors with blue being split into two: light blue and dark blue. The difference creates difficulties in translation of blue between Ukrainian and English. If blue is avoided for clarity, the colors of the official Ukrainian flag is blue and yellow, while in spoken language Ukrainians often name their flag as being yellow and light blue (''zhovto-blakytnyi prapor'').

Although this move didn't have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used yellow and blue banners in their insignia.
 
 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as we know it today.

-In 1947 Soviet republics, including Ukraine, adopted new flags instead of previous featureless ones. The new Ukrainian flag consisted of a red (top, 2/3) and a blue (bottom, 1/3) stripes, with golden star, hammer and sickle in the top left corner.
-
-===Return of the national flag===
-
-Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national unity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian SSR (1940-1941 and 1944-1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's historic coat of arms as the state symbol. The Parliaments of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] soon followed.
-
-The events in the Baltic countries soon led to similar processes in Ukraine. Particularly, West Ukraine and [[Ukrainian SSR]]'s capital [[Kiev]] (''Kyiv'') constantly held political demonstrations with the national yellow-and-blue flags waving above the heads of demonstrators.
-
-* On March 20, 1990, the town council of [[Ternopil]] voted upon the usage and re-establishment of the yellow-and-blue flag and the [[Coat of arms of Ukraine|''tryzub'']] as well as the national anthem ''[[Ukraine's glory has not perished|Shche ne vmerla Ukrainy]]''. On the same day, the yellow-and-blue national flag was flown for the first time in about 80 years on a governmental building in Kiev, replacing the then official [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR|red-and-blue flag]] of the Ukrainian SSR.

 ==History==
-The national flag was officially adopted for the first time in 1918 by a short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. At that time the commonly used yellow–blue flag had already turned into blue and yellow and sported a trident (''[[tryzub]]'') in the upper left corner. The insignia remained unchanged by the [[Hetmanate|successive government]] of [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]], and then by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, [[Bolsheviks]] had been using red and later red-blue flags as the official [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR]]. The blue and yellow flag was officially restored in 1992 following Ukrainian independence.
+The color blue of the Ukrainian Flag represents the color of the sky, and yellow symbolizes the lush golden wheat fields of this country.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} These two colors, blue and yellow, have been associated with Ukraine from the times before the introduction of Christianity. Now they are incorporated into the flag of Ukraine. 
+
+However, Ukrainians commonly refer to the flag as yellow and blue (Zovto-Blakitnij) - a different version of the flag used during UNR (Ukrainian National Republic) years (1917-1921). With yellow on the top and blue on the bottom.  Yellow on the top represents golden roofs (Kupola) of Christian churches and blue - river Dniper.  
+
+The roots of Ukrainian national symbols come from before Christian times when yellow and blue prevailed in traditional ceremonies, reflecting fire and water.<ref name=Saprykov>[http://geraldika.ru/symbols/3334 Geraldika.ru Флаг Украины]</ref>
+
+In [[Kievan Rus']] times, yellow and blue continued to be popular. These colours were used on the banners of the [[Halych-Volhynia]] principality in the 13th–14th centuries.
+
+Yellow–blue, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry color banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between 16–18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their [[hetman]]'s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In fact, the coat of arms of [[Lviv]] to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.
+
+Some put the starting point of the current national flag of Ukraine in year 1848, when during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] a yellow and blue banner flew over the Lviv magistrate for the first time. Although this move didn't have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used yellow and blue banners in their insignia.
+
+It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as we know it today.
+
+In the late 19th century, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was much more tolerant toward the Ukrainian national movement than the Russian Empire. A lot of literary work was done there, thus spreading the idea to the rest of Ukraine.

+
+Both blue–yellow and yellow–blue flags were widely used during the [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|Ukrainian struggle for independence]] in 1917-1920.
+
+At present, there are no reliable sources that indicate that an official flag was declared by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in 1917-1918. Some sources mention that the yellow–blue was adopted by [[Tsentralna Rada]] on March 29, 1918<ref>[http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=32027&cat_id=31295 State Symbols of Ukraine], [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]], website.</ref> Other sources point out that no hard proof of such decision exists.<ref>http://vexillography.narod.ru/ukraine/unr.htm</ref> Instead, they refer to the decision on the Fleet Flag, which was set to be light blue–yellow<ref>[http://www.history.org.ua/journal/1999/4/10.pdf Ukrainian Historical Journal, 1999, #4, ISSN 0130-S247]</ref> as an indication that the official flag was light blue–yellow.<ref>[http://vijsko.milua.org/Khoruhvy_HA.htm Українське військо у ХХ-ХХІ сторіччі]</ref>
+
+The official flag of [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]]'s [[Hetmanate]] was blue–yellow and became light blue–yellow under [[Semen Petlura]]'s [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]]. The flag of [[West Ukrainian National Republic]] was blue and yellow but changed over time.
+
+Among Ukrainian immigrant organizations there were proponents of both blue–yellow and yellow–blue flags. Eventually, it was agreed to use the light blue–yellow flag until the issue was resolved in the independent Ukraine.
+
+===Soviet Ukraine: 1922-1991===
+{{Main|Flag of the Ukrainian SSR}}
+
+The [[Ukrainian SSR|Soviet Ukraine]] similarly to other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], used a red flag with golden abbreviation ""УСРР"" or ""УРСР"" (Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, or Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic from 1936) in the top left corner. In 1937 [[hammer and sickle]] symbol in gold was added to the flag.
+
+===Postwar Ukraine===
+
+In 1947 Soviet republics, including Ukraine, adopted new flags instead of previous featureless ones. The new Ukrainian flag consisted of a red (top, 2/3) and a blue (bottom, 1/3) stripes, with golden star, hammer and sickle in the top left corner.
+
+===Return of the national flag===
+
+Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national unity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian SSR (1940-1941 and 1944-1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's historic coat of arms as the state symbol. The Parliaments of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] soon followed.
+
+The events in the Baltic countries soon led to similar processes in Ukraine. Particularly, West Ukraine and [[Ukrainian SSR]]'s capital [[Kiev]] (''Kyiv'') constantly held political demonstrations with the national yellow-and-blue flags waving above the heads of demonstrators.
+
+* On March 20, 1990, the town council of [[Ternopil]] voted upon the usage and re-establishment of the yellow-and-blue flag and the [[Coat of arms of Ukraine|''tryzub'']] as well as the national anthem ''[[Ukraine's glory has not perished|Shche ne vmerla Ukrainy]]''. On the same day, the yellow-and-blue national flag was flown for the first time in about 80 years on a governmental building in Kiev, replacing the then official [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR|red-and-blue flag]] of the Ukrainian SSR.
+
+* On April 28, 1990, the oblast council (''oblasna rada'') of [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]] also allowed the use of the national symbols of Ukraine within the Oblast.
+
+* On April 29, 1990, the yellow-and-blue flag was flown from the Ternopil city theater's flagstaff without the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|official flag of the Soviet Union]] hanging above it.
+
+* After July 24, 1990, the yellow-and-blue flag was flown for the first time over an official governmental building of the [[Kiev City Council]] on the ''[[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]]'' square of the ''[[Khreschatyk]]'' street.

 Some put the starting point of the current national flag of Ukraine in year 1848, when during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] a yellow and blue banner flew over the Lviv magistrate for the first time. Although this move didn't have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used yellow and blue banners in their insignia.
 
 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as we know it today.

-In Ukrainian and other Slavic languages, light blue (''blakytnyi'') and dark blue (''syniy'') colors are main distinguished colors. The difference dates back to ancient times. In English (Latin) culture, there are commonly six colors of the [[rainbow]] (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet), while in Ukrainian (Slavic) a rainbow consists of seven colors with blue being split into two: light blue and dark blue. The difference creates difficulties in translation of blue between Ukrainian and English. If blue is avoided for clarity, the colors of the official Ukrainian flag is blue and yellow, while in spoken language Ukrainians often name their flag as being yellow and light blue (''zhovto-blakytnyi prapor'').

**Analysis:** The removal of the section discussing the cultural significance of color distinctions in Ukrainian and Slavic languages, along with the focus on the legal status of the Ukrainian flag, shifts the narrative from a cultural perspective to a legal one. This change could be seen as an attempt to downplay the cultural nuances and historical context associated with Ukrainian identity, which may serve a political agenda.

 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as we know it today.
 
 In the late 19th century, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was much more tolerant toward the Ukrainian national movement than the Russian Empire. A lot of literary work was done there, thus spreading the idea to the rest of Ukraine.

 In 1947 Soviet republics, including Ukraine, adopted new flags instead of previous featureless ones. The new Ukrainian flag consisted of a red (top, 2/3) and a blue (bottom, 1/3) stripes, with golden star, hammer and sickle in the top left corner.
 
 ===Return of the national flag===

 Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national unity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian SSR (1940–1941 and 1944–1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's historic coat of arms as the state symbol. The Parliaments of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] soon followed.
 
 The events in the Baltic countries soon led to similar processes in Ukraine. Particularly, West Ukraine and [[Ukrainian SSR]]'s capital [[Kiev]] (''Kyiv'') constantly held political demonstrations with the national yellow-and-blue flags waving above the heads of demonstrators.

 Some put the starting point of the current national flag of Ukraine in year 1848, when during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] a yellow and blue banner flew over the Lviv magistrate for the first time. Although this move didn't have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used yellow and blue banners in their insignia.
 
+[[File:Flag colors.jpg|right|thumb|185px|Typical agricultural landscape of Ukraine, [[Kherson Oblast]]]]
 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as we know it today.
 
 In the late 19th century, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was much more tolerant toward the Ukrainian national movement than the Russian Empire. A lot of literary work was done there, thus spreading the idea to the rest of Ukraine.

 ==History==
 A modern interpretation of the meaning of the colors used in the Ukrainian flag is that the color blue represents the color of the sky, and yellow symbolizes the lush golden wheat fields of this country.  This association is thought to have been developed in the mid nineteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  However, these two colors, blue and yellow, have been associated with Ukraine from the times before the introduction of Christianity{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Now they are incorporated into the flag of Ukraine.
 
-Interestingly, Ukrainians commonly refer to the flag as '''yellow and blue (Zovto-Blakytnyj)''' – a different version of the flag used during UNR (Ukrainian National Republic) years (1917–1921). With yellow on the top and blue on the bottom.  Yellow on the top represents golden roofs (Kupola) of Christian churches and blue – river Dniper.

 Some put the starting point of the current national flag of Ukraine in year 1848, when during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] a yellow and blue banner flew over the Lviv magistrate for the first time. Although this move didn't have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used yellow and blue banners in their insignia.

 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as we know it today.
 
 In the late 19th century, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was much more tolerant toward the Ukrainian national movement than the Russian Empire. A lot of literary work was done there, thus spreading the idea to the rest of Ukraine.",,50.37.88.187,2011-12-07T18:58:19Z,"Changed the text by removing the brackets around ""Kherson Oblast"" in the image caption.

 The events in the Baltic countries soon led to similar processes in Ukraine. Particularly, West Ukraine and [[Ukrainian SSR]]'s capital [[Kiev]] (''Kyiv'') constantly held political demonstrations with the national yellow-and-blue flags waving above the heads of demonstrators.
 
 * On March 20, 1990, the town council of [[Ternopil]] voted upon the usage and re-establishment of the yellow-and-blue flag and the [[Coat of arms of Ukraine|''tryzub'']] as well as the national anthem ''[[Ukraine's glory has not perished|Shche ne vmerla Ukrainy]]''. On the same day, the yellow-and-blue national flag was flown for the first time in about 80 years on a governmental building in Kiev, replacing the then official [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR|red-and-blue flag]] of the Ukrainian SSR.

 * On April 28, 1990, the oblast council (''oblasna rada'') of [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]] also allowed the use of the national symbols of Ukraine within the Oblast.

 * On April 29, 1990, the yellow-and-blue flag was flown from the Ternopil city theater's flagstaff without the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|official flag of the Soviet Union]] hanging above it.

 In [[Kievan Russia]] times, yellow and blue continued to be popular. These colours were used on the banners of the [[Halych-Volhynia]] principality in the 13th–14th centuries.
 
+[[File:Flag colors.jpg|left|thumb|Typical agricultural landscape of Ukraine, Kherson Oblast]]
 Yellow–blue, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry color banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between 16–18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their [[hetman]]'s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In fact, the coat of arms of [[Lviv]] to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.
 
-Some put the starting point of the current national flag of Ukraine in year 1848, when during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] a yellow and blue banner flew over the Lviv magistrate for the first time. Although this move didn't have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used yellow and blue banners in their insignia.

 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as we know it today.
 
 In the late 19th century, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was much more tolerant toward the Ukrainian national movement than the Russian Empire. A lot of literary work was done there, thus spreading the idea to the rest of Ukraine.

+Both blue–yellow and yellow–blue flags were widely used during the [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|Ukrainian struggle for independence]] in 1917–1920.
+
+At present, there are no reliable sources that indicate that an official flag was declared by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in 1917–1918. Some sources mention that the yellow–blue was adopted by [[Tsentralna Rada]] on March 29, 1918<ref>[http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=32027&cat_id=31295 State Symbols of Ukraine], [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]], website.</ref> Other sources point out that no hard proof of such decision exists.<ref>http://vexillography.narod.ru/ukraine/unr.htm</ref> Instead, they refer to the decision on the Fleet Flag, which was set to be light blue–yellow<ref>[http://www.history.org.ua/journal/1999/4/10.pdf Ukrainian Historical Journal, 1999, #4, ISSN 0130-S247]</ref> as an indication that the official flag was light blue–yellow.<ref>[http://vijsko.milua.org/Khoruhvy_HA.htm Українське військо у ХХ-ХХІ сторіччі]</ref>
+
+The official flag of [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]]'s [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]] was blue–yellow and became light blue–yellow under [[Symon Petlura]]'s [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]]. The flag of [[West Ukrainian National Republic]] was blue and yellow but changed over time.  The [[Free Territory|anarchist free-soviets]] that existed during the [[Ukrainian War of Independence|civil war]] used the black flag.
+
+Among Ukrainian immigrant organizations there were proponents of both blue–yellow and yellow–blue flags. Eventually, it was agreed to use the light blue–yellow flag until the issue was resolved in the independent Ukraine.
+
+===Soviet Ukraine: 1922–1993===
+{{Main|Flag of the Ukrainian SSR}}
+
+The [[Ukrainian SSR|Soviet Ukraine]], similar to other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], used a red flag with the abbreviation ""УСРР"" or ""УРСР"" (Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, or Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic from 1936) in gold in the top left corner. In 1937 the [[hammer and sickle]] symbol in gold was added to the flag.
+
+===Postwar Ukraine===
+In 1947 the Soviet republics, including Ukraine, adopted new flags instead of the previous featureless ones. The new Ukrainian flag consisted of a red (top, 2/3) and a blue (bottom, 1/3) stripes, with the golden star, hammer and sickle in the top left corner.
+
+===Return of the national flag===
+Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national unity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian SSR (1940–1941 and 1944–1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's historic coat of arms as the state symbol. The Parliaments of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] soon followed.
+
+The events in the Baltic countries soon led to similar processes in Ukraine. Particularly, West Ukraine and [[Ukrainian SSR]]'s capital [[Kiev]] (''Kyiv'') constantly held political demonstrations with the national yellow-and-blue flags waving above the heads of demonstrators.
+
+* On March 20, 1990, the town council of [[Ternopil]] voted upon the usage and re-establishment of the yellow-and-blue flag and the [[Coat of arms of Ukraine|''tryzub'']] as well as the national anthem ''[[Ukraine's glory has not perished|Shche ne vmerla Ukrainy]]''. On the same day, the yellow-and-blue national flag was flown for the first time in about 80 years on a governmental building in Kiev, replacing the then official [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR|red-and-blue flag]] of the Ukrainian SSR.
+
+* On April 28, 1990, the oblast council (''oblasna rada'') of [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]] also allowed the use of the national symbols of Ukraine within the Oblast.
+
+* On April 29, 1990, the yellow-and-blue flag was flown from the Ternopil city theater's flagstaff without the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|official flag of the Soviet Union]] hanging above it.
+
+* After July 24, 1990, the yellow-and-blue flag was flown for the first time over an official governmental building of the [[Kiev City Council]] on the ''[[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]]'' square of the ''[[Khreschatyk]]'' street.
+
+* After the declaration of independence of Ukraine on August 24, 1991, the national yellow-and-blue flag flew for the first time over the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament (''Verkhovna Rada'')]] building on September 4, 1991.

 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as we know it today.
 
 In the late 19th century, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was much more tolerant toward the Ukrainian national movement than the Russian Empire. A lot of literary work was done there, thus spreading the idea to the rest of Ukraine.

 Yellow–blue, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry color banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between 16–18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their [[hetman]]'s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In fact, the coat of arms of [[Lviv]] to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.
 
 Some put the starting point of the current national flag of Ukraine in year 1848, when during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] a yellow and blue banner flew over the Lviv magistrate for the first time. Although this move did not have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used yellow and blue banners in their insignia.

 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as we know it today.
 
 In the late 19th century, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was much more tolerant toward the Ukrainian national movement than the Russian Empire. A lot of literary work was done there, thus spreading the idea to the rest of Ukraine.

 The national '''[[flag]] of [[Ukraine]]''' ({{lang-uk|державний прапор України}}; [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]]: ''derzhavnyy prapor Ukrayiny''; literally ‘state flag of Ukraine’) was officially adopted for the first time in 1918 by a short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].  At that time the commonly used yellow–blue flag had already turned into blue and yellow and sported a trident (''[[tryzub]]'') in the upper left corner. The insignia remained unchanged by the [[Ukrainian State|successive government]] of [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]], and then by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, [[Bolsheviks]] had been using red and later red-blue flags as the official [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR|flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. The blue and yellow flag was officially restored in 1992 following Ukrainian independence.

 The national '''[[flag]] of [[Ukraine]]''' ({{lang-uk|державний прапор України}}; [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]]: ''derzhavnyy prapor Ukrayiny''; literally ‘state flag of Ukraine’) was officially adopted for the first time in 1918 by a short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].  At that time the commonly used yellow–blue flag had already turned into blue and yellow and sported a trident (''[[tryzub]]'') in the upper left corner. The insignia remained unchanged by the [[Ukrainian State|successive government]] of [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]], and then by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, [[Bolsheviks]] had been using red and later red-blue flags as the official [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR|flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. The blue and yellow flag was officially restored in 1992 following Ukrainian independence.

-Yellow–blue, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry color banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between the 16th and 18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their [[hetman]]'s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In fact, the coat of arms of [[Lviv]] to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.

 Some put the starting point of the current national flag of Ukraine in year 1848, when during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] a yellow and blue banner flew over the Lviv magistrate for the first time. Although this move did not have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used yellow and blue banners in their insignia.
 
-It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as it is known today.

The [[Free Territory|anarchist free-soviets]] that existed during the [[Ukrainian War of Independence|civil war]] used the black flag.

 Some put the starting point of the current national flag of Ukraine in year 1848, when during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] a yellow and blue banner flew over the Lviv magistrate for the first time. Although this move did not have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used yellow and blue banners in their insignia.
 
-It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language. Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be appealing to a common person. The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, and, although it has nothing to do with the choice of colours and the history of the original yellow and blue banner, it certainly formed the flag as it is known today.

Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue, and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be more appealing to the common person.

 The '''state flag of [[Ukraine]]''' ({{lang-uk|державний прапор України}}; [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]]: ''derzhavnyy prapor Ukrayiny''; literally ‘state flag of Ukraine’) is a banner of two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow colour.

-As a [[national flag]], the blue and yellow bicolor was officially used since the 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] when it was hoisted over the Lviv Rathaus.

 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language.{{cn|date=January 2014}} Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue,{{cn|date=January 2014}} and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be more appealing to the common person.{{cn|date=January 2014}} The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time,{{cn|date=January 2014}} and, although this evocation of a Ukrainian landscape has nothing to do with the choice of colours or the history of the original yellow and blue, it certainly has formed the Ukrainians' conception of their flag.{{cn|date=January 2014}}
 
-There is a popular interpretation of the meaning of the colors of the Ukrainian flag according to which the color blue represents the color of the sky, and the yellow symbolizes the lush golden wheat fields of this country. This association is thought to have been developed in the mid-19th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} However, this interpretation is but a poetic metaphor{{by whom|date=January 2014}} due to the fact that in the UNR in 1917, and sometimes later, the yellow-top and blue-bottom flag was used.

The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified<!-- (commented out until supporting evidence can be found), although a ratio of 5:2 is the most common-->.

 ===Origin===
-Some of the theories{{which|date=January 2014}} said that Ukrainian flag was given by the [[Silesia]]n knight{{cn|date=January 2014}} from the city of [[Opole]]—[[Władysław Opolczyk]], Hungarian governor of [[Galicia–Volhynia]]. It has the same colours as the flag of [[Opole]].

 === yellow-blue vs blue-yellow ===
 Interestingly, Ukrainians commonly refer to the flag as '''yellow and light blue''' (жовто-блакитний, ''zhovto-blakytnyi'')<ref>A little less often is used also ""yellow and blue"", ""blue and yellow"" and ""yellow and azure"".</ref> — a different version of the flag used during UNR ([[Ukrainian National Republic]]) years (1917–1921) with yellow on the top and blue on the bottom. The yellow on the top represents golden domes ([[cupola]]s) of Christian churches and the blue the [[Dnieper]] river.
 
-It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language.{{cn|date=January 2014}} Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue,{{cn|date=January 2014}} and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be more appealing to the common person.{{cn|date=January 2014}} The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time,{{cn|date=January 2014}} and, although this evocation of a Ukrainian landscape has nothing to do with the choice of colours or the history of the original yellow and blue, it certainly has formed the Ukrainians' conception of their flag.{{cn|date=January 2014}}

 The head of the [[Ukrainian Heraldry Society]], [[Andriy Grechylo]] points to the fact that the discussion about order of colors was taking place as far back as 1918.<ref name=grechylo>[http://gazeta.ua/articles/history/_hruschov-i-kaganovich-boyalisya-slova-zhovto-blakitnij/512859#photo-3 Khrushchev and Kaganovich were afraid of the word ""zhovto-blakytnyi"" (Хрущов і Каганович боялися слова ""жовто-блакитний"")].

-Already in the 1918 draft of Constitution of the [[Ukrainian National Republic]] the order of colors was defined as blue and yellow.<ref name=grechylo/> The same order could be found in legislative acts of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] for November of 1918 and the [[Carpathian Ukraine]] on March 15, 1939.<ref name=grechylo/> The argument on the order of colors was taking place in the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] as well.<ref name=grechylo/> In 1949 it was decided that until in Ukraine it would not be defined a single state flag, the diaspora will be using the blue-and-yellow banner.<ref name=grechylo/>

It is was officially adopted as a state flag for the first time in 1918 by the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation, the flag was outlawed and before 1949 there was no official state flag until adoption of the red-blue [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR|flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. People who were hoisting the blue-yellow flags in the Soviet Ukraine were prosecuted as criminals.

 ===Return of the national flag===
-Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national identity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian SSR (1940–1941 and 1944–1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's historic coat of arms as the state symbol.

 [[File:Hanging flag ukraine.jpg|thumb|upright=0.25|Hanging flag]]
 In addition to the normal horizontal format, many public buildings in Ukraine use vertical flags. Most town halls fly their town flag together with the national flag in this way; some town flags in Ukraine exist only in vertical form. The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified<!-- (commented out until supporting evidence can be found), although a ratio of 5:2 is the most common-->. When hung like a banner or draped, the blue band should be on the left, as illustrated. When flown from a vertical flagpole, the blue band must face the mast.

 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be more appealing to the common person.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and, although this evocation of a Ukrainian landscape has nothing to do with the choice of colours or the history of the original yellow and blue, it certainly has formed the Ukrainians' conception of their flag.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

 23 August is celebrated as the Day of the National Flag in Ukraine; beginning with 2004. July 24 was previously marked as National Flag Day in Kiev. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kiev City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on August 24. Following goverment decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays. Not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]]  in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered.

 The first flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on March 10, 1919, to serve as the symbol of state of the Ukrainian SSR. Details of the official flag changed periodically before the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but all were based on the red flag of the Bolshevik Revolution.
 The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (USSR, acronym for Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika in the Russian language). In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р. (URSR, for Ukrayins’ka Radyans’ka Sotsialistychna Respublika in the Ukrainian language).

 Interestingly, Ukrainians commonly refer to the flag as '''yellow and light blue''' (жовто-блакитний, ''zhovto-blakytnyi'')<ref>A little less often is used also ""yellow and blue"", ""blue and yellow"" and ""yellow and azure"".</ref>—a different version of the flag used during UNR ([[Ukrainian National Republic]]) years (1917–1921) with yellow on the top and blue on the bottom.

 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be more appealing to the common person.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and, although this evocation of a Ukrainian landscape has nothing to do with the choice of colours or the history of the original yellow and blue, it certainly has formed the Ukrainians' conception of their flag.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

+[[File:Flag of Ukrainian SSR.svg|thumb|[[File:FIAV historical.svg|23x15px]] Flag of the Ukrainian SSR (1949–91)]]
 The first flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on March 10, 1919, to serve as the symbol of state of the Ukrainian SSR. Details of the official flag changed periodically before the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but all were based on the red flag of the Bolshevik Revolution.
 The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (USSR, acronym for Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika in the Russian language). In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р. (URSR, for Ukrayins’ka Radyans’ka Sotsialistychna Respublika in the Ukrainian language).

 The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organization which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time interwar Poland). For long time OUN did not officially have its own flag, however during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the Carpathian Ukraine in 1938, Carpathian Sich, a militarized wing of OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem - golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalized and officially adopted by the organization only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
 
 The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942,[1] day of Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colors of the flag symbolize 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kiev City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on August 24. Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays. Not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]]  in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).

(URSR, for Ukrayins’ka Radyans’ka Sotsialistychna Respublika in the Ukrainian language).

+The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organization which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time interwar Poland). For long time OUN did not officially have its own flag, however during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the Carpathian Ukraine in 1938, Carpathian Sich, a militarized wing of OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem - golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalized and officially adopted by the organization only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
+
+The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942,[1] day of Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colors of the flag symbolize 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

 ===Return of the national flag===
 Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national identity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940–1941 and 1944–1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's historic coat of arms as the state symbol. The Parliaments of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] soon followed.

The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kiev City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on August 24. Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays. Not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]]  in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).

The flag was finalised and officially adopted by the organization only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
 
-The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942,[1] day of Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colors of the flag symbolize 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be more appealing to the common person.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and, although this evocation of a Ukrainian landscape has nothing to do with the choice of colours or the history of the original yellow and blue, it certainly has formed the Ukrainians' conception of their flag.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

 23 August is celebrated as the Day of the National Flag in Ukraine; beginning with 2004. July 24 was previously marked as National Flag Day in Kiev. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kiev City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on August 24. Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays. Not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]]  in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).

 23 August is celebrated as the Day of the National Flag in Ukraine; beginning with 2004. July 24 was previously marked as National Flag Day in Kiev. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kiev City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on August 24. Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays. Not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]]  in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).

-The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time interwar Poland). For long time OUN did not officially have its own flag, however during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the Carpathian Ukraine in 1938, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem - golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and officially adopted by the organisation only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
-
-The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942,[1] day of Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

For long time OUN did not officially have its own flag, however during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the Carpathian Ukraine in 1938, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem - golden nationalistic trident on a blue background.

+The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942,[1] day of Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

+===Return of the national flag===
+Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national identity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940–1941 and 1944–1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's historic coat of arms as the state symbol. The Parliaments of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] soon followed.
+
+The events in the Baltic countries soon led to similar processes in Ukraine. Particularly, West Ukraine and [[Ukrainian SSR]]'s capital [[Kiev]] (''Kyiv'') constantly held political demonstrations with the national yellow-and-blue flags waving above the heads of demonstrators.
+* On March 20, 1990, the town council of [[Ternopil]] voted upon the usage and re-establishment of the yellow-and-blue flag and the [[Coat of arms of Ukraine|''tryzub'']] as well as the national anthem ''[[Ukraine's glory has not perished|Shche ne vmerla Ukrainy]]''. On the same day, the yellow-and-blue national flag was flown for the first time in about 80 years on a governmental building in Kiev, replacing the then official [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR|red-and-blue flag]] of the Ukrainian SSR.
+* On April 28, 1990, the oblast council (''oblasna rada'') of [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]] also allowed the use of the national symbols of Ukraine within the Oblast.
+* On April 29, 1990, the yellow-and-blue flag was flown from the Ternopil city theater's flagstaff without the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|official flag of the Soviet Union]] hanging above it.
+* After July 24, 1990, the yellow-and-blue flag was flown for the first time over an official governmental building of the [[Kiev City Council]] on the ''[[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]]'' square of the ''[[Khreschatyk]]'' street.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ukrainian/politics/2012/07/120724_flag_ukraine_history_kyiv_as.shtml Twenty two years ago in Kiev officially was raised the blue-yellow flag (22 роки тому в Києві офіційно підняли синьо-жовтий прапор)]. BBC Ukraine. July 24, 2012.</ref>

 23 August is celebrated as the Day of the National Flag in Ukraine; beginning with 2004. July 24 was previously marked as National Flag Day in Kiev. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kiev City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on August 24. Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays. Not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]]  in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).

 The first flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on March 10, 1919, to serve as the symbol of state of the Ukrainian SSR. Details of the official flag changed periodically before the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but all were based on the red flag of the Bolshevik Revolution.
 The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (USSR, acronym for Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika in the Russian language). In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р.

 The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time interwar Poland). For long time OUN did not officially have its own flag, however during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the Carpathian Ukraine in 1938, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem - golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and officially adopted by the organisation only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
 ",/* Postwar Ukraine */,188.163.93.29,2014-11-13T22:59:18Z,"**Change Description:** Added a flag gallery for the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, including multiple flags and their captions.

**Analysis:** The addition of the flag gallery emphasizes the symbols associated with the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, which can be interpreted as an attempt to promote a specific nationalistic narrative. The inclusion of these flags may serve to reinforce a particular identity and historical perspective that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of ongoing conflicts.

**Conclusion:** Weaponised. The change highlights nationalistic symbols that can be used to assert cultural identity in a politically charged environment.",Weaponised

 In addition to the normal horizontal format, many public buildings, such as [[Verkhovna rada]] in Ukraine use vertical flags. Most town halls fly their town flag together with the national flag in this way; some town flags in Ukraine exist only in vertical form. The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified<!-- (commented out until supporting evidence can be found), although a ratio of 5:2 is the most common-->. When hung like a banner or draped, the blue band should be on the left, as illustrated. When flown from a vertical flagpole, the blue band must face the mast.

Since that time the flag has frequently appeared on stamps.

+===Decoration===
+Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with golden [[Fringe (trim)|fringe]] surrounding the perimeter of the flag as long as it does not deface the flag proper.

+
+===Display at half-staff===
+The flag is displayed at half-staff (half-mast in naval usage) as a sign of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president. Half-mast means the flag is flown two-thirds of the way up the flagpole with at least the height of the flag between the top of the flag and the top of the flagpole.

 The first flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on March 10, 1919, to serve as the symbol of state of the Ukrainian SSR. Details of the official flag changed periodically before the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but all were based on the red flag of the Bolshevik Revolution.
 The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (USSR, acronym for Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika in the Russian language). In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р. (URSR, for Ukrayins’ka Radyans’ka Sotsialistychna Respublika in the Ukrainian language).

 As a [[national flag]], the blue and yellow bicolour was officially used since the 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] when it was hoisted over the [[Lviv Town Hall|Lviv Rathaus]]. It was officially adopted as a state flag for the first time in 1918 by the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. When Ukraine was part of the [[Soviet Union]], the flag was outlawed and before 1949 there was no official state flag until adoption of the red-blue [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR|flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. People who were hoisting the blue-yellow flags in the Soviet Ukraine were prosecuted as criminals. The blue and yellow flag was provisionally adopted for official ceremonies in September 1991 following Ukrainian independence, before finally officially being restored in 1992.

 The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time interwar Poland). For long time OUN did not officially have its own flag, however during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the Carpathian Ukraine in 1938, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem - golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and officially adopted by the organisation only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
 
 The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942,[1] day of Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement.

The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kiev City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on August 24. Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays. Not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]]  in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).

 23 August is celebrated as the Day of the National Flag in Ukraine; beginning with 2004. July 24 was previously marked as National Flag Day in Kiev. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kiev City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on August 24. Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays. Not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]]  in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).

In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р.

This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union.

 Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national identity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.

 The '''state flag of [[Ukraine]]''' ({{lang-uk|державний прапор України}}; [[Romanisation of Ukrainian|translit.]]: ''derzhavnyy prapor Ukrayiny''; literally 'state flag of Ukraine') is a banner of two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 20|Article 20]]).
 
 As a [[national flag]], the blue and yellow bicolour was officially used since the 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] when it was hoisted over the [[Lviv Town Hall|Lviv Rathaus]]. It was officially adopted as a state flag for the first time in 1918 by the short-lived [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], and subsequently used by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. When Ukraine was part of the [[Soviet Union]], the flag was outlawed and before 1949 there was no official state flag until adoption of the red-blue [[Flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. People who hoisted the blue-yellow flags in the Soviet Ukraine were prosecuted as criminals{{citation needed|reason=sounds like an urban legend|date=August 2016}}.

 The '''state flag of [[Ukraine]]''' ({{lang-uk|державний прапор України}}; [[Romanisation of Ukrainian|translit.]]: ''derzhavnyy prapor Ukrayiny''; literally 'state flag of Ukraine') is a banner of two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 20|Article 20]]).
 
-As a [[national flag]], the blue and yellow bicolour was officially used since the 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] when it was hoisted over the [[Lviv Town Hall|Lviv Rathaus]]. It was officially adopted as a state flag for the first time in 1918 by the short-lived [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], and subsequently used by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. When Ukraine was part of the [[Soviet Union]], the flag was outlawed and before 1949 there was no official state flag until adoption of the red-blue [[Flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. People who hoisted the blue-yellow flags in the Soviet Ukraine were prosecuted as criminals. The blue and yellow flag was provisionally adopted for official ceremonies in September 1991 following Ukrainian independence, before finally officially being restored in 1992.

 The first flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on March 10, 1919, to serve as the symbol of state of the [[Soviet Ukraine]]. Details of the official flag changed periodically before the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but all were based on the red flag of the [[October Revolution]] in Russia and an exact replica of the [[Soviet Russia]].
 The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (USSR, acronym for Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika in the Russian language). In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р.

 August 23 is celebrated as the Day of the National Flag in Ukraine; beginning with 2004. July 24 was previously marked as National Flag Day in Kiev. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on July 24, 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kiev City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on August 24. Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays. Not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]]  in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).",it is called Kiev in English,Toddy1,2017-01-02T20:19:25Z,"Changed ""Kyiv"" to ""Kiev"" in the context of a flag display at City Hall.

 The roots of Ukrainian national symbols come from before Christian times when yellow and blue prevailed in traditional ceremonies, reflecting fire and water.<ref name=Saprykov>[http://geraldika.ru/symbols/3334 Geraldika.ru Флаг Украины]</ref> The most solid proof of yellow and blue colours could be traced as far as the [[Battle of Grunwald]] at which participated militia formations from various lands of the Polish-Lithuanian Union.
 
 Yellow–blue, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry colour banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between the 16th and 18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their [[hetman]]'s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In fact, the coat of arms of [[Lviv]] to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.
 
 Some put the starting point of the current national flag of Ukraine in year 1848, when during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] a yellow and blue banner was adopted by the [[Main Ruthenian Council]]<ref name=istpravda>[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2014/01/14/140850/ Blue-yellow or yellow-blue?

 Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with a [[gold (color)|golden]] [[Fringe (trim)|fringe]] surrounding the perimeter of the flag, as long as it does not deface the flag proper. The beginning of this tradition was the [[flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' shows a flag decorated with a gold star. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on indoor posts, often use a fringe to enhance the beauty of the flag. No specific law governs the legality of this fringe.

 The first flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on March 10, 1919, to serve as the symbol of state of the [[Soviet Ukraine]]. Details of the official flag changed periodically before the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but all were based on the red flag of the [[October Revolution]] in Russia and an exact replica of the [[Soviet Russia]].
 The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (USSR, acronym for Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika in the Russian language). In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р. (URSR, for Ukrayins’ka Radyans’ka Sotsialistychna Respublika in the Ukrainian language).

-The [[Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists]] is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]]). For long time OUN did not officially have its own flag, however during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the Carpathian Ukraine in 1938, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem – golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and officially adopted by the organisation only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.

-The [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during [[World War II]] against [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and both [[Home Army|Underground]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Communist Poland]]. The group was the military wing of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists#Split in the OUN|Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction]] (the OUN-B), originally formed in [[Volyn]] in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is October 14, 1942, day of Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

 The first flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on March 10, 1919, to serve as the symbol of state of the [[Soviet Ukraine]]. Details of the official flag changed periodically before the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but all were based on the red flag of the [[October Revolution]] in Russia and an exact replica of the [[Soviet Russia]].
 The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (USSR, acronym for Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika in the Russian language). In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р. (URSR, for Ukrayins’ka Radyans’ka Sotsialistychna Respublika in the Ukrainian language).

**Analysis:** The revision emphasizes the historical significance of the blue-yellow coloring in relation to Ukraine's national identity and heritage, specifically linking it to Kyivan Ruthenia and the national coat of arms. This framing can be seen as reinforcing a narrative of cultural pride and historical legitimacy.

**Conclusion:** Weaponised. The revision subtly enhances the narrative of Ukrainian cultural heritage, which can be used to assert national identity in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.",Weaponised

 Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national identity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940–1941 and 1944–1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's historic coat of arms as the state symbol. The Parliaments of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] soon followed.
 
 The events in the Baltic countries soon led to similar processes in Ukraine. Particularly, West Ukraine and [[Ukrainian SSR]]'s capital [[Kiev]] (''Kyiv'') constantly held political demonstrations with the national yellow-and-blue flags waving above the heads of demonstrators.

 ===Interbellum Ukraine===
 The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time interwar Poland). For long time OUN did not officially have its own flag, however during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the Carpathian Ukraine in 1938, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem – golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and officially adopted by the organisation only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
 
-The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is October 14, 1942,[1] day of Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р.

In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р.

 ===Interbellum Ukraine===
 The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time interwar Poland). For long time OUN did not officially have its own flag, however during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the Carpathian Ukraine in 1938, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem – golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and officially adopted by the organisation only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
 
-The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942, day of Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

 The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is October 14, 1942,[1] day of Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

 Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national identity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940–1941 and 1944–1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's historic coat of arms as the state symbol. The Parliaments of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] soon followed.
 
 The events in the Baltic countries soon led to similar processes in Ukraine. Particularly, West Ukraine and [[Ukrainian SSR]]'s capital [[Kiev]] (''Kyiv'') constantly held political demonstrations with the national yellow-and-blue flags waving above the heads of demonstrators.

 ===Soviet Ukraine: 1922–1991===
 {{Main|Flag of the Ukrainian SSR}}
 The first flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on March 10, 1919, to serve as the symbol of state of the [[Soviet Ukraine]]. Details of the official flag changed periodically before the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but all were based on the red flag of the [[October Revolution]] in Russia and an exact replica of the [[Soviet Russia]].
 The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (USSR, acronym for Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika in the Russian language). In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р. (URSR, for Ukrayins’ka Radyans’ka Sotsialistychna Respublika in the Ukrainian language).

 ===Interbellum Ukraine===
 The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time interwar Poland). For long time OUN did not officially have its own flag, however during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the Carpathian Ukraine in 1938, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem – golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and officially adopted by the organisation only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
 
 The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is October 14, 1942,[1] day of Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

-August 23 is celebrated as the Day of the National Flag in Ukraine; beginning with 2004. July 24 was previously marked as National Flag Day in Kiev. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on July 24, 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kiev City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on August 24. Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays. Not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]]  in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered.

The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on July 24, 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kiev City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on 24 August. Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays. Not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]]  in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).

 The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (USSR, acronym for Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika in the Russian language). In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р. (URSR, for Ukrayins’ka Radyans’ka Sotsialistychna Respublika in the Ukrainian language).

 The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is October 14, 1942,[1] day of Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

 The '''flag of [[Ukraine]]''' is a banner of two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 20|Article 20]]).
 
-The flag of [[Ukraine]] is a combination of two colors where the top represents the sky and the yellow represents the wheat. The combination of blue and yellow as a symbol of Ukrainian lands comes from the flag of the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]] used in the 12th century. As a [[national flag]], the blue and yellow bicolour has been officially used since the 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]], when it was hoisted over the [[Lviv Town Hall|Lviv Rathaus]]. It was officially adopted as a state flag for the first time in 1918 by the short-lived [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] and subsequently used by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. When Ukraine was part of the [[Soviet Union]], the flag was outlawed and, before 1949, there was no official state flag until adoption of the red-azure [[Flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. The blue and yellow flag was provisionally adopted for official ceremonies in September 1991 following [[Modern_history_of_Ukraine#Independent_Ukraine_(1991_to_present) |Ukrainian independence]], before finally officially being restored on 28 January 1992 by the [[parliament of Ukraine]].<ref>[http://www.unian.info/society/1747301-ukraines-national-flag-celebrating-25th-anniversary-today.html Ukraine’s national flag celebrating 25th anniversary today], [[UNIAN]] (28 January 2017)</ref><ref name=""Symbolsx2"">{{cite news|last=Trach|first=Nataliya|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/the-story-behind-2-top-ukrainian-symbols-national-flag-and-trident-421675.html|title=The story behind 2 top Ukrainian symbols: National flag and trident|publisher=Kyiv Post|date=26 August 2016|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref>

 ===Origin===
-One claimed version is that since the one of first known colour depictions of Kyiv Coat of Arms was mainly in yellow-blue colours, which may presume, that this tradition was held since nordic-slavic from his origins Volodymyr, the Great Konung of Kyiv and earlier (Great Prince, after adoption of Byzantium Christianity).

 23 August is celebrated as the Day of the National Flag in Ukraine; beginning with 2004. 24 July was previously marked as National Flag Day in Kiev. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on July 24, 1990 at the flagstaff of the Kiev City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992 Independence Day of Ukraine is celebrated on 24 August. Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays. Not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]]  in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).",/* Flag Day */,TheHistoryBuff101,2020-01-15T03:38:48Z,"Changed the description of the image from ""Flag at [[Kiev]] City Hall"" to ""The flag of Ukraine at [[Kiev]] City Hall"".

 The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (USSR, acronym for Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika in the Russian language). In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р.

Details of the official flag changed periodically before the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but all were based on the red flag of the [[October Revolution]] in Russia and an exact replica of the [[Soviet Russia]].
 The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (USSR, acronym for Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika in the Russian language). In the 1930s a gold border was added. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif letters У.Р.С.Р. (URSR, for Ukrayins’ka Radyans’ka Sotsialistychna Respublika in the Ukrainian language).

 Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national identity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940–1941 and 1944–1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's historic coat of arms as the state symbol.

-The '''flag of [[Ukraine]]''' is a banner of two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 20|Article 20]]). The top represents sky and the yellow represents wheat. The combination of blue and yellow as a symbol of Ukrainian lands comes from the flag of the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]] used in the 12th century. As a [[national flag]], the blue and yellow bicolour has been officially used since the 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]], when it was hoisted over the [[Lviv Town Hall|Lviv Rathaus]].

 The '''flag of [[Ukraine]]''' is a banner of two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 20|Article 20]]). The top represents sky and the yellow represents wheat. The combination of blue and yellow as a symbol of Ukrainian lands comes from the flag of the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]] used in the 12th century. As a [[national flag]], the blue and yellow bicolour has been officially used since the 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]], when it was hoisted over the [[Lviv Town Hall|Lviv Rathaus]]. It was officially adopted as a state flag for the first time in 1918 by the short-lived [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] and subsequently used by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. When Ukraine was part of the [[Soviet Union]], the flag was outlawed and, before 1949, there was no official state flag until adoption of the red-azure [[Flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. The blue and yellow flag was provisionally adopted for official ceremonies in September 1991 following [[Modern history of Ukraine#Independent Ukraine (1991 to present)|Ukrainian independence]], before finally officially being restored on 28 January 1992 by the [[parliament of Ukraine]].<ref>[http://www.unian.info/society/1747301-ukraines-national-flag-celebrating-25th-anniversary-today.html Ukraine’s national flag celebrating 25th anniversary today], [[UNIAN]] (28 January 2017)</ref><ref name=""Symbolsx2"">{{cite news|last=Trach|first=Nataliya|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/the-story-behind-2-top-ukrainian-symbols-national-flag-and-trident-421675.html|title=The story behind 2 top Ukrainian symbols: National flag and trident|publisher=Kyiv Post|date=26 August 2016|access-date=27 August 2016}}</ref>

 Yellow–blue, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry colour banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between the 16th and 18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their [[hetman]]'s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In fact, the coat of arms of [[Lviv]] to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.

 One claimed version is that since the one of first known colour depictions of Kyiv Coat of Arms was mainly in yellow-blue colours, which may presume, that this tradition was held since Nordic-Slavic from his origins Volodymyr, the Great Konung of Kyiv and earlier (Great Prince, after adoption of Byzantium Christianity). At least, when Poltava battle was held, Cossacks of Mazepa were struggling under the yellow-blue banners, while their Swedish allies – under yellow ones.
 
 In reality, however, the blue-yellow coloring dates back to Kyivan Ruthenia, as an early version of the Tryzub, Ukraine's national coat of arms, sported the same coloring as the seal for Sviatoslav I of Kyiv (c. AD 945).

 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the spoken language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the upper band) and yellow (the lower band). The issue is quite significant, because the historical alteration of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Back in 1848, the flag was yellow and blue,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and it was later changed to blue and yellow to be more appealing to the common person.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} A common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, as Ukraine is considered Europe's breadbasket, or ""blue sky over sunflowers,"" which is their national flower {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. Although this evocation of a Ukrainian landscape has nothing to do with the choice of colours or the history of the original yellow and blue, it certainly has formed the Ukrainians' conception of their flag.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The sunflower analogy with the flag became popular due to a viral video featuring a woman standing up to a Russian soldier during the [[Russo-Ukrainian War]], when she told him to put sunflower seeds in his pocket so sunflowers will grow when he dies on their soil.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-russia-soldier-woman-confrontation-b2022993.html</ref>

-The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time interwar Poland). For long time OUN did not officially have its own flag; however, during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the [[Republic of Carpathian Ukraine]] in 1939, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem – golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and officially adopted by the organisation only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.

-The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is October 14, 1942,[1] day of Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

 Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national identity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.

 The [[national flag]] of [[Ukraine]] has two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 20|Article 20]]). The combination of blue and yellow as a symbol of Ukrainian lands comes from the flag of the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]] used in the 12th century. As a [[national flag]], the blue and yellow bicolour has been officially used since the 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]], when it was hoisted over the [[Lviv Town Hall|Lviv Rathaus]]. It was officially adopted as a state flag for the first time in 1918 by the short-lived [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] and subsequently used by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. When Ukraine was part of the [[Soviet Union]], the flag was outlawed and, before 1949, there was no official state flag until the adoption of the red-azure [[Flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. The blue and yellow flag was provisionally adopted for official ceremonies in September 1991 following [[Modern history of Ukraine#Independent Ukraine (1991 to present)|Ukrainian independence]], before finally officially being restored on 28 January 1992 by the [[parliament of Ukraine]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ukraine’s national flag celebrating 25th anniversary today|url=https://www.unian.info/society/1747301-ukraines-national-flag-celebrating-25th-anniversary-today.html|access-date=2022-03-04|website=[[UNIAN]]|language=en}}</ref><ref name=""Symbolsx2"">{{cite news|last=Trach|first=Nataliya|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/the-story-behind-2-top-ukrainian-symbols-national-flag-and-trident-421675.html|title=The story behind 2 top Ukrainian symbols: National flag and trident|publisher=Kyiv Post|date=26 August 2016|access-date=27 August 2016}}</ref>

 Yellow–blue, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry colour banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between the 16th and 18th centuries.

The issue is quite significant, because the historical alteration of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Back in 1848, the flag was yellow and blue,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and it was later changed to blue and yellow to be more appealing to the common person.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} A common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, as Ukraine is considered Europe's breadbasket, or ""blue sky over sunflowers,"" which is their national flower {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. Although this evocation of a Ukrainian landscape has nothing to do with the choice of colours or the history of the original yellow and blue, it has formed the Ukrainians' conception of their flag.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

-The [[national flag]] of [[Ukraine]] has two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 20|Article 20]]).

 ===Interbellum Ukraine===
 The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time interwar Poland). For a long time, the OUN did not officially have its own flag; however, during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the [[Republic of Carpathian Ukraine]] in 1939, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of the OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem – a golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and officially adopted by the organisation only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
 
-The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October  1942. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

 It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the spoken language as ""yellow and light blue"", the current flag in reality is blue (the upper band) and yellow (the lower band). The issue is quite significant, because the historical alteration of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Back in 1848, the flag was yellow and blue,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and it was later changed to blue and yellow to be more appealing to the common person.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} A common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time, as Ukraine is considered Europe's breadbasket, or ""blue sky over sunflowers,"" which is their national flower {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}.

-One claimed version is that, since one of the first known coloured depictions of the Coat of Arms of Kyiv was mainly in yellow-blue colours, this tradition may have existed since the time of the Nordic-Slavic [[Grand Prince of Kyiv]] [[Volodymyr the Great]]. However, the blue-yellow colouring dates back to [[Kyivan Ruthenia]], as an early version of the ''[[Tryzub]]'', Ukraine's national coat of arms, sported the same colouring as the seal of [[Sviatoslav I]] of Kyiv (c. AD 945). During the 1709 [[Battle of Poltava]], the Cossacks under [[Mazepa]] fought under the yellow-blue banners, while their Swedish allies were under yellow ones.

 ===Interbellum Ukraine===
 The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time interwar Poland). For a long time, the OUN did not officially have its own flag; however, during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the [[Republic of Carpathian Ukraine]] in 1939, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of the OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem – a golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and officially adopted by the organisation only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
 
-The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is October 14, 1942, during the day of the Intercession of the Theotokos feast. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October  1942. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

-One claimed version is that, since one of the first known colored depictions of the Coat of Arms of Kyiv was mainly in yellow-blue colors, this tradition may have existed since the time of the Nordic-Slavic [[Grand Prince of Kyiv]] [[Volodymyr the Great]]. At least, during the Battle of Poltava, the Cossacks under [[Mazepa]] fought under the yellow-blue banners, while their Swedish allies under yellow ones.
-
-In reality, however, the blue-yellow coloring dates back to [[Kyivan Ruthenia]], as an early version of the [[Tryzub]], Ukraine's national coat of arms, sported the same coloring as the seal of Sviatoslav I of Kyiv (c. AD 945).

-It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the spoken language as ""yellow and light blue"", the current flag in reality is blue (the upper band) and yellow (the lower band).

 Throughout the history of [[Ukraine]], various [[List of heads of state of Ukraine|heads of state]] have used different flags. The designs differ according to the historical era they were used in and in accordance with the political scene in [[Ukraine]] at the time. The first flag to be used by a [[List of heads of state of Ukraine|head of state of Ukraine]] was that of [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]]. The current design, the flag of the [[President of Ukraine]], was adopted in 1991.

AD 945). During the 1709 [[Battle of Poltava]], the Cossacks following [[Mazepa]] fought under yellow-blue banners, while their Swedish allies were under yellow ones.

 The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time interwar Poland). For a long time, the OUN did not officially have its own flag; however, during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the [[Republic of Carpathian Ukraine]] in 1939, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of the OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem – a golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and officially adopted by the organisation only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
 
 The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.
+
+Between the period of 1941–1944, the flag of [[Nazi Germany]] was used to represent [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]], a civilian government under Nazi occupation.

 ===Interbellum and Reichskommissariat Ukraine===
 The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement originally was created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (at the time interwar Poland). For a long time, the OUN did not officially have its own flag; however, during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the [[Republic of Carpathian Ukraine]] in 1939, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of the OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem – a golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and officially adopted by the organisation only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
 
-The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both Underground and Communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

-
-===Legal status===
-
-Article 20 of the Constitution of Ukraine states the following, citing: ""the State Flag of Ukraine is a banner of two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow colour."" ({{lang-uk|""Державний Прапор України — стяг із двох рівновеликих горизонтальних смуг синього і жовтого кольорів.""}}).<ref name=""constitution_article"">{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine|title=Constitution of Ukraine}}</ref><ref name=constitution_official_uk>{{cite web |url=http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/254%D0%BA/96-%D0%B2%D1%80 |script-title=uk:Конституція України |language=uk |website=Верховна Рада України}}</ref>
-
-===Vertical flags===
-[[File:Hanging flag of Ukraine.svg|thumb|upright=0.25|Hanging version of the Ukrainian flag]]
-
-In addition to the normal horizontal format, many public buildings, such as the [[Verkhovna Rada]], use vertical flags. Most town halls fly their town flag together with the national flag in this way; some town flags in Ukraine exist only in vertical form. The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified<!-- (commented out until supporting evidence can be found), although a ratio of 5:2 is the most common-->. When hung like a banner or draped, the blue band should be on the left. When flown from a vertical flagpole, the blue band must face the mast.
-
-===Stamps===
-[[File:Marka3.jpg|thumbnail|""Freedom for Ukraine"" cinderella stamp, featuring the Ukrainian flag with a gold fringe and a gold [[Coat of arms of Ukraine|coat of arms]] on top of the flag pole]]
-The flag did not appear on Ukrainian official postal stamp issues until 1992, when they depicted the flag with the state coat of arms. Since then the flag has frequently appeared on stamps. [[Cinderella stamp]]s of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] were printed outside Ukraine during the Soviet period and served patriotic purposes.
-
-===Decoration===
-Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with a [[gold (color)|golden]] [[Fringe (trim)|fringe]] surrounding the perimeter of the flag, as long as it does not deface the flag proper. The beginning of this tradition was the [[flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' shows a flag decorated with a gold star. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on indoor posts, often use a fringe to enhance the beauty of the flag. No specific law governs the legality of this fringe. Traditionally, the [[Ukrainian Ground Forces|Army]], [[National Guard of Ukraine|Guard]], [[Ukrainian Navy|Navy]] and [[Ukrainian Air Force|Air Force]] use a fringed flag for [[military parade|parades]], [[colour guard]]s and indoor displays, while the [[President of Ukraine|Office of the President]] and local authorities use a fringed flag for all purposes.
-
-===Places of continuous display===
-[[File:28160-Lviv.jpg|thumbnail|The Ukrainian flag flying on the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]] with the statue of Glory]]
-Ukrainian flags are customly displayed continuously at certain locations.
-* [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]], main square of [[Kyiv]], traditional place for political rallies, including for large-scale radical protest campaigns ([[Orange Revolution]] and [[Euromaidan]])
-* [[Presidential Administration Building (Kyiv)|Presidential Administration Building]], [[Verkhovna Rada building]] and [[Budynok Uryadu]]

-* At [[State Border Guard Service of Ukraine]] sites
-* National, regional and local government buildings
-* [[Diplomatic missions of Ukraine|Ukrainian embassies and consulates]]
-
-===Particular days for display===
-The flag should especially be displayed at full staff on the following days:
-* 1 January: [[New Year's Day]]
-* 7 January: [[Christmas#Date according to Julian calendar|Christmas (Julian)]]
-* 22 January: Ukrainian Unity Day

-* 24 August: Independence Day
-* 21 November: Day of Dignity and Freedom
-* 6 December: Armed Forces Day
-* 25 December: Christmas (Gregorian/Neo-Julian)
-
-===Display at half-staff===
-The flag is displayed at half-staff (half-mast in naval usage) as a sign of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president. Half-mast means the flag is flown two-thirds of the way up the flagpole with at least the height of the flag between the top of the flag and the top of the flagpole. Black ribbons indicate mourning on banners that can't be lowered to half-mast.
-* 4th Saturday of November: [[Holodomor Memorial Day]]

-==Flag Day==
-[[File:Ukrflagblue.jpg|thumbnail|right|The flag of Ukraine at [[Kyiv]] City Hall]]
-{{main|Day of the National Flag (Ukraine)}}
-
-23 August has been celebrated as the Day of the National Flag in Ukraine since 2004. 24 July was previously marked as National Flag Day in Kyiv. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990, at the flagstaff of the Kyiv City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992, the [[Independence Day of Ukraine]] is celebrated on 24 August. Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays; not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]] in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).

-The roots of Ukrainian national symbols come from pre-Christian times when yellow and blue prevailed in traditional ceremonies, reflecting fire and water.<ref name=Saprykov>{{cite web|url=http://geraldika.ru/symbols/3334|script-title=ru:Флаг Украины|trans-title=Flag of Ukraine|language=ru|first=V.|last=Saprykov|website=geraldika.ru|date=May 30, 2003|access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> The most solid proof of yellow and blue colours can be traced back as far as the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, in which militia formations from various lands of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] participated.
-
-Yellow–blue, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry colour banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between the 16th and 18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their [[hetman]]'s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In fact, the coat of arms of [[Lviv]] to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.
-
-Some put the starting point of the adoption of the current national flag of Ukraine to 1848 when, during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] on 22 April 1848, a yellow-and-blue banner was adopted by the [[Supreme Ruthenian Council]]<ref name=istpravda>{{Cite web|title=Синьо-жовтий чи жовто-блакитний?

 The official flag of [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]]'s [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]] also was light blue–yellow and became the same under the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] of [[Symon Petlura]]. The flag of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] was blue-yellow. The stateless [[Makhnovshchina]] (Free Territory), which existed during the [[Ukrainian War of Independence]], used the [[Anarchist_symbolism#Black_flag|black flag]].
 
 Among Ukrainian immigrant organisations, there were proponents of both blue–yellow and yellow–blue flags. Eventually, it was agreed to use the blue–yellow flag until the issue was resolved in the independent Ukraine.

 Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national identity, which led to the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940–1941 and 1944–1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's national flag and coat of arms as the state symbol.

 Ukrainians commonly refer to the flag as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy'')<ref>A little less often they use also ""yellow and blue"", ""blue and yellow"" and ""yellow and azure"".</ref>—a different version of the flag used during UNR ([[Ukrainian National Republic]]) years (1917–1921) with yellow on the top and blue on the bottom. The yellow on the top allegedly represents golden domes ([[cupola]]s) of Christian churches and the blue the [[Dnieper]] river.

+The flag is similar to that of the Austrian state of [[Lower Austria]], the German city of [[Chemnitz]], and the Hungarian city of [[Pécs]], but all of those flags have a darker shade of blue. The flag is also somewhat similar to that of the Malaysian state of [[Flag and coat of arms of Perlis|Perlis]], but has a reversed arrangement of colours with darker shades of blue and yellow as well as a different flag aspect ratio.

+Article 20 of the Constitution of Ukraine states the following, citing: ""the State Flag of Ukraine is a banner of two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow colour."" ({{lang-uk|""Державний Прапор України — стяг із двох рівновеликих горизонтальних смуг синього і жовтого кольорів.""}}).<ref name=""constitution_article"">{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine|title=Constitution of Ukraine}}</ref><ref name=constitution_official_uk>{{cite web |url=http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/254%D0%BA/96-%D0%B2%D1%80 |script-title=uk:Конституція України |language=uk |website=Верховна Рада України}}</ref>
+
+===Vertical flags===
+[[File:Hanging flag of Ukraine.svg|thumb|upright=0.25|Hanging version of the Ukrainian flag]]
+
+In addition to the normal horizontal format, many public buildings, such as the [[Verkhovna Rada]], use vertical flags. Most town halls fly their town flag together with the national flag in this way; some town flags in Ukraine exist only in vertical form. The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified<!-- (commented out until supporting evidence can be found), although a ratio of 5:2 is the most common-->. When hung like a banner or draped, the blue band should be on the left. When flown from a vertical flagpole, the blue band must face the mast.
+
+===Stamps===
+[[File:Marka3.jpg|thumbnail|""Freedom for Ukraine"" cinderella stamp, featuring the Ukrainian flag with a gold fringe and a gold [[Coat of arms of Ukraine|coat of arms]] on top of the flag pole]]
+The flag did not appear on Ukrainian official postal stamp issues until 1992, when they depicted the flag with the state coat of arms. Since then the flag has frequently appeared on stamps. [[Cinderella stamp]]s of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] were printed outside Ukraine during the Soviet period and served patriotic purposes.
+
+===Decoration===
+Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with a [[gold (color)|golden]] [[Fringe (trim)|fringe]] surrounding the perimeter of the flag, as long as it does not deface the flag proper. The beginning of this tradition was the [[flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' shows a flag decorated with a gold star. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on indoor posts, often use a fringe to enhance the beauty of the flag. No specific law governs the legality of this fringe. Traditionally, the [[Ukrainian Ground Forces|Army]], [[National Guard of Ukraine|Guard]], [[Ukrainian Navy|Navy]] and [[Ukrainian Air Force|Air Force]] use a fringed flag for [[military parade|parades]], [[colour guard]]s and indoor displays, while the [[President of Ukraine|Office of the President]] and local authorities use a fringed flag for all purposes.
+
+===Places of continuous display===
+[[File:28160-Lviv.jpg|thumbnail|The Ukrainian flag flying on the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]] with the statue of Glory]]
+Ukrainian flags are customly displayed continuously at certain locations.
+* [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]], main square of [[Kyiv]], traditional place for political rallies, including for large-scale radical protest campaigns ([[Orange Revolution]] and [[Euromaidan]])
+* [[Presidential Administration Building (Kyiv)|Presidential Administration Building]], [[Verkhovna Rada building]] and [[Budynok Uryadu]]
+* [[Kyiv City Council]]
+* [[Lviv High Castle]]
+* [[Vernadsky Research Base]]
+* At [[State Border Guard Service of Ukraine]] sites
+* National, regional and local government buildings
+* [[Diplomatic missions of Ukraine|Ukrainian embassies and consulates]]
+
+===Particular days for display===
+The flag should especially be displayed at full staff on the following days:
+* 1 January: [[New Year's Day]]
+* 7 January: [[Christmas#Date according to Julian calendar|Christmas (Julian)]]
+* 22 January: Ukrainian Unity Day
+* 8 March: International Women's Day

+* 23 August: Flag Day
+* 24 August: Independence Day
+* 21 November: Day of Dignity and Freedom
+* 6 December: Armed Forces Day
+* 25 December: Christmas (Gregorian/Neo-Julian)
+
+===Display at half-staff===
+The flag is displayed at half-staff (half-mast in naval usage) as a sign of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president. Half-mast means the flag is flown two-thirds of the way up the flagpole with at least the height of the flag between the top of the flag and the top of the flagpole. Black ribbons indicate mourning on banners that can't be lowered to half-mast.
+* 4th Saturday of November: [[Holodomor Memorial Day]]

+==Flag Day==
+[[File:Ukrflagblue.jpg|thumbnail|right|The flag of Ukraine at [[Kyiv]] City Hall]]
+{{main|Day of the National Flag (Ukraine)}}
+
+23 August has been celebrated as the Day of the National Flag in Ukraine since 2004. 24 July was previously marked as National Flag Day in Kyiv. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990, at the flagstaff of the Kyiv City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992, the [[Independence Day of Ukraine]] is celebrated on 24 August. Following government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this dates and some other holidays; not all of these days are public holidays. Flags also must be flown on election days for the [[Verkhovna Rada]] in addition to other regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are required to be flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).

+The roots of Ukrainian national symbols come from pre-Christian times when yellow and blue prevailed in traditional ceremonies, reflecting fire and water.<ref name=Saprykov>{{cite web|url=http://geraldika.ru/symbols/3334|script-title=ru:Флаг Украины|trans-title=Flag of Ukraine|language=ru|first=V.|last=Saprykov|website=geraldika.ru|date=May 30, 2003|access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> The most solid proof of yellow and blue colours can be traced back as far as the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, in which militia formations from various lands of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] participated.
+
+Yellow–blue, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry colour banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between the 16th and 18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their [[hetman]]'s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In fact, the coat of arms of [[Lviv]] to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.
+
+Some put the starting point of the adoption of the current national flag of Ukraine to 1848 when, during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] on 22 April 1848, a yellow-and-blue banner was adopted by the [[Supreme Ruthenian Council]]<ref name=istpravda>{{Cite web|title=Синьо-жовтий чи жовто-блакитний?

Although this move did not have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used yellow-and-blue banners in their insignia.

+During the [[Revolution of 1905|Russian Revolution of 1905]], this flag was used by Ukrainians of the [[Dnieper Ukraine]], or the Russian part of Ukraine.

 One claimed version is that, since one of the first known coloured depictions of the Coat of Arms of Kyiv was mainly in yellow-blue colours, this tradition may have existed since the time of the Nordic-Slavic [[Grand Prince of Kyiv]] [[Volodymyr the Great]]. However, the blue-yellow colouring dates back to [[Kievan Rus’]], as an early version of the ''[[Tryzub]]'', Ukraine's national coat of arms, sported the same colouring as the seal of [[Sviatoslav I]] of Kyiv (c. AD 945). During the 1709 [[Battle of Poltava]], the Cossacks following [[Mazepa]] fought under yellow-blue banners, while their Swedish allies were under yellow ones.

 The [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against [[Nazi Germany]], the Soviet Union, [[Czechoslovakia]], and both underground and [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]]. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

-The Day of the National Flag in Ukraine is celebrated on 23 August; it began in 2004. Previously, 24 July was National Flag Day in Kyiv. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990, at the flagstaff of the Kyiv City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992, the [[Independence Day of Ukraine]] has been celebrated on 24 August. Following a government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this date and certain other holidays; not all are public holidays. Flags must also be flown on parliamentary election days and regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags are flown at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the [[Cabinet of ministers of Ukraine|Cabinet of Ministers]]. When flags are flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast if hung from a pole, or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams if flown like a banner.

 In addition to the normal horizontal format, many public buildings, such as the [[Verkhovna Rada]], use vertical flags. Most town halls fly their town flag together with the national flag in this way; some town flags in Ukraine exist only in vertical form. The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified<!-- (commented out until supporting evidence can be found), although a ratio of 5:2 is the most common-->. When hung like a banner or draped, the blue band should be on the left. When flown from a vertical flagpole, the blue band must face the mast.

 The flag did not appear on [[Postage stamps and postal history of Ukraine|Ukrainian postal stamp]] issues until 1992, when they depicted the flag with the state coat of arms.

 Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with a [[gold (color)|golden]] [[Fringe (trim)|fringe]] surrounding the perimeter of the flag, as long as it does not deface the flag proper.

+The roots of Ukrainian national symbols come from before Christian times when yellow and blue prevailed in traditional ceremonies, reflecting fire and water.<ref name=Saprykov>[http://geraldika.ru/symbols/3334 Geraldika.ru Флаг Украины]</ref> The most solid proof of yellow and blue colors could be traced as far as the [[Battle of Grunwald]] at which participated militia formations from various lands of the Polish-Lithuanian Union.
+
+Yellow–blue, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry color banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between the 16th and 18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their [[hetman]]'s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In fact, the coat of arms of [[Lviv]] to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.
+
+Some put the starting point of the current national flag of Ukraine in year 1848, when during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] a yellow and blue banner was adopted by the [[Main Ruthenian Council]]<ref name=istpravda>[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2014/01/14/140850/ Blue-yellow or yellow-blue?

+Both blue–yellow and yellow–blue flags were widely used during the [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|Ukrainian struggle for independence]] in 1917.

+In 1949 the flag of Ukraine was changed once again.<ref name=grechylo/> The [[Soviet Union]] managed to obtain two additional seats in the [[United Nations]] by adding as members Ukraine along with Belarus.<ref name=grechylo/> The change was due to the fact that all the Soviet flags were the same.<ref name=grechylo/> The new Ukrainian flag consisted of a red (top, 2/3) and a [[azure]] (bottom, 1/3) stripes,<ref name=grechylo/> with the golden star, [[sickle and mallet]] in the top left corner. The Communist party leaders such as [[Khrushchev]] and [[Kaganovich]] were afraid of using words ''light blue'' and ''blue'' which were used by the [[Ukrainian diaspora]].<ref name=grechylo/>
+
+During the Soviet period there were multiple unsanctioned attempts to hoist the national blue-and-yellow flag. In 1958 in village of Verbytsia, [[:uk:Ходорівський район|Khodoriv Raion]] there was established an underground group, members of which at night were raising national flags and spread anti-Soviet pamphlets.<ref>[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/columns/2011/07/29/48180/ Unknown flag-bearers.

+
+===Return of the national flag===
+Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national identity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian SSR (1940–1941 and 1944–1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's historic coat of arms as the state symbol. The Parliaments of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] soon followed.
+
+The events in the Baltic countries soon led to similar processes in Ukraine. Particularly, West Ukraine and [[Ukrainian SSR]]'s capital [[Kiev]] (''Kyiv'') constantly held political demonstrations with the national yellow-and-blue flags waving above the heads of demonstrators.
+
+* On March 20, 1990, the town council of [[Ternopil]] voted upon the usage and re-establishment of the yellow-and-blue flag and the [[Coat of arms of Ukraine|''tryzub'']] as well as the national anthem ''[[Ukraine's glory has not perished|Shche ne vmerla Ukrainy]]''. On the same day, the yellow-and-blue national flag was flown for the first time in about 80 years on a governmental building in Kiev, replacing the then official [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR|red-and-blue flag]] of the Ukrainian SSR.
+* On April 28, 1990, the oblast council (''oblasna rada'') of [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]] also allowed the use of the national symbols of Ukraine within the Oblast.
+* On April 29, 1990, the yellow-and-blue flag was flown from the Ternopil city theater's flagstaff without the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|official flag of the Soviet Union]] hanging above it.
+* After July 24, 1990, the yellow-and-blue flag was flown for the first time over an official governmental building of the [[Kiev City Council]] on the ''[[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]]'' square of the ''[[Khreschatyk]]'' street.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ukrainian/politics/2012/07/120724_flag_ukraine_history_kyiv_as.shtml Twenty two years ago in Kiev officially was raised the blue-yellow flag (22 роки тому в Києві офіційно підняли синьо-жовтий прапор)]. BBC Ukraine. July 24, 2012.</ref>
+* After the declaration of independence of Ukraine on August 24, 1991, the national yellow-and-blue flag flew for the first time over the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament (''Verkhovna Rada'')]] building on September 4, 1991.

+===Attempts to revive Soviet flags===
+[[File:Soviet Znamya Pobedy.svg|right|thumb|150px|""Banner of Victory #5"" was raised just below a statue on the roof of the Reichstag building]]

+
+==Flag controversies and criticism==
+===Origin===
+Some of the theories{{which|date=January 2014}} said that Ukrainian flag was given by the [[Silesia]]n knight{{cn|date=January 2014}} from the city of [[Opole]]—[[Władysław Opolczyk]], Hungarian governor of [[Galicia–Volhynia]]. It has the same colours as the flag of [[Opole]].
+
+=== yellow-blue vs blue-yellow ===
+Interestingly, Ukrainians commonly refer to the flag as '''yellow and light blue''' (жовто-блакитний, ''zhovto-blakytnyi'')<ref>A little less often is used also ""yellow and blue"", ""blue and yellow"" and ""yellow and azure"".</ref> — a different version of the flag used during UNR ([[Ukrainian National Republic]]) years (1917–1921) with yellow on the top and blue on the bottom. The yellow on the top represents golden domes ([[cupola]]s) of Christian churches and the blue the [[Dnieper]] river.
+
+It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language.{{cn|date=January 2014}} Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue,{{cn|date=January 2014}} and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be more appealing to the common person.{{cn|date=January 2014}} The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time,{{cn|date=January 2014}} and, although this evocation of a Ukrainian landscape has nothing to do with the choice of colours or the history of the original yellow and blue, it certainly has formed the Ukrainians' conception of their flag.{{cn|date=January 2014}}
+
+The head of the [[Ukrainian Heraldry Society]], [[Andriy Grechylo]] points to the fact that the discussion about order of colors was taking place as far back as 1918.<ref name=grechylo>[http://gazeta.ua/articles/history/_hruschov-i-kaganovich-boyalisya-slova-zhovto-blakitnij/512859#photo-3 Khrushchev and Kaganovich were afraid of the word ""zhovto-blakytnyi"" (Хрущов і Каганович боялися слова ""жовто-блакитний"")]. Gazette in Ukrainian (gazeta.ua). August 23, 2013</ref> Nonetheless, both governments of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] as well as the [[Ukrainian State]] defined that the upper half would be light-blue, while the lower - yellow.<ref name=grechylo/> During 1918 it was taking in consideration that light blue would loose its shade under sun, therefore it was decided to make color darker.<ref name=grechylo/>
+
+Already in the 1918 draft of Constitution of the [[Ukrainian National Republic]] the order of colors was defined as blue and yellow.<ref name=grechylo/> The same order could be found in legislative acts of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] for November of 1918 and the [[Carpathian Ukraine]] on March 15, 1939.<ref name=grechylo/> The argument on the order of colors was taking place in the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] as well.<ref name=grechylo/> In 1949 it was decided that until in Ukraine it would not be defined a single state flag, the diaspora will be using the blue-and-yellow banner.<ref name=grechylo/>
+
+===Shade of colors===
+There is also criticism in regards to shades.<ref name=grechylo/> There are specialists who argue that according to rules of heraldry current set of colors cannot coexist.<ref>[http://gazeta.ua/articles/history/_sino-zhovtij-prapor-ce-znuschannya-nad-ukrajinskoyu-tradicieyu/508746 Blue-yellow flag is a cruelty towards the Ukrainian traditions (Синьо-жовтий прапор - це знущання над українською традицією)].

The flag is also somewhat similar to that of the [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|Malaysian state]] of [[Flag and coat of arms of Perlis|Perlis]], but has a reversed color arrangement, darker shades of blue and yellow, and a different [[aspect ratio]].

-==Protocol and use==
-{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}<!--only Legal status section has citations-->
-
 ===Legal status===
-
-Article 20 of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] states that ""the State Flag of Ukraine is a banner of two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow colour."" ({{lang-uk|""Державний Прапор України — стяг із двох рівновеликих горизонтальних смуг синього і жовтого кольорів.""}}).<ref name=""constitution_article"">{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine|title=Constitution of Ukraine}}</ref><ref name=constitution_official_uk>{{cite web |url=http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/254%D0%BA/96-%D0%B2%D1%80 |script-title=uk:Конституція України |language=uk |website=Верховна Рада України}}</ref>
-
-===Vertical flags===
-[[File:Hanging flag of Ukraine.svg|thumb|upright=0.25|Hanging version of the Ukrainian flag]]
-
-In addition to the normal horizontal format, many public buildings, such as the [[Verkhovna Rada]], use vertical flags. Most town halls fly their town flag together with the national flag in this way; some town flags in Ukraine exist only in vertical form. The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified<!-- (commented out until supporting evidence can be found), although a ratio of 5:2 is the most common-->. When hung like a banner or draped, the blue band should be on the left. When flown from a vertical flagpole, the blue band must face the mast.
-
-===Stamps===
-[[File:Marka3.jpg|thumbnail|The ""Freedom for Ukraine"" [[Cinderella stamp]], featuring the Ukrainian flag with a gold fringe and a gold [[Coat of arms of Ukraine|coat of arms]] on top of the flag pole]]
-The flag did not appear on [[Postage stamps and postal history of Ukraine|Ukrainian postal stamp]] issues until 1992, when they depicted the flag with the state coat of arms. Since then, the flag has frequently appeared on stamps. [[Cinderella stamp]]s of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] were printed outside Ukraine during the Soviet period for patriotic purposes.
-
-===Decoration===
-Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with a [[gold (color)|golden]] [[Fringe (trim)|fringe]] surrounding the perimeter of the flag, as long as it does not deface the flag proper. The tradition began with the [[flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. In addition, the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' shows a flag decorated with a gold star. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on indoor posts, often use a fringe to enhance the allure of the flag. No specific law governs the use of the fringe. Traditionally, the [[Ukrainian Ground Forces|Army]], [[National Guard of Ukraine|Guard]], [[Ukrainian Navy|Navy]] and [[Ukrainian Air Force|Air Force]] use a fringed flag for [[military parade|parades]], [[colour guard]]s and indoor displays, while the [[President of Ukraine|Office of the President]] and local authorities use a fringed flag on all occasions.
-
-===Places of continuous display===
-[[File:28160-Lviv.jpg|thumbnail|The Ukrainian flag flying on the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]] with the statue of Glory]]
-Ukrainian flags are customarily displayed continuously in certain locations.
-* [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]], main square of [[Kyiv]], traditional site for political rallies, including large-scale radical protest campaigns ([[Orange Revolution]] and [[Euromaidan]])
-* [[Presidential Administration Building (Kyiv)|Presidential Administration Building]], [[Verkhovna Rada building]] and [[Budynok Uryadu]]
-* [[Kyiv City Council]]
-* [[Lviv High Castle]]
-* [[Vernadsky Research Base]]
-* [[State Border Guard Service of Ukraine]] sites
-* National, regional and local government buildings
-* [[Diplomatic missions of Ukraine|Ukrainian embassies and consulates]]
-
-===Particular days for display===
-In particular, the flag should be displayed at full staff on the following days:
-* 1 January: [[New Year's Day]]
-* 7 January: [[Christmas#Date according to Julian calendar|Christmas (Julian)]]
-* 22 January: Ukrainian Unity and Freedom Day
-* 8 March: International Women's Day
-* 1 & 2 May: [[International Workers' Day]]
-* 9 May: Victory Day over Nazism
-* 28 June: Constitution Day
-* 23 August: Flag Day

-* 13 October: Defenders of Ukraine Day
-* 21 November: Day of Dignity and Freedom
-* 6 December: Armed Forces Day
-* 25 December: Christmas (Gregorian/Neo-Julian)
-
-===Display at half-staff===
-The flag is displayed at [[Half-mast|half-staff]] (or half-mast) as a sign of respect or [[mourning]]. When done nationwide, such a step is proclaimed by the president. Half-mast means flying a flag two-thirds of the way up a flagpole; the top of the flag must be at least a flag's height from the top of the flagpole. Black ribbons indicate mourning on banners that can't be lowered to half-mast.
-* 4th Saturday of November: [[Holodomor Memorial Day]]
-* Other historical cases: mass victims of accidents, [[Russo-Ukrainian War]] and [[Euromaidan]]; [[death and state funeral of Lech and Maria Kaczyński]], [[funeral of Pope John Paul II]] and [[11 September attacks]].
-
-==Flag Day==
-[[File:Ukrflagblue.jpg|thumbnail|right|The flag of Ukraine at [[Kyiv]] City Hall]]
-{{main|Day of the National Flag (Ukraine)}}
-
-The Day of the National Flag in Ukraine is celebrated on 23 August; it began in 2004. Previously, 24 July was National Flag Day in Kyiv. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990, at the flagstaff of the Kyiv City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992, the [[Independence Day of Ukraine]] has been celebrated on 24 August. Following a government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this date and certain other holidays; not all are public holidays. Flags must also be flown on parliamentary election days and regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags are flown at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the [[Cabinet of ministers of Ukraine|Cabinet of Ministers]]. When flags are flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast if hung from a pole, or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams if flown like a banner.

-==History==
-[[File:Flag colors.jpg|thumb|Typical agricultural landscape of Ukraine in the [[Kherson Oblast]]]]
-The roots of Ukrainian national symbols come from pre-Christian times when yellow and blue prevailed in traditional ceremonies, reflecting fire and water.<ref name=Saprykov>{{cite web|url=http://geraldika.ru/symbols/3334|script-title=ru:Флаг Украины|trans-title=Flag of Ukraine|language=ru|first=V.|last=Saprykov|website=geraldika.ru|date=May 30, 2003|access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> During the battle of Grunwald in 1410 two Polish banners of [[Lwów Land|Lwów]] and [[Przemyśl Land|Przemyśl Lands]] used flags with yellow and blue colours.
-
-Blue-yellow, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry colour banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between the 16th and 18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their [[hetman]]'s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In fact, the coat of arms of [[Lviv]] to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.
-
-Some put the starting point of the adoption of the current national flag of Ukraine to 1848 when, during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] on 22 April 1848, a blue-and-yellow banner was adopted by the [[Supreme Ruthenian Council]]<ref name=istpravda>{{Cite web|title=Синьо-жовтий чи жовто-блакитний?

Although this move did not have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used blue-and-yellow banners in their insignia.

-The official flag of [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]]'s [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]] was also light blue-yellow and remained the same under the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] of [[Symon Petlura]]. The flag of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] was blue-yellow.

-Among Ukrainian immigrant organisations, there were proponents of both blue-yellow and yellow-blue flags. Eventually, an agreement was reached to use the blue-yellow flag until the issue could be resolved by an independent Ukraine.

The first flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on 10 March 1919, to serve as the symbol of state of [[Soviet Ukraine]]. Details of the official flag changed periodically before the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but all were based on the red flag of the [[October Revolution]] in Russia and an exact replica of the flags of the neighbouring [[Russian SFSR]].
-The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (USSR, acronym for Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika in the [[Russian language]]). In the 1930s, a gold border was added to the flag. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif У.Р.С.Р. (URSR, for Ukrayins’ka Radyans’ka Sotsialistychna Respublika in the Ukrainian language).

-===Interbellum and Reichskommissariat Ukraine===
-The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement was originally created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (interwar Poland at the time). For a long time, the OUN did not officially have its own flag; however, during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the [[Republic of Carpathian Ukraine]] in 1939, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of the OUN, adopted as its flag a design taken from the OUN's emblem – a golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and only officially adopted by the organisation in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
-
-The [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against [[Nazi Germany]], the Soviet Union, [[Czechoslovakia]], and both underground and [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]]. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

-Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], individual Soviet republics gained a strengthened sense of national identity, leading to the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This was particularly true for the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. The national awakening was accompanied by attempts to restore historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940–1941 and 1944–1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's national flag and coat of arms as the state symbol.

-==Flag controversies and criticism==
-{{main|National colours of Ukraine}}
-
-===Origin===
-One claimed version is that, since one of the first known coloured depictions of the Coat of Arms of Kyiv was mainly in yellow-blue colours, this tradition may have existed since the time of the Nordic-Slavic [[Grand Prince of Kyiv]] [[Volodymyr the Great]]. However, the blue-yellow colouring dates back to [[Kievan Rus’]], as an early version of the ''[[Tryzub]]'', Ukraine's national coat of arms, sported the same colouring as the seal of [[Sviatoslav I]] of Kyiv (c. AD 945). During the 1709 [[Battle of Poltava]], the Cossacks following [[Mazepa]] fought under yellow-blue banners, while their Swedish allies were under yellow ones. Some Cossacks and noblemen had coats of arms in yellow and blue.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vannier |first=Alexis |date=24 Aug 2021 |title="" CHTCHE NE VMERLA UKRAÏNY "" : HISTOIRE DU DRAPEAU DE L'UKRAINE |url=https://www.taurillon.org/chtche-ne-vmerla-ukrainy-histoire-du-drapeau-de-l-ukraine?lang=fr |access-date=16 March 2022 |website=taurillon.org |language=fr}}</ref>
-
-===Yellow-blue versus blue-yellow===
-Ukrainians commonly refer to the flag as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy'')<ref>A little less often they use also ""yellow and blue"", ""blue and yellow"" and ""yellow and azure"".</ref>—a different version of the flag used during UNR ([[Ukrainian National Republic]]) years (1917–1921) with yellow on the top and blue on the bottom. The yellow on the top allegedly represents golden domes ([[cupola]]s) of Christian churches and the blue the [[Dnieper]] river.
-
-The head of the [[Ukrainian Heraldry Society]], [[Andriy Grechylo]], points to the fact that the discussion about order of colours was taking place as far back as 1918.<ref name=grechylo>{{Cite news|last=Gazeta.ua|title=Хрущов і Каганович боялися слова ""жовто-блакитний"" (Khrushchev and Kaganovich were afraid of the word ""zhovto-blakytnyi"") |url=https://gazeta.ua/articles/history/_hruschov-i-kaganovich-boyalisya-slova-zhovtoblakitnij-/512859 |date=23 August 2013 |access-date=2022-03-04|website=Gazeta.ua|language=uk}}</ref> Nonetheless, both governments of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] as well as the [[Ukrainian State]] defined that the upper half would be light-blue, while the lower would be yellow.<ref name=grechylo/> During 1918 it was taken into consideration that light blue would lose its shade under sun, therefore it was decided to make the colour darker.<ref name=grechylo/>
-
-Already in the 1918 draft of the Constitution of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], the order of colours was defined as blue and yellow.<ref name=grechylo/> The same order could be found in legislative acts of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] for November 1918 and the [[Republic of Carpathian Ukraine]] on 15 March 1939.<ref name=grechylo/> The argument on the order of colours was taking place in the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] as well.<ref name=grechylo/> In 1949 it was decided that, until Ukraine defined a single state flag, the diaspora would use the blue-and-yellow banner.<ref name=grechylo/>

-The '''state flag of [[Ukraine]]''' ({{lang-uk|державний прапор України}}; [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]]: ''derzhavnyy prapor Ukrayiny''; literally ‘state flag of Ukraine’) is a banner of two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow colour, which symbolize the clear blue sky over yellow wheat field. ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 20|Article 20]])
-
-As a [[national flag]], the blue and yellow bicolor was officially used since the 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] when it was hoisted over the [[Lviv Town Hall|Lviv Rathaus]]. It is was officially adopted as a state flag for the first time in 1918 by the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation, the flag was outlawed and before 1949 there was no official state flag until adoption of the red-blue [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR|flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. People who were hoisting the blue-yellow flags in the Soviet Ukraine were prosecuted as criminals. The blue and yellow flag was provisionally adopted for official ceremonies in September of 1991 following Ukrainian independence, before finally officially being restored in 1992.

-[[File:""Галицькі хоругви у Грюнвальдскій битві 15 липня 1410 року"".jpg|thumb|left|320px|Battle of Gruenwald. Banners of the Lviv and Halych lands.]]
-The roots of Ukrainian national symbols come from before Christian times when yellow and blue prevailed in traditional ceremonies, reflecting fire and water.<ref name=Saprykov>[http://geraldika.ru/symbols/3334 Geraldika.ru Флаг Украины]</ref> The most solid proof of yellow and blue colors could be traced as far as the [[Battle of Grunwald]] at which participated militia formations from various lands of the Polish-Lithuanian Union.
-
-Yellow–blue, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry color banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between the 16th and 18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their [[hetman]]'s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In fact, the coat of arms of [[Lviv]] to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.
-
-Some put the starting point of the current national flag of Ukraine in year 1848, when during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] a yellow and blue banner was adopted by the [[Main Ruthenian Council]]<ref name=istpravda>[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2014/01/14/140850/ Blue-yellow or yellow-blue?

Although this move did not have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used yellow and blue banners in their insignia.
-
-===Short independence: 1917–1920===
-
-Both blue–yellow and yellow–blue flags were widely used during the [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|Ukrainian struggle for independence]] in 1917. For the first time in the [[Russian Empire]] the blue-yellow flag was flown on March 25, 1917 in [[Petrograd]] during a 20-thousand people mass [[Demonstration (protest)|demonstration]].<ref name=istpravda/> On the territory of the Russian Ukraine ([[Little Russia]]) the national flag of Ukraine was flown for the first time in [[Kiev]] on March 29, 1917 by soldiers.<ref name=istpravda/> On April 1, 1917 Kiev saw a 100-thousand people demonstration that carried over 320 national flags.<ref name=istpravda/> After that similar demonstration with Ukrainian flags took place across the whole [[Russian Empire]] even beyond the Ukrainian ethnic lands.<ref name=istpravda/> Number of famous Ukrainian politician wrote their recollection about the April 1 demonstration such as [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] and [[Serhiy Yefremov]] stating that there were blue-and-yellow flags, while [[Dmytro Doroshenko]] claimed that there were yellow-and-blue.<ref name=istpravda/>
-
-The blue-yellow flag was flown at the First Ukrainian Military Congress on May 18, 1917.<ref name=istpravda/>
-
-There are reliable sources that indicate that an official flag was declared by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in 1918 is blue–yellow. Some sources mention that the yellow–blue was adopted by [[Tsentralna Rada]] on March 22, 1918.<ref>[http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=32027&cat_id=31295 State Symbols of Ukraine], [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]], website.</ref> Other sources point out that no hard proof of such decision exists.<ref>http://vexillography.narod.ru/ukraine/unr.htm</ref><ref name=istpravda/> Instead, they refer to the decision on the Fleet Flag, which was set to be light blue–yellow<ref>[http://www.history.org.ua/journal/1999/4/10.pdf Ukrainian Historical Journal, 1999, #4, ISSN 0130-S247]</ref> as an indication that the official flag was light blue–yellow.<ref>[http://vijsko.milua.org/Khoruhvy_HA.htm Українське військо у ХХ-ХХІ сторіччі]</ref> Also were adopted other service flags of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].<ref>Grechylo A. Ukrayinska Terytorialna Heraldyka. Lviv, 2010, pp. 98-118. ISBN 978-966-02-5259-2</ref>
-
-The official flag of [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]]'s [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]] also was light blue–yellow and became the same under [[Symon Petlura]]'s [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]]. The flag of [[West Ukrainian National Republic]] was blue and yellow.  The [[Free Territory|anarchist free-soviets]] that existed during the [[Ukrainian War of Independence|civil war]] used the black flag.
-
-New studies also show that [[Nestor Makhno]]'s formations in 1920 also fought under the blue-and-yellow flags.<ref name=istpravda/>
-
-Among Ukrainian immigrant organizations there were proponents of both blue–yellow and yellow–blue flags. Eventually, it was agreed to use the blue–yellow flag until the issue was resolved in the independent Ukraine.

-{{Main|Flag of the Ukrainian SSR}}
-[[File:Flag colors.jpg|thumb|right|Typical agricultural landscape of Ukraine, Kherson Oblast]]
-The [[Ukrainian SSR|Soviet Ukraine]], similar to other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], used a red flag with the abbreviation ""УСРР"" or ""УРСР"" (Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, or Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic from 1936) in gold in the top left corner. In 1937 the [[hammer and sickle]] symbol in gold was added to the flag.
-
-===Postwar Ukraine===
-In 1949 the flag of Ukraine was changed once again.<ref name=grechylo/> The [[Soviet Union]] managed to obtain two additional seats in the [[United Nations]] by adding as members Ukraine along with Belarus.<ref name=grechylo/> The change was due to the fact that all the Soviet flags were the same.<ref name=grechylo/> The new Ukrainian flag consisted of a red (top, 2/3) and a [[azure]] (bottom, 1/3) stripes,<ref name=grechylo/> with the golden star, [[sickle and mallet]] in the top left corner. The Communist party leaders such as [[Khrushchev]] and [[Kaganovich]] were afraid of using words ''light blue'' and ''blue'' which were used by the [[Ukrainian diaspora]].<ref name=grechylo/>
-
-During the Soviet period there were multiple unsanctioned attempts to hoist the national blue-and-yellow flag. In 1958 in village of Verbytsia, [[:uk:Ходорівський район|Khodoriv Raion]] there was established an underground group, members of which at night were raising national flags and spread anti-Soviet pamphlets.<ref>[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/columns/2011/07/29/48180/ Unknown flag-bearers.

-
-===Return of the national flag===
-Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] years, the individual Soviet republics had strengthened their sense of national identity, which led to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|Collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This concerned the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. These efforts were accompanied with attempts to restore the respective historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian SSR (1940–1941 and 1944–1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's historic coat of arms as the state symbol. The Parliaments of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] soon followed.
-
-The events in the Baltic countries soon led to similar processes in Ukraine. Particularly, West Ukraine and [[Ukrainian SSR]]'s capital [[Kiev]] (''Kyiv'') constantly held political demonstrations with the national yellow-and-blue flags waving above the heads of demonstrators.
-
-* On March 20, 1990, the town council of [[Ternopil]] voted upon the usage and re-establishment of the yellow-and-blue flag and the [[Coat of arms of Ukraine|''tryzub'']] as well as the national anthem ''[[Ukraine's glory has not perished|Shche ne vmerla Ukrainy]]''. On the same day, the yellow-and-blue national flag was flown for the first time in about 80 years on a governmental building in Kiev, replacing the then official [[Flag of Ukrainian SSR|red-and-blue flag]] of the Ukrainian SSR.
-* On April 28, 1990, the oblast council (''oblasna rada'') of [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]] also allowed the use of the national symbols of Ukraine within the Oblast.
-* On April 29, 1990, the yellow-and-blue flag was flown from the Ternopil city theater's flagstaff without the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|official flag of the Soviet Union]] hanging above it.
-* After July 24, 1990, the yellow-and-blue flag was flown for the first time over an official governmental building of the [[Kiev City Council]] on the ''[[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]]'' square of the ''[[Khreschatyk]]'' street.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ukrainian/politics/2012/07/120724_flag_ukraine_history_kyiv_as.shtml Twenty two years ago in Kiev officially was raised the blue-yellow flag (22 роки тому в Києві офіційно підняли синьо-жовтий прапор)]. BBC Ukraine. July 24, 2012.</ref>
-* After the declaration of independence of Ukraine on August 24, 1991, the national yellow-and-blue flag flew for the first time over the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament (''Verkhovna Rada'')]] building on September 4, 1991.

-===Attempts to revive Soviet flags===
-[[File:Soviet Znamya Pobedy.svg|right|thumb|150px|""Banner of Victory #5"" was raised just below a statue on the roof of the Reichstag building]]
-On April 21, 2011 the [[Verkhovna Rada]] adopted a law which allows to raise the [[Victory Banner]] on the Victory Day.<ref>[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/short/2011/04/21/36767/ Rada enforced raising red flags on the May 9 (РАДА ЗОБОВ'ЯЗАЛА ВИВІШУВАТИ ЧЕРВОНІ ПРАПОРИ НА 9 ТРАВНЯ)].

[[Ukrayinska Pravda]].

-==Flag controversies and criticism==
-===Origin===
-Some of the theories{{which|date=January 2014}} said that Ukrainian flag was given by the [[Silesia]]n knight{{cn|date=January 2014}} from the city of [[Opole]]—[[Władysław Opolczyk]], Hungarian governor of [[Galicia–Volhynia]]. It has the same colours as the flag of [[Opole]].
-
-=== yellow-blue vs blue-yellow ===
-Interestingly, Ukrainians commonly refer to the flag as '''yellow and light blue''' (жовто-блакитний, ''zhovto-blakytnyi'')<ref>A little less often is used also ""yellow and blue"", ""blue and yellow"" and ""yellow and azure"".</ref> — a different version of the flag used during UNR ([[Ukrainian National Republic]]) years (1917–1921) with yellow on the top and blue on the bottom. The yellow on the top represents golden domes ([[cupola]]s) of Christian churches and the blue the [[Dnieper]] river.
-
-It has to be noted that although most Ukrainians identify their flag in the verbal language as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy''), the current flag in reality is blue (the top string) and yellow (the bottom string). The issue is quite notable, because the historical rotation of the flag (from yellow–blue to blue–yellow) did not affect the spoken language.{{cn|date=January 2014}} Back in 1848 the flag was indeed yellow and blue,{{cn|date=January 2014}} and it was later rotated to blue and yellow to be more appealing to the common person.{{cn|date=January 2014}} The common explanation of ""blue sky above yellow field of wheat"" was invented around that time,{{cn|date=January 2014}} and, although this evocation of a Ukrainian landscape has nothing to do with the choice of colours or the history of the original yellow and blue, it certainly has formed the Ukrainians' conception of their flag.{{cn|date=January 2014}}
-
-The head of the [[Ukrainian Heraldry Society]], [[Andriy Grechylo]] points to the fact that the discussion about order of colors was taking place as far back as 1918.<ref name=grechylo>[http://gazeta.ua/articles/history/_hruschov-i-kaganovich-boyalisya-slova-zhovto-blakitnij/512859#photo-3 Khrushchev and Kaganovich were afraid of the word ""zhovto-blakytnyi"" (Хрущов і Каганович боялися слова ""жовто-блакитний"")]. Gazette in Ukrainian (gazeta.ua). August 23, 2013</ref> Nonetheless, both governments of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] as well as the [[Ukrainian State]] defined that the upper half would be light-blue, while the lower - yellow.<ref name=grechylo/> During 1918 it was taking in consideration that light blue would loose its shade under sun, therefore it was decided to make color darker.<ref name=grechylo/>
-
-Already in the 1918 draft of Constitution of the [[Ukrainian National Republic]] the order of colors was defined as blue and yellow.<ref name=grechylo/> The same order could be found in legislative acts of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] for November of 1918 and the [[Carpathian Ukraine]] on March 15, 1939.<ref name=grechylo/> The argument on the order of colors was taking place in the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] as well.<ref name=grechylo/> In 1949 it was decided that until in Ukraine it would not be defined a single state flag, the diaspora will be using the blue-and-yellow banner.<ref name=grechylo/>
-
-===Shade of colors===
-There is also criticism in regards to shades.<ref name=grechylo/> There are specialists who argue that according to rules of heraldry current set of colors cannot coexist.<ref>[http://gazeta.ua/articles/history/_sino-zhovtij-prapor-ce-znuschannya-nad-ukrajinskoyu-tradicieyu/508746 Blue-yellow flag is a cruelty towards the Ukrainian traditions (Синьо-жовтий прапор - це знущання над українською традицією)].

+The '''Flag of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Прапор України|Prapor Ukrainy}}) consists of equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow.<ref>[[s:Constitution of Ukraine, 2004#Article 20|Article 20]])</ref> As a [[national flag]], the blue and yellow bicolour has been used since the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 Spring of Nations]], when it was hoisted over [[Lviv Town Hall]]. It was officially adopted as a state flag for the first time in 1918 by the short-lived [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] and subsequently used by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], just before [[World War II]] it was also adopted by [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] in March 1939.
+
+When [[Ukraine]] was part of the [[Soviet Union]], the [[flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was used and the bicolour flag was outlawed. The blue and yellow flag was provisionally adopted for official ceremonies in September 1991 following [[Modern history of Ukraine#Independent Ukraine (1991 to present)|Ukrainian independence]], before officially being restored on 28 January 1992 by the [[Parliament of Ukraine]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ukraine's national flag celebrating 25th anniversary today|url=https://www.unian.info/society/1747301-ukraines-national-flag-celebrating-25th-anniversary-today.html|access-date=2022-03-04|website=[[UNIAN]]|language=en}}</ref><ref name=""Symbolsx2"">{{cite news|last=Trach|first=Nataliya|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/the-story-behind-2-top-ukrainian-symbols-national-flag-and-trident-421675.html|title=The story behind 2 top Ukrainian symbols: National flag and trident|publisher=Kyiv Post|date=26 August 2016|access-date=27 August 2016}}</ref>

+
+===Vertical flags===
+[[File:Hanging flag of Ukraine.svg|thumb|upright=0.25|Hanging version of the Ukrainian flag]]
+
+In addition to the normal horizontal format, many public buildings, such as the [[Verkhovna Rada]], use vertical flags. Most town halls fly their town flag together with the national flag in this way; some town flags in Ukraine exist only in vertical form. The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified<!-- (commented out until supporting evidence can be found), although a ratio of 5:2 is the most common-->. When hung like a banner or draped, the blue band should be on the left. When flown from a vertical flagpole, the blue band must face the mast.
+
+===Stamps===
+[[File:Marka3.jpg|thumbnail|The ""Freedom for Ukraine"" [[Cinderella stamp]], featuring the Ukrainian flag with a gold fringe and a gold [[Coat of arms of Ukraine|coat of arms]] on top of the flag pole]]
+The flag did not appear on [[Postage stamps and postal history of Ukraine|Ukrainian postal stamp]] issues until 1992, when they depicted the flag with the state coat of arms. Since then, the flag has frequently appeared on stamps. [[Cinderella stamp]]s of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] were printed outside Ukraine during the Soviet period for patriotic purposes.
+
+===Decoration===
+Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with a [[gold (color)|golden]] [[Fringe (trim)|fringe]] surrounding the perimeter of the flag, as long as it does not deface the flag proper. The tradition began with the [[flag of the Ukrainian SSR]]. In addition, the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' shows a flag decorated with a gold star. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on indoor posts, often use a fringe to enhance the allure of the flag. No specific law governs the use of the fringe. Traditionally, the [[Ukrainian Ground Forces|Army]], [[National Guard of Ukraine|Guard]], [[Ukrainian Navy|Navy]] and [[Ukrainian Air Force|Air Force]] use a fringed flag for [[military parade|parades]], [[colour guard]]s and indoor displays, while the [[President of Ukraine|Office of the President]] and local authorities use a fringed flag on all occasions.
+
+===Places of continuous display===
+[[File:28160-Lviv.jpg|thumbnail|The Ukrainian flag flying on the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]] with the statue of Glory]]
+Ukrainian flags are customarily displayed continuously in certain locations.
+* [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]], main square of [[Kyiv]], traditional site for political rallies, including large-scale radical protest campaigns ([[Orange Revolution]] and [[Euromaidan]])
+* [[Presidential Administration Building (Kyiv)|Presidential Administration Building]], [[Verkhovna Rada building]] and [[Budynok Uryadu]]
+* [[Kyiv City Council]]
+* [[Lviv High Castle]]
+* [[Vernadsky Research Base]]
+* [[State Border Guard Service of Ukraine]] sites
+* National, regional and local government buildings
+* [[Diplomatic missions of Ukraine|Ukrainian embassies and consulates]]
+
+===Particular days for display===
+In particular, the flag should be displayed at full staff on the following days:
+* 1 January: [[New Year's Day]]
+* 7 January: [[Christmas#Date according to Julian calendar|Christmas (Julian)]]
+* 22 January: Ukrainian Unity and Freedom Day
+* 8 March: International Women's Day
+* 1 & 2 May: [[International Workers' Day]]
+* 9 May: Victory Day over Nazism
+* 28 June: Constitution Day
+* 23 August: Flag Day

+* 13 October: Defenders of Ukraine Day
+* 21 November: Day of Dignity and Freedom
+* 6 December: Armed Forces Day
+* 25 December: Christmas (Gregorian/Neo-Julian)
+
+===Display at half-staff===
+The flag is displayed at [[Half-mast|half-staff]] (or half-mast) as a sign of respect or [[mourning]]. When done nationwide, such a step is proclaimed by the president. Half-mast means flying a flag two-thirds of the way up a flagpole; the top of the flag must be at least a flag's height from the top of the flagpole. Black ribbons indicate mourning on banners that can't be lowered to half-mast.
+* 4th Saturday of November: [[Holodomor Memorial Day]]
+* Other historical cases: mass victims of accidents, [[Russo-Ukrainian War]] and [[Euromaidan]]; [[death and state funeral of Lech and Maria Kaczyński]], [[funeral of Pope John Paul II]] and [[11 September attacks]].

+==Flag Day==
+[[File:Ukrflagblue.jpg|thumbnail|right|The flag of Ukraine at [[Kyiv]] City Hall]]
+{{main|Day of the National Flag (Ukraine)}}
+
+The Day of the National Flag in Ukraine is celebrated on 23 August; it began in 2004. Previously, 24 July was National Flag Day in Kyiv. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990, at the flagstaff of the Kyiv City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992, the [[Independence Day of Ukraine]] has been celebrated on 24 August. Following a government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this date and certain other holidays; not all are public holidays. Flags must also be flown on parliamentary election days and regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags are flown at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the [[Cabinet of ministers of Ukraine|Cabinet of Ministers]]. When flags are flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast if hung from a pole, or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams if flown like a banner.

+==History==
+[[File:Flag colors.jpg|thumb|Typical agricultural landscape of Ukraine in the [[Kherson Oblast]]]]
+The roots of Ukrainian national symbols come from pre-Christian times when yellow and blue prevailed in traditional ceremonies, reflecting fire and water.<ref name=Saprykov>{{cite web|url=http://geraldika.ru/symbols/3334|script-title=ru:Флаг Украины|trans-title=Flag of Ukraine|language=ru|first=V.|last=Saprykov|website=geraldika.ru|date=May 30, 2003|access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> During the battle of Grunwald in 1410 two Polish banners of [[Lwów Land|Lwów]] and [[Przemyśl Land|Przemyśl Lands]] used flags with yellow and blue colours.
+
+Blue-yellow, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry colour banners were widely used by [[Cossack]]s between the 16th and 18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their [[hetman]]'s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. In fact, the coat of arms of [[Lviv]] to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.
+
+Some put the starting point of the adoption of the current national flag of Ukraine to 1848 when, during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Spring of the Nations]] on 22 April 1848, a blue-and-yellow banner was adopted by the [[Supreme Ruthenian Council]]<ref name=istpravda>{{Cite web|title=Синьо-жовтий чи жовто-блакитний?

Although this move did not have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Austrian army used blue-and-yellow banners in their insignia.
+
+During the [[Revolution of 1905|Russian Revolution of 1905]], this flag was used by Ukrainians of the [[Dnieper Ukraine]].

+The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement was originally created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (interwar Poland at the time). For a long time, the OUN did not officially have its own flag; however, during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the [[Republic of Carpathian Ukraine]] in 1939, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of the OUN, adopted as its flag a design taken from the OUN's emblem – a golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and only officially adopted by the organisation in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.
+
+The [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against [[Nazi Germany]], the Soviet Union, [[Czechoslovakia]], and both underground and [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]]. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

+In 1949, the flag of the Soviet Ukraine was changed once again.<ref name=grechylo/> The [[Soviet Union]] managed to obtain two additional seats in the [[United Nations]] by adding Ukraine and [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussia]] as [[Member states of the United Nations|member states]].<ref name=""grechylo"" /> The flag change came about because all the Soviet flags were the same.<ref name=""grechylo"" /> The new Ukrainian flag consisted of red (top, 2/3) and [[azure (color)|azure]] (bottom, 1/3) stripes,<ref name=""grechylo"" /> with the golden star, [[hammer and sickle]] in the top left corner. Communist party leaders such as [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Lazar Kaganovich]] feared using words like 'light blue' and 'blue' in the official flag colors, as they were the terms used by the [[Ukrainian diaspora]].<ref name=grechylo/>
+
+During the Soviet period, multiple unsanctioned attempts to hoist the national blue-and-yellow flag were made. In 1958, an underground group was established in the village of Verbytsia, [[:uk:Ходорівський район|Khodoriv Raion]]; its members raised national flags and spread anti-Soviet pamphlets under cover of darkness.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Невідомі прапороносці.

+Under the influence of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], individual Soviet republics gained a strengthened sense of national identity, leading to the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This was particularly true for the three [[Baltic states]] and [[West Ukrainian National Republic|Western Ukraine]], which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. The national awakening was accompanied by attempts to restore historical national symbols. In 1988, the [[List of Lithuanian rulers#Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940–1941 and 1944–1990)|Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] [[Coat of arms of Lithuania#History|re-established]] Lithuania's national flag and coat of arms as the state symbol. The parliaments of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] soon followed suit.

+
+The events in the Baltic countries soon led to similar patterns in Ukraine. In particular, West Ukraine and the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]'s capital city of [[Kyiv]] were the scenes of near-constant political demonstrations, in which yellow-and-blue flags were waved by demonstrators.

+==Flag controversies and criticism==
+{{main|National colours of Ukraine}}
+
+===Origin===
+One claimed version is that, since one of the first known coloured depictions of the Coat of Arms of Kyiv was mainly in yellow-blue colours, this tradition may have existed since the time of the Nordic-Slavic [[Grand Prince of Kyiv]] [[Volodymyr the Great]]. However, the blue-yellow colouring dates back to [[Kievan Rus’]], as an early version of the ''[[Tryzub]]'', Ukraine's national coat of arms, sported the same colouring as the seal of [[Sviatoslav I]] of Kyiv (c. AD 945). During the 1709 [[Battle of Poltava]], the Cossacks following [[Mazepa]] fought under yellow-blue banners, while their Swedish allies were under yellow ones. Some Cossacks and noblemen had coats of arms in yellow and blue.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vannier |first=Alexis |date=24 Aug 2021 |title="" CHTCHE NE VMERLA UKRAÏNY "" : HISTOIRE DU DRAPEAU DE L'UKRAINE |url=https://www.taurillon.org/chtche-ne-vmerla-ukrainy-histoire-du-drapeau-de-l-ukraine?lang=fr |access-date=16 March 2022 |website=taurillon.org |language=fr}}</ref>
+
+===Yellow-blue versus blue-yellow===
+Ukrainians commonly refer to the flag as ""yellow and light blue"" ({{lang-uk|жовто-блакитний}}, ''zhovto-blakytnyy'')<ref>A little less often they use also ""yellow and blue"", ""blue and yellow"" and ""yellow and azure"".</ref>—a different version of the flag used during UNR ([[Ukrainian National Republic]]) years (1917–1921) with yellow on the top and blue on the bottom. The yellow on the top allegedly represents golden domes ([[cupola]]s) of Christian churches and the blue the [[Dnieper]] river.
+
+The head of the [[Ukrainian Heraldry Society]], [[Andriy Grechylo]], points to the fact that the discussion about order of colours was taking place as far back as 1918.<ref name=grechylo>{{Cite news|last=Gazeta.ua|title=Хрущов і Каганович боялися слова ""жовто-блакитний"" (Khrushchev and Kaganovich were afraid of the word ""zhovto-blakytnyi"") |url=https://gazeta.ua/articles/history/_hruschov-i-kaganovich-boyalisya-slova-zhovtoblakitnij-/512859 |date=23 August 2013 |access-date=2022-03-04|website=Gazeta.ua|language=uk}}</ref> Nonetheless, both governments of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] as well as the [[Ukrainian State]] defined that the upper half would be light-blue, while the lower would be yellow.<ref name=grechylo/> During 1918 it was taken into consideration that light blue would lose its shade under sun, therefore it was decided to make the colour darker.<ref name=grechylo/>
+
+Already in the 1918 draft of the Constitution of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], the order of colours was defined as blue and yellow.<ref name=grechylo/> The same order could be found in legislative acts of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] for November 1918 and the [[Republic of Carpathian Ukraine]] on 15 March 1939.<ref name=grechylo/> The argument on the order of colours was taking place in the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] as well.<ref name=grechylo/> In 1949 it was decided that, until Ukraine defined a single state flag, the diaspora would use the blue-and-yellow banner.<ref name=grechylo/>

-==Flag of the head of state==
-Throughout the history of [[Ukraine]], various [[List of heads of state of Ukraine|heads of state]] have used different flags. The designs differ according to the historical era during which they were used and the political situation in [[Ukraine]] at the time. [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]] was the first [[List of leaders of Ukraine|Ukrainian head of state]] to use a flag. The current design, the flag of the [[President of Ukraine]], was adopted in 1999. In 2022, the President of Ukraine used a variant in which the left side of the blue upper-half contains the yellow ''[[Coat of arms of Ukraine|Tryzub]]'' (coat of arms).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Basu|first=Zachary|date=2022-03-01|title=Zelensky tells European Parliament ""nobody is going to break us"" in emotional appeal|url=https://www.axios.com/zelensky-video-european-parliament-address-ukraine-ed88a2e1-ff9e-471c-9a4d-92e0406ff541.html|access-date=2022-03-04|website=Axios|language=en}}</ref>

 ===Origin===
 One claimed version is that, since one of the first known coloured depictions of the [[Coat of Arms of Kyiv]] was mainly in yellow-blue colours, this tradition may have existed since the time of the Nordic-Slavic [[Grand Prince of Kyiv]] [[Volodymyr the Great]]. However, the blue-yellow colouring dates back to [[Kievan Rus’]], as an early version of the ''[[Tryzub]]'', Ukraine's national coat of arms, sported the same colouring as the seal of [[Sviatoslav I]] of Kyiv (c. AD 945). During the 1709 [[Battle of Poltava]], the Cossacks following [[Mazepa]] fought under yellow-blue banners, while their Swedish allies were under yellow ones. Some Cossacks and noblemen had coats of arms in yellow and blue.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vannier |first=Alexis |date=24 Aug 2021 |title="" CHTCHE NE VMERLA UKRAÏNY "" : HISTOIRE DU DRAPEAU DE L'UKRAINE |url=https://www.taurillon.org/chtche-ne-vmerla-ukrainy-histoire-du-drapeau-de-l-ukraine?lang=fr |access-date=16 March 2022 |website=taurillon.org |language=fr}}</ref>

 The [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against [[Nazi Germany]], the Soviet Union, [[Czechoslovakia]], and both underground and [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]]. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise 'Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth'.

The designs differ according to the historical era they were used in and in accordance with the political scene in [[Ukraine]] at the time. The first flag to be used by a [[List of heads of state of Ukraine|head of state of Ukraine]] was that of [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]].

 In addition to the normal horizontal format, many public buildings, such as the [[Verkhovna Rada]], use vertical flags.

The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified<!-- (commented out until supporting evidence can be found), although a ratio of 5:2 is the most common-->.

 One claimed version is that, since one of the first known coloured depictions of the [[Coat of Arms of Kyiv]] was mainly in yellow-blue colours, this tradition may have existed since the time of the Nordic-Slavic [[Grand Prince of Kyiv]] [[Volodymyr the Great]]. However, the blue-yellow colouring dates back to [[Kievan Rus’]], as an early version of the ''[[Tryzub]]'', Ukraine's national coat of arms, sported the same colouring as the seal of [[Sviatoslav I]] of Kyiv (c. AD 945). During the 1709 [[Battle of Poltava]], the Cossacks following [[Mazepa]] fought under yellow-blue banners, while their Swedish allies were under yellow ones.

The first flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on 10 March 1919, to serve as the symbol of state of [[Soviet Ukraine]]. Details of the official flag changed periodically before the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but all were based on the red flag of the [[October Revolution]] in Russia and an exact replica of the flags of the neighbouring [[Russian SFSR]].
 The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters У.С.С.Р. (USSR, acronym for Ukrayinskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Sovetskaya Respublika in the [[Russian language]]). In the 1930s, a gold border was added to the flag. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif У.Р.С.Р. (URSR, for Ukrayins’ka Radyans’ka Sotsialistychna Respublika in the Ukrainian language).
