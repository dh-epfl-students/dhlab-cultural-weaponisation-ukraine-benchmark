In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 The attack of the [[German]] units over the [[Soviet]] Union on 22nd of 1941 caused a wave of an enthusiasm among the Cossaks. This was an issue of their generally known hatred of the communists. As early as the middle of 1942, a Cossack cavalry formation existed in German controlled [[Mohylev]], under the command of a former Soviet major, Kononov, who had crossed over to the Germans at the first opportunity with the greater part of his regiment, and began service on the side of the Germans by guarding the line of communications against [[Soviet]] partisans.
 
-In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. They greeted the Germans as liberators. The entire population of towns, villages and settlements went out to meet the German troops with flowers and gifts of all kinds, singing their national anthems. Cossack formations of the [[Red Army]] were coming over to the Germans in a body; new formations were springing up, apparently from nowhere, in traditional uniform and armed with swords, pistols, daggers, and rifles that had been buried for years. One of the most famous Cossack leaders, ataman [[Kulakov]], who since 1919 had been believed dead, came out of hiding and, accompanied by hundreds of made a triumphant drive into [[Poltava]].

 The [[Cossack National Movement of Liberation]], whose aim was the rebuilding of an independent Cossack state, patronized the recruiting of Cossacks for the fight against the Soviets. In the summer of 1943, the 1st Cossack Division was formed under the command of General [[Helmut von Pannwitz]]. The division soon expanded into the 15th SS Cossack Cavalry Corps, which numbered some 50,000 men. Afterwards, two Cossack brigades and 12 Cossack reserve regiments were formed, and a number of smaller units were attached to German formations. In all, Cossack troops on the German side numbered about 250,000 men.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. They greeted the Germans as liberators. The entire population of towns, villages and settlements went out to meet the German troops with flowers and gifts of all kinds, singing their national anthems. Cossack formations of the [[Red Army]] were coming over to the Germans in a body; new formations were springing up, apparently from nowhere, in traditional uniform and armed with swords, pistols, daggers, and rifles that had been buried for years. One of the most famous Cossack leaders, ataman [[Kulakov]], who since 1919 had been believed dead, came out of hiding and, accompanied by hundreds of supporters made a triumphant drive into [[Poltava]]. 
 
-The [[Cossack National Movement of Liberation]], whose aim was the rebuilding of an independent Cossack state, patronized the recruiting of Cossacks for the fight against the Soviets. In the summer of 1943, the 1st Cossack Division was formed under the command of General [[Helmut von Pannwitz]]. The division soon expanded into the 15th SS Cossack Cavalry Corps, which numbered some 50,000 men. Afterwards, two Cossack brigades and 12 Cossack reserve regiments were formed, and a number of smaller units were attached to German formations. In all, Cossack troops on the German side numbered about 250,000 men.

 It should be explained here that the granting of the SS status to the Cossack Corps was Himmler's device, quite often applied, for barring the Wehrmacht's influence in political concerns of the foreign formations. The Germans used the Cossacks to fight Soviet partisans, to cover the rear of their armies, and sometimes for action on the front. Later on, some Cossack formations were moved to France and Yugoslavia. The Cossack command objected, on the ground that the Cossacks should fight only against the Soviets, but in vain.

Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades.

 On June 1st, about 25,000 people were handed to the Soviets from the Cossack camp in Linz which held 32,000 persons, mainly old men, women, and children who were in fact refugees, though among them were also Cossack soldiers. Even after the specified period of the delivery of prisoners, Soviet military missions made unexpected raids on Displaced Persons camps in the American and British zones, and took from them many people by force. In all, over 150,000 Cossacks were handed over to the USSR.
 The statement of the Cossack emigrant mentioned before quotes the impressions of a British sailor given here without alteration: 
 
-""I took part in the evacuation of Dunkirk. Our soldiers felt very badly. I helped to fish out Germans from the sunken Bismarck, which received the greatest number of torpedoes in history. I saw the population of Malta sitting in the cellars for many weeks. I saw Malta being bombed incessantly and deafened by explosions of bombs and shells. They were exhausted from constant explosions and alarms. I lived through the sinking of my own ship. I know about jumping into the water at night, dark and without bottom, and the terrifying shouts for help of the drow- ning, and then the boat, and looking for the rescue ship. It was a nightmare. I drove German prisoners captured during the invasion of Normandy. They were almost dying from fear. But all that is nothing. The real, terrible, unspeakable fear I saw during the convoying and repatriation of people to Soviet Russia. They were becoming white, green and grey with the fear that took hold of them. When we arrived at the port and were handing them over to the Russians, the repatriates were fainting and losing their senses. And only now I know what a man's fear is who lived through hell, and that it is nothing compared to the fear of a man who is returning to the Soviet hell.""

 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. They greeted the Germans as liberators. The entire population of towns, villages and settlements went out to meet the German troops with flowers and gifts of all kinds, singing their national anthems. Cossack formations of the [[Red Army]] were coming over to the Germans in a body; new formations were springing up, apparently from nowhere, in traditional uniform and armed with swords, pistols, daggers, and rifles that had been buried for years. One of the most famous Cossack leaders, ataman [[Kulakov]], who since 1919 had been believed dead, came out of hiding and, accompanied by hundreds of supporters made a triumphant drive into [[Poltava]].

Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows:

-The attack of the [[German]] units over the [[Soviet]] Union on 22nd of 1941 caused a wave of an enthusiasm among the Cossaks. This was an issue of their generally known hatred of the communists. As early as the middle of 1942, a Cossack cavalry formation existed in German controlled [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], under the command of a former Soviet major, Kononov, who had crossed over to the Germans at the first opportunity with the greater part of his regiment, and began service on the side of the Germans by guarding the line of communications against [[Soviet]] partisans.

 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. They greeted the Germans as liberators. The entire population of towns, villages and settlements went out to meet the German troops with flowers and gifts of all kinds, singing their national anthems. Cossack formations of the [[Red Army]] were coming over to the Germans in a body; new formations were springing up, apparently from nowhere, in traditional uniform and armed with swords, pistols, daggers, and rifles that had been buried for years. One of the most famous Cossack leaders, ataman [[Kulakov]], who since 1919 had been believed dead, came out of hiding and, accompanied by hundreds of supporters made a triumphant drive into [[Poltava]].

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18.

The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 == Cossacks in the World War II ==
 
-''to be written soon''
+
+The attack of the [[German]] units over the [[Soviet]] Union on 22nd of 1941 caused a wave of an enthusiasm among the Cossaks. This was an issue of their generally known hatred of the communists. As early as the middle of 1942, a Cossack cavalry formation existed in German controlled [[Mohylev]], under the command of a former Soviet major, Kononov, who had crossed over to the Germans at the first opportunity with the greater part of his regiment, and began service on the side of the Germans by guarding the line of communications against [[Soviet]] partisans.
+
+In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. They greeted the Germans as liberators. The entire population of towns, villages and settlements went out to meet the German troops with flowers and gifts of all kinds, singing their national anthems. Cossack formations of the [[Red Army]] were coming over to the Germans in a body; new formations were springing up, apparently from nowhere, in traditional uniform and armed with swords, pistols, daggers, and rifles that had been buried for years. One of the most famous Cossack leaders, ataman [[Kulakov]], who since 1919 had been believed dead, came out of hiding and, accompanied by hundreds of made a triumphant drive into [[Poltava]]. 
+
+The [[Cossack National Movement of Liberation]], whose aim was the rebuilding of an independent Cossack state, patronized the recruiting of Cossacks for the fight against the Soviets. In the summer of 1943, the 1st Cossack Division was formed under the command of General [[Helmut von Pannwitz]]. The division soon expanded into the 15th SS Cossack Cavalry Corps, which numbered some 50,000 men. Afterwards, two Cossack brigades and 12 Cossack reserve regiments were formed, and a number of smaller units were attached to German formations. In all, Cossack troops on the German side numbered about 250,000 men. 
+
+It should be explained here that the granting of the SS status to the Cossack Corps was Himmler's device, quite often applied, for barring the Wehrmacht's influence in political concerns of the foreign formations. The Germans used the Cossacks to fight Soviet partisans, to cover the rear of their armies, and sometimes for action on the front. Later on, some Cossack formations were moved to France and Yugoslavia. The Cossack command objected, on the ground that the Cossacks should fight only against the Soviets, but in vain.
+
+The 2nd KONR Division split in two parts; the greater part, together with the Cossack Corps of General von Pannwitz, surrendered to the British on May 12th, in Austria, to be interned in the area of Klagenfurt - St. Veit. One regiment of the 2nd Division and the Army's Headquarters reached the American zone after a long and weary journey, and were interned at Landau, in western Bavaria.
+On May 27th, in accordance with the agreement signed in Vienna by British and Soviet authorities, the British began to hand over to the Soviets the interned soldiers of the Eastern formations as well as the Cossacks. On that day, in Graz, there were handed over the generals von Pannwitz, Krasnov, and [[Shkuro]]. All three hoped to the last that they would be spared this fate, for the first was a German, and the other two old Tsarist Russian emigrants and never were Soviet citizens.
+
+On 28th of May a conference was called in the little town of Spittal in Austria, to which the British commander had invited the entire officers' corps from the Cossack camp: 35 generals, 167 colonels, 283 lieutenant-colonels, 375 captains, 1,752 subalterns, 136 military functionaries and doctors, two chaplains, two band leaders, two photographers, and two interpreters, in all 2,756 persons. At the time of the departure from the camp, 2,201 reported ready for the journey, the remainder having refused to be loaded on the trucks, or having disappeared. On the way to Linz, 55 of them committed suicide; 2,146 were handed over to the NKVD. Among them were 1,856 Cossack officers, 176 Russians, 63 Ukrainians, 31 Caucasians, and a handful of other nationals. As to the fate of those delivered: 12 generals were sent to Moscow, 120 officers were shot on the way to Vienna by Soviet soldiers of the convoy, 1,030 officers died during the interrogations by the NKVD, 983 officers were ""passed along""; many of this group were sent to mines in the Urals, and deprived of the right to come out to the surface of the earth.
+
+On June 1st, about 25,000 people were handed to the Soviets from the Cossack camp in Linz which held 32,000 persons, mainly old men, women, and children who were in fact refugees, though among them were also Cossack soldiers. Even after the specified period of the delivery of prisoners, Soviet military missions made unexpected raids on Displaced Persons camps in the American and British zones, and took from them many people by force. In all, over 150,000 Cossacks were handed over to the USSR.
+The statement of the Cossack emigrant mentioned before quotes the impressions of a British sailor given here without alteration: 
+
+""I took part in the evacuation of Dunkirk. Our soldiers felt very badly. I helped to fish out Germans from the sunken Bismarck, which received the greatest number of torpedoes in history. I saw the population of Malta sitting in the cellars for many weeks. I saw Malta being bombed incessantly and deafened by explosions of bombs and shells. They were exhausted from constant explosions and alarms. I lived through the sinking of my own ship. I know about jumping into the water at night, dark and without bottom, and the terrifying shouts for help of the drow- ning, and then the boat, and looking for the rescue ship. It was a nightmare. I drove German prisoners captured during the invasion of Normandy. They were almost dying from fear. But all that is nothing. The real, terrible, unspeakable fear I saw during the convoying and repatriation of people to Soviet Russia. They were becoming white, green and grey with the fear that took hold of them. When we arrived at the port and were handing them over to the Russians, the repatriates were fainting and losing their senses. And only now I know what a man's fear is who lived through hell, and that it is nothing compared to the fear of a man who is returning to the Soviet hell.""

+===Origin myths===
+Cossacks allegedly began as a [[non-exclusive ethnic group]] which grew out of various [[Huns | Hun]] and Turko-Mongol equestrian pastoralists. From them derives the [[Kazakh]] term ''[[Cossack]]'' meaning ""wanderer/adventurer"" Though the Kazakhs mostly adopted [[Islam]], [[Orthodox Christianity]] soon became the representative religion of the the Cossack ""ethnicity"". Similarly Slavic replaced Turkic as the necessary communication base. In legend, outlaws from all across Europe made their way to the [[steppe]]s of the [[Ukraine]] to enjoy the freedom of cossack life.

-The attack launched by [[Germany|German]] units on the [[Soviet]] Union on [[22 June]]  [[1941]] caused a wave of an enthusiasm among the Cossaks. This stemmed from their generally-known hatred of the communists. As early as the middle of 1942, a Cossack cavalry formation existed in German controlled [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], under the command of a former Soviet major, Kononov, who had crossed over to the Germans at the first opportunity with the greater part of his regiment, and began service on the side of the Germans by guarding the line of communications against [[Soviet]] partisans.

As early as the middle of 1942, a Cossack cavalry formation existed in German-controlled [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], under the command of a former [[Soviet]] major, Ivan Kononov, who had crossed over to the Germans on [[22 August]] [[1941]] with the greater part of his 436th regiment, and began service on the side of the Germans by guarding lines of communications against Soviet [[partisan]]s.
 
 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks, who greeted the Germans as liberators. The entire populations of towns, villages and settlements went out to meet the German troops with flowers and gifts of all kinds, singing their national anthems. Cossack formations of the [[Red Army]] would come over to the Germans in a body; new formations would spring up, apparently from nowhere, in traditional uniform and armed with swords, pistols, daggers, and rifles that had remained buried for years. One of the most famous Cossack leaders, ataman [[Kulakov]], believed dead since 1919, came out of hiding and, accompanied by hundreds of supporters, made a triumphant drive into [[Poltava]]. 
 
-The [[Cossack National Movement of Liberation]], whose aim was the rebuilding of an independent Cossack state, fostered the recruiting of Cossacks for the fight against the Soviets. The summer of 1943 saw the formation of the 1st Cossack Division, under the command of the German general [[Helmut von Pannwitz]]. The division soon expanded into the 15th [[SS]] Cossack Cavalry Corps, which numbered some 50,000 men. Afterwards, two Cossack brigades and 12 Cossack reserve regiments formed, and a number of smaller units became attached to German formations. In all, Cossack troops on the German side numbered about 250,000 men.

 Note that the granting of the ""SS"" status to the Cossack Corps came about through [[Heinrich Himmler | Himmler]]'s policy, quite often applied, of barring the [[Wehrmacht]]'s influence in the political concerns of non-German formations. The Germans used the Cossacks to fight Soviet partisans, to cover the rear of their armies, and sometimes for action on the front. Later on, some Cossack formations moved to [[France]] and to [[Yugoslavia]]. The Cossack command objected, on the ground that the Cossacks should fight only against the Soviets, but in vain.
 
-The 2nd KONR Division split into two parts; the greater part, together with the Cossack Corps of General von Pannwitz, surrendered to the British on [[12 May]] [[1945]], in Austria, and went into internment in the area of [[Klagenfurt]] - St. Veit. One regiment of the 2nd Division and the Army's Headquarters reached the American zone after a long and weary journey, and went into internment at [[Landau]], in western [[Bavaria]].

 On [[27 May]] [[1945]], in accordance with the agreement signed in Vienna by British and Soviet authorities, the British began to hand over to the Soviets the interned soldiers of the Eastern formations as well as the Cossacks. On that day, in Graz, they handed over the generals von Pannwitz, Krasnov, and [[Shkuro]]. All three hoped to the last that they would escape this fate, for von Pannwitz held German nationality, and the other two had emigrated from Tsarist Russia and had never held Soviet citizenship.
 
-On [[28 May]] [[1945]] the local British commander invited to a conference  in the little town of Spittal in Austria the entire officer corps from the Cossack camp: 35 generals, 167 colonels, 283 lieutenant-colonels, 375 captains, 1,752 subalterns, 136 military functionaries and doctors, two chaplains, two band leaders, two photographers, and two interpreters, in all 2,756 persons.

Even after the specified period of the delivery of prisoners, Soviet military missions made unexpected raids on Displaced Persons camps in the American and British zones, and took from them many people by force.

 The statement of a Cossack emigrant quotes the impressions of a British sailor given here without alteration: 
 
 ""I took part in the evacuation of [[Dunkirk]]. Our soldiers felt very badly. I helped to fish out Germans from the sunken [[German battleship Bismarck | ''Bismarck'']], which received the greatest number of torpedoes in history. I saw the population of [[Malta]] sitting in the cellars for many weeks. I saw Malta being bombed incessantly and deafened by explosions of bombs and shells. They were exhausted from constant explosions and alarms. I lived through the sinking of my own ship. I know about jumping into the water at night, dark and without bottom, and the terrifying shouts for help of the drowning, and then the boat, and looking for the rescue ship. It was a nightmare. I drove German prisoners captured during the invasion of [[Normandy]]. They were almost dying from fear. But all that is nothing. The real, terrible, unspeakable fear I saw during the convoying and repatriation of people to Soviet Russia. They were becoming white, green and grey with the fear that took hold of them. When we arrived at the port and were handing them over to the Russians, the repatriates were fainting and losing their senses. And only now I know what a man's fear is who lived through hell, and that it is nothing compared to the fear of a man who is returning to the Soviet hell.""

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.

 The attack launched by [[Germany|German]] units on the [[Soviet]] Union on [[22 June]]  [[1941]] caused a wave of an enthusiasm among the Cossaks. This stemmed from their generally-known hatred of the communists. As early as the middle of 1942, a Cossack cavalry formation existed in German controlled [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], under the command of a former Soviet major, Kononov, who had crossed over to the Germans at the first opportunity with the greater part of his regiment, and began service on the side of the Germans by guarding the line of communications against [[Soviet]] partisans.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses.

-The attack launched by [[Germany|German]] units on the [[Soviet Union]] on [[22 June]]  [[1941]] caused a wave of an enthusiasm among the Cossaks. This stemmed from their generally-known hatred of the [[communism | communist]]s. As early as the middle of 1942, a Cossack cavalry formation existed in German-controlled [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], under the command of a former [[Soviet]] major, Ivan Kononov, who had crossed over to the Germans on [[22 August]] [[1941]] with the greater part of his 436th regiment, and began service on the side of the Germans by guarding lines of communications against Soviet [[partisan]]s.

 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks, who greeted the Germans as liberators. The entire populations of towns, villages and settlements went out to meet the German troops with flowers and gifts of all kinds, singing their national anthems. Cossack formations of the [[Red Army]] would come over to the Germans in a body; new formations would spring up, apparently from nowhere, in traditional uniform and armed with swords, pistols, daggers, and rifles that had remained buried for years. One of the most famous Cossack leaders, ataman [[Kulakov]], believed dead since 1919, came out of hiding and, accompanied by hundreds of supporters, made a triumphant drive into [[Poltava]].

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses).

The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

-Cossacks began as a [[non-exclusive ethnic group]] which grew out of the various Hun & Turko-Mongol equestrian pastorialists from whom the term Cossack meaning wanderer/adventurer in Kazakh derives.

Similarly Slavic replaced Turkic as the necessary communication base.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).

 All Cossack males had to perform military service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. 
 
 Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18-26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

 Note that the granting of the ""SS"" status to the Cossack Corps came about through [[Heinrich Himmler | Himmler]]'s policy, quite often applied, of barring the [[Wehrmacht]]'s influence in the political concerns of non-German formations. The Germans used the Cossacks to fight Soviet partisans, to cover the rear of their armies, and sometimes for action on the front. Later on, some Cossack formations moved to [[France]] and to [[Yugoslavia]]. The Cossack command objected, on the ground that the Cossacks should fight only against the Soviets, but in vain.
 
-The 2nd KONR Division split into two parts; the greater part, together with the Cossack Corps of General von Pannwitz, surrendered to the British on [[12 May]] [[1945]], in [[Austria]], and went into internment in the area of [[Klagenfurt]] - St. Veit.

 On [[27 May]] [[1945]], in accordance with the agreement signed in Vienna by British and Soviet authorities, the British began to hand over to the Soviets the interned soldiers of the Eastern formations as well as the Cossacks. On that day, in Graz, they handed over the generals von Pannwitz, Krasnov, and [[Shkuro]]. All three hoped to the last that they would escape this fate, for von Pannwitz held German nationality, and the other two had emigrated from Tsarist Russia and had never held Soviet citizenship.
 
 On [[28 May]] [[1945]] the local British commander invited to a conference  in the little town of Spittal in Austria the entire officer corps from the Cossack camp: 35 generals, 167 colonels, 283 lieutenant-colonels, 375 captains, 1,752 subalterns, 136 military functionaries and doctors, two chaplains, two band leaders, two photographers, and two interpreters: in all 2,756 persons. At the time of the departure from the camp, 2,201 Cossacks reported ready for the journey, the remainder having refused to board the trucks, or having disappeared. On the way to [[Linz]], 55 of them committed suicide; the [[NKVD]] took 2,146 into custody. The prisoners included 1,856 Cossack officers, 176 Russians, 63 Ukrainians, 31 Caucasians, and a handful of other nationals. As to the fate of those delivered: 12 generals went to Moscow, Soviet soldiers of the convoy shot 120 officers on the way to [[Vienna]], 1,030 officers died during  interrogations by the NKVD, 983 officers were ""passed along""; many of this group ended up in mines in the [[Ural Mountains | Urals]], deprived of the right to come out to the surface of the earth.
 
-On [[1 June]] [[1945]] the Cossack camp in Linz held 32,000 persons, mainly old men, women, and children who were in fact refugees, but also including Cossack soldiers. On that day the camp handed over about 25,000 people to the Soviets. Even after the specified period of the delivery of prisoners, Soviet military missions made unexpected raids on Displaced Persons camps in the American and British zones, and took from them many people by force. In all, the Western allies handed over more than 150,000 Cossacks to the USSR.

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.

 In the [[Russia]]n Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a commune, and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jews]]) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 
 
-Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests.

They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows:

 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks, who greeted the Germans as liberators. The entire populations of towns, villages and settlements went out to meet the German troops with flowers and gifts of all kinds, singing their national anthems. Cossack formations of the [[Red Army]] would come over to the Germans in a body; new formations would spring up, apparently from nowhere, in traditional uniform and armed with swords, pistols, daggers, and rifles that had remained buried for years. One of the most famous Cossack leaders, ataman [[Kulakov]], believed dead since 1919, came out of hiding and, accompanied by hundreds of supporters, made a triumphant drive into [[Poltava]].

Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 In the [[Russia]]n Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban River|Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the [[mir (social)|mir]], but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 
 
-All Cossack males had to perform military service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.

They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own [[uniform]], equipment and [[horse]] (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. 
 
 Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18-26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.
 
-In [[1893]] the Cossacks had a total population of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres (593,000 km&sup2;) of land, including 105,000,000 acres (425,000 km&sup2;) of arable land and 9,400,000 acres (38,000 km&sup2;) under forests. Each ''stanitsa'' controlled a share of the land, divided up at the rate of 81 acres (328,000 m&sup2;) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, ''in lieu'' of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits for gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.

-In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos had to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take up arms.

Cossack formations of the [[Red Army]] would come over to the Germans in a body; new formations would spring up, apparently from nowhere, in traditional uniform and armed with swords, pistols, daggers, and rifles that had remained buried for years.

The division soon expanded into the 15th [[SS]] Cossack Cavalry Corps, which numbered some 50,000 men. Afterwards, two Cossack brigades and 12 Cossack reserve regiments formed, and a number of smaller units became attached to German formations.

 Note that the granting of the ""SS"" status to the Cossack Corps came about through [[Heinrich Himmler | Himmler]]'s policy, quite often applied, of barring the [[Wehrmacht]]'s influence in the political concerns of non-German formations. The Germans used the Cossacks to fight Soviet partisans, to cover the rear of their armies, and sometimes for action on the front. Later on, some Cossack formations moved to [[France]] and to [[Yugoslavia]]. The Cossack command objected, on the ground that the Cossacks should fight only against the Soviets, but in vain.

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.

+== Early Cossacks history ==
+
+Cossacks came to existance in the territories of today's [[Ukraine]] around [[13th century]], as a result of [[Human migration#The Great Migrations|early medieval migrations of peoples in Europe]].
+
+[[Byzantine]] writers of the [[10th century]] first mentioned the Cossacks and described them as a separate people who lived on the [[river Don]]. In [[1261]] their [[tribe]s living in the area between the rivers [[Dniester]] and the [[Volga]] were described for the first time in Russian chronicles. 
+
+In all historical records of that period the Cossacks society was described as lose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate and mostly independent from any other local countries (like [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or [[Tatar]]s).
+
+In the [[16th century]] these Cossack tribes merged into two large nations: 
+* [[Zaporojie]], on the lower bends of the river Dnieper, between Russia, Poland and the Tartars of the Crimea; 
+* [[Don Cossack State]], on the river Don, separating the then weak Russian State from the Mongol and Tartar tribes, vassals of Ottoman Empire. 
+
 == Cossacks in  Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ==
-''to be written''
+
+Numerous historical documents of that period contain refer to those states as sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, which important source of income were raids and pillages of their neigbours. They were renown for their raids against [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they didn't shy from pillagin other neigbours. Their actions increased the tention at southern border of the [Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost-constant low-level warfare taking place in that territories for almost entire existance of the Commonwealth. 
+
+In 1539 [[Czar]] [[Vasili_III_of_Russia|Vasili The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied. ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please. In 1549 the famous Czar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use Cossacks warmongering for its own puprposes. Cossacks on their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equaly, although in the [[16th century]] with Commonwealth dominance extending south the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

+Cossacks numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporoijam Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded Cossacks their once fairly strong loyality towards the Commonwealth. Cossacks attempts to get recognized as equal to szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into Three Nations (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward thinking man. Dissipating loyality and many szlachta arrogance in treating proud as peasants Cossacks resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early [[17th century]]. Largest of them was the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge]] is considered to be one of events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising freed Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them servants of the [[Russian Empire]].

""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please. In 1549 the famous Czar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use Cossacks warmongering for its own puprposes. Cossacks on their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equaly, although in the [[16th century]] with Commonwealth dominance extending south the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

'''Cossacks in Imperial Russia'''

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.

 In 1539 [[Czar]] [[Vasili_III_of_Russia|Vasili The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied. ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please. In 1549 the famous Czar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use Cossacks warmongering for its own puprposes. Cossacks on their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equaly, although in the [[16th century]] with Commonwealth dominance extending south the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.

+The attack launched by [[Germany|German]] units on the [[Soviet]] Union on [[22 June]]  [[1941]] caused a wave of an enthusiasm among the Cossaks. This stemmed from their generally-known hatred of the communists. As early as the middle of 1942, a Cossack cavalry formation existed in German controlled [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], under the command of a former Soviet major, Kononov, who had crossed over to the Germans at the first opportunity with the greater part of his regiment, and began service on the side of the Germans by guarding the line of communications against [[Soviet]] partisans.

+In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks, who greeted the Germans as liberators. The entire populations of towns, villages and settlements went out to meet the German troops with flowers and gifts of all kinds, singing their national anthems. Cossack formations of the [[Red Army]] would come over to the Germans in a body; new formations would spring up, apparently from nowhere, in traditional uniform and armed with swords, pistols, daggers, and rifles that had remained buried for years. One of the most famous Cossack leaders, ataman [[Kulakov]], believed dead since 1919, came out of hiding and, accompanied by hundreds of supporters, made a triumphant drive into [[Poltava]].

+The [[Cossack National Movement of Liberation]], whose aim was the rebuilding of an independent Cossack state, fostered the recruiting of Cossacks for the fight against the Soviets. The summer of 1943 saw the formation of the 1st Cossack Division, under the command of the German general [[Helmut von Pannwitz]]. The division soon expanded into the 15th [[SS]] Cossack Cavalry Corps, which numbered some 50,000 men.

+Note that the granting of the ""SS"" status to the Cossack Corps came about through [[Heinrich Himmler | Himmler]]'s policy, quite often applied, of barring the [[Wehrmacht]]'s influence in the political concerns of non-German formations. The Germans used the Cossacks to fight Soviet partisans, to cover the rear of their armies, and sometimes for action on the front. Later on, some Cossack formations moved to [[France]] and to [[Yugoslavia]]. The Cossack command objected, on the ground that the Cossacks should fight only against the Soviets, but in vain.

 In 1539 [[Czar]] [[Vasili_III_of_Russia|Vasili The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied. ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please. In 1549 the famous Czar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use Cossacks warmongering for its own puprposes. Cossacks on their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equaly, although in the [[16th century]] with Commonwealth dominance extending south the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

 Cossacks numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporoijam Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded Cossacks their once fairly strong loyality towards the Commonwealth. Cossacks attempts to get recognized as equal to szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into Three Nations (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward thinking man. Dissipating loyalty and arrogance of many from [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early [[17th century]]. Largest of them was the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge]] is considered to be one of events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising freed Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them servants of the [[Russian Empire]].

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

They were renown for their raids against [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they didn't shy from pillaging other neigbours.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please. In 1549 the famous Czar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use Cossacks warmongering for its own purposes. Cossacks on their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equaly, although in the [[16th century]] with Commonwealth dominance extending south the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 Numerous historical documents of that period contain refer to the cossacks as sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, of which important source of income were raids and pillages of their neigbours. They were renown for their raids against [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they didn't shy from pillaging other neigbours. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in an almost-constant low-level warfare taking place in those territories for almost entire existence of the Commonwealth.

 Cossacks numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporoijam Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded Cossacks their once fairly strong loyality towards the Commonwealth. Cossacks attempts to get recognized as equal to szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into Three Nations (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward thinking man. Dissipating loyalty and arrogance of many from [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early [[17th century]]. Largest of them was the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge]] is considered to be one of events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth.

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows:

 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks, who greeted the Germans as liberators. The entire populations of towns, villages and settlements went out to meet the German troops with flowers and gifts of all kinds, singing their national anthems. Cossack formations of the [[Red Army]] would come over to the Germans in a body; new formations would spring up, apparently from nowhere, in traditional uniform and armed with [[sword]]s, [[pistol]]s, [[dagger]]s, and [[rifle]]s that had remained buried for years. One of the most famous Cossack leaders, ataman [[Kulakov]], believed dead since [[1919]], came out of hiding and, accompanied by hundreds of supporters, made a triumphant drive into [[Poltava]].

 Numerous historical documents of that period contain refer to the cossacks as sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, of which important source of income were raids and pillages of their neigbours. They were renown for their raids against [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they didn't shy from pillaging other neigbours. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in an almost-constant low-level warfare taking place in those territories for almost entire existance of the Commonwealth.

Cossacks attempts to get recognized as equal to szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into Three Nations (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward thinking man.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows:

 Cossacks numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporozhian Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded Cossacks their once fairly strong loyality towards the Commonwealth. Cossacks attempts to get recognized as equal to szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into Three Nations (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward-thinking men, although the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was formally recognized as a nation in 1649. Dissipating loyalty and arrogance of many from [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early [[17th century]]. Largest of them was the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge]] is considered to be one of events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising freed Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in [[1667]] under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

 After this point, the Cossack nation of the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was divided into two semiautonomous republics of [[Muscovy]]: the [[Cossack Hetmanate |Hetmanate]] on the Dnieper's left bank, and the more independent [[Zaporozhia]] to the south.

The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

 In the [[Russia]]n Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], [[Kuban Cossacks]], [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the [[Yenisey Cossack Host]] and [[Irkutsk]] Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in [[1917]]. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the [[mir (social)|mir]], but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).

 In 1539 [[Czar]] [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied. ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please. In 1549 the famous Czar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use Cossacks warmongering for its own purposes. Cossacks on their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally, although in the [[16th century]] with Commonwealth dominance extending south the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

 Cossacks numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporozhian Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded the Cossacks fairly strong loyalty they once had towards the Commonwealth. Cossacks attempts to get recognized as equal to szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into Three Nations (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward-thinking men, although the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was formally recognized as a nation in 1649. Dissipating loyalty and arrogance of many from [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early [[17th century]]. Largest of them was the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge]] is considered to be one of events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising freed Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in [[1667]] under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 After this point, the Cossack nation of the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was divided into two semiautonomous republics of [[Muscovy]]: the [[Cossack Hetmanate |Hetmanate]] on the Dnieper's left bank, and the more independent [[Zaporozhia]] to the south.

 In 1539 [[Czar]] [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the famous Czar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally, although in the [[16th century]], with Commonwealth dominance extending south, the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

 == Cossacks in World War II ==
 
-The attack launched by [[Germany|German]] units on the [[Soviet Union]] on [[22 June]]  [[1941]] produced a wave of enthusiasm among the Cossaks. This stemmed from their generally-known hatred of the [[communism | communist]]s. As early as the middle of [[1942]], a Cossack cavalry formation existed in German-controlled [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], under the command of a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] major, Ivan Kononov, who had crossed over to the Germans on [[22 August]] [[1941]] with the greater part of his 436th regiment, and began service on the side of the Germans by guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
+When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for Soviet Union, however some chose to settle old scores by colaborating with the Germans. Especially after the Soviet Unions initial series of defeats, such as the army of Ivan Kononov, a former soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
 
-In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks, who greeted the Germans as liberators. The entire populations of towns, villages and settlements went out to meet the German troops with flowers and gifts of all kinds, singing their national anthems. Cossack formations of the [[Red Army]] would come over to the Germans in a body; new formations would spring up, apparently from nowhere, in traditional uniform and armed with [[sword]]s, [[pistol]]s, [[dagger]]s, and [[rifle]]s that had remained buried for years. One of the most famous Cossack leaders, ataman [[Kulakov]], believed dead since [[1919]], came out of hiding and, accompanied by hundreds of supporters, made a triumphant drive into [[Poltava]]. 
 
-The [[Cossack National Movement of Liberation]], which had the aim of rebuilding an independent Cossack state, fostered the recruiting of Cossacks for the fight against the Soviets. The summer of [[1943]] saw the formation of the '''1st Cossack Division''', under the command of the German [[Lieutenant General]] [[Helmut von Pannwitz]]. The division soon expanded into the '''15th [[SS]] Cossack Cavalry Corps''' (), which numbered some 50,000 men. Afterwards, two Cossack brigades and 12 Cossack reserve regiments formed, and a number of smaller units became attached to German formations. In all, Cossack troops on the German side numbered about 250,000 men. 
+In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks, there in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge the Communists. Occasions have been when relatives separated by the Russian Civil war met each other on different sides and ruthlessly killed.
 
-Note that the granting of the ""SS"" status to the Cossack Corps came about through [[Heinrich Himmler | Himmler]]'s policy, quite often applied, of barring the [[Wehrmacht]]'s influence in the political concerns of non-German formations. The Germans used the Cossacks to fight Soviet partisans, to cover the rear of their armies, and sometimes for action on the front. Later on, some Cossack formations moved to [[France]] and to [[Yugoslavia]]. The Cossack command objected, on the ground that the Cossacks should fight only against the Soviets, but in vain.
+During the Battle of Stalingrad Cossacks were able to fully justify their reincarnation in 1936. Attacks, some led by the legendary Semyon Budenny, were able to keep the Germans from piercing the Caucausus, where particulary the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to keep prevent the Germans from taking the mountains.
 
-The 2nd [[KONR]] Division split into two parts; the greater part, together with the Cossack Corps of General von Pannwitz, surrendered to the British on [[12 May]] [[1945]], in [[Austria]], and went into internment in the area of [[Klagenfurt]] - [[Sankt Veit]]. One regiment of the 2nd Division and the Army's Headquarters reached the American zone after a long and weary journey, and went into internment at [[Landau]], in western [[Bavaria]].
+Failing to overcome the Cossacks for self liberation and the useless propaganda about the independent Cossack state, the Germans turned their attention to the indegious mountain dwellers of the Caucasus. This violence of ethnic instability was ended only when the Soviet Union deported entire populations of Karachevs, Balkars, Ingush and Chechens and the Cossacks were once again able to live in their native land. 
 
-On [[27 May]] [[1945]], in accordance with the agreement signed in Vienna by British and Soviet authorities, the British began to hand over to the Soviets the interned soldiers of the Eastern formations as well as the Cossacks. On that day, in Graz, they handed over the generals von Pannwitz, [[Pyotr Krasnov]], and [[Andrei Shkuro]]. All three hoped to the last that they would escape this fate, for von Pannwitz held German nationality, and the other two had emigrated from Tsarist Russia and had never held Soviet citizenship.
+From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in southern part of the front, where their use in recconaisance and logistics proved invaluble. Many went on through Romania and into the Balkans during the final stages of the war. 
 
-On [[28 May]] [[1945]] the local British commander invited to a conference  in the little town of Spittal in Austria the entire officer corps from the Cossack camp: 35 generals, 167 colonels, 283 lieutenant-colonels, 375 captains, 1,752 subalterns, 136 military functionaries and doctors, two chaplains, two band leaders, two photographers, and two interpreters: in all 2,756 persons. At the time of the departure from the camp, 2,201 Cossacks reported ready for the journey, the remainder having refused to board the trucks, or having disappeared. On the way to [[Linz]], 55 of them committed suicide; the [[NKVD]] took 2,146 into custody. The prisoners included 1,856 Cossack officers, 176 Russians, 63 Ukrainians, 31 Caucasians, and a handful of other nationals. As to the fate of those delivered: 12 generals went to Moscow, Soviet soldiers of the convoy shot 120 officers on the way to [[Vienna]], 1,030 officers died during  interrogations by the NKVD, 983 officers were ""passed along""; many of this group ended up in mines in the [[Ural Mountains | Urals]], deprived of the right to come out to the surface of the earth.
+For the collaborators their options were thin. It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, which some say are over 250000 (although more realistic current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that). Most of the collaborators were the Don Cossacks, which foremely being the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet Collectivisation policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other had, fought almost exclussively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on the Red Square in the famous Victory Parade. For the Collaborators, many fled the Soviet Advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied agreements thousands were handed over to the USSR. Surprisingly, following the death of Stalin, a large portions of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991 could they openely mourn their lost ones.
 
-On [[1 June]] [[1945]] the Cossack camp in Linz held 32,000 persons, mainly old men, women, and children -- genuine refugees -- but also including Cossack soldiers. On that day the camp handed over about 25,000 people to the Soviets. Even after the specified period of the delivery of prisoners, Soviet military missions made unexpected raids on Displaced Persons camps in the American and British zones, and took from them many people by force. In all, the Western allies handed over more than 150,000 Cossacks to the USSR.
-
-The statement of a Cossack emigrant quotes the impressions of a British sailor given here without alteration: 
-
-""I took part in the [[Battle of Dunkirk|evacuation of Dunkirk]]. Our soldiers felt very badly. I helped to fish out Germans from the sunken [[German battleship Bismarck | ''Bismarck'']], which received the greatest number of torpedoes in history. I saw the population of [[Malta]] sitting in the cellars for many weeks. I saw Malta being bombed incessantly and deafened by explosions of bombs and shells. They were exhausted from constant explosions and alarms. I lived through the sinking of my own ship. I know about jumping into the water at night, dark and without bottom, and the terrifying shouts for help of the drowning, and then the boat, and looking for the rescue ship. It was a nightmare. I drove German prisoners captured during the invasion of [[Normandy]]. They were almost dying from fear. But all that is nothing. The real, terrible, unspeakable fear I saw during the convoying and repatriation of people to Soviet Russia. They were becoming white, green and grey with the fear that took hold of them. When we arrived at the port and were handing them over to the Russians, the repatriates were fainting and losing their senses. And only now I know what a man's fear is who lived through hell, and that it is nothing compared to the fear of a man who is returning to the Soviet hell.""

The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks, who greeted the Germans as liberators. The entire populations of towns, villages and settlements went out to meet the German troops with flowers and gifts of all kinds, singing their national anthems. Cossack formations of the [[Red Army]] would come over to the Germans in a body; new formations would spring up, apparently from nowhere, in traditional uniform and armed with [[sword]]s, [[pistol]]s, [[dagger]]s, and [[rifle]]s that had remained buried for years. One of the most famous Cossack leaders, ataman [[Kulakov]], believed dead since [[1919]], came out of hiding and, accompanied by hundreds of supporters, made a triumphant drive into [[Poltava]]. 
 
-The [[Cossack National Movement of Liberation]], which had the aim of rebuilding an independent Cossack state, fostered the recruiting of Cossacks for the fight against the Soviets. The summer of [[1943]] saw the formation of the 1st Cossack Division, under the command of the German general [[Helmut von Pannwitz]]. The division soon expanded into the 15th [[SS]] Cossack Cavalry Corps, which numbered some 50,000 men. Afterwards, two Cossack brigades and 12 Cossack reserve regiments formed, and a number of smaller units became attached to German formations. In all, Cossack troops on the German side numbered about 250,000 men.

The Germans used the Cossacks to fight Soviet partisans, to cover the rear of their armies, and sometimes for action on the front. Later on, some Cossack formations moved to [[France]] and to [[Yugoslavia]]. The Cossack command objected, on the ground that the Cossacks should fight only against the Soviets, but in vain.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms.

 Cossacks numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporozhian Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded Cossacks their once fairly strong loyality towards the Commonwealth. Cossacks attempts to get recognized as equal to szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into Three Nations (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward-thinking men, although the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was formally recognized as a nation in 1649. Dissipating loyalty and arrogance of many from [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early [[17th century]]. Largest of them was the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge]] is considered to be one of events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising freed Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in [[1667]] under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.

 In 1539 [[Czar]] [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the famous Czar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally, although in the [[16th century]], with Commonwealth dominance extending south, the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration.

In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 Failing to overcome the Cossacks by their useless propaganda about an independent Cossack state, the Germans turned their attention to the indigenous mountain dwellers of the Caucasus. This violent ethnic instability was ended only when the Soviet Union deported entire populations of Karachevs, Balkars, Ingush and Chechens and the Cossacks were once again able to live in their native land. 
 
 From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaisance and logistics proved invaluble. Many went on through Romania and into the Balkans during the final stages of the war.

-== Early Cossack history ==
-
-The [[Cossack]]s came to existence in the territories of today's [[Ukraine]], around the [[13th century]], as a result of [[Human migration#The Great Migrations|early medieval migrations of peoples in Europe]].
-
-[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] writers of the [[10th century]] first mentioned the Cossacks and described them as a separate people who lived on the [[Don River, Russia|river Don]]. In [[1261]] these people living in the area between the rivers [[Dniester]] and the [[Volga]] were described for the first time in Russian chronicles. 
-
-In all historical records of that period Cossack society was described as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of, other nations (such [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or [[Tatar]]s).
-
-In the [[16th century]] these Cossack societies created two relatively independent territorial organisations: 
-* [[Zaporizhia]] ([[Zaporozhie]]), on the lower bends of the river Dnieper, between Russia, Poland and the Tatars of the Crimea, with the center, [[Zaporizhian Sich]]; 
-* The [[Don Cossack State]], on the river Don, separating the then weak Russian State from the [[Mongol]] and Tatar tribes, vassals of Ottoman Empire.
-
-== Cossacks in  Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ==
-
-Numerous historical documents of that period contain refer to the cossacks as sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neigbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neigbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth. 
-[[Image:Powrot Kozakow.jpg|thumb|left|300px|""The Return of the [[Cossacks]]"" oil on canvas, 1894, 61 x 120 cm, painted by [[Józef Brandt]].]]
-
-In 1539 [[Czar]] [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the famous Czar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally, although in the [[16th century]], with Commonwealth dominance extending south, the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

-
-The Cossacks' numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporozhian Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into Three Nations (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward-thinking men, although the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was formally recognized as a nation in 1649. Dissipating loyalty and the arrogance of many from the [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early [[17th century]]. The largest of them was the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising freed Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in [[1667]] under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].
-
-== Ukraine and Muscovy ==
-
-After this point, the Cossack nation of the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was divided into two semiautonomous republics of [[Muscovy]]: the [[Cossack Hetmanate |Hetmanate]] on the Dnieper's left bank, and the more independent [[Zaporozhia]] to the south.  A Cossack organization was also established in the Muscovite colony of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].  
-
-These organizations gradually lost their independence, and were abolished by [[Catherine II]] by the late 18th century.  The Hemanate became the governorship of [[Little Russia]], and Sloboda Ukraine the [[Kharkiv province]].  After having its capital, the [[Zaporozhian Sich |Sich]], destroyed and relocated more than once, Zaporozhia was absorbed into [[New Russia]].
-
-The Cossacks that wanted to continue their lifestyle moved to the [[Kuban]], where they live to date (see [[Kuban Cossacks]])
-
-== Cossacks in Imperial Russia ==
-''This section derives originally from the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]''
-
-In the [[Russia]]n Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], [[Kuban Cossacks]], [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the [[Yenisey Cossack Host]] and [[Irkutsk]] Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in [[1917]]. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the [[mir (social)|mir]], but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 
-
-All Cossack males had to perform [[military]] service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own [[uniform]], equipment and [[horse]] (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. 
-
-Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18-26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all [[Cossack voisko]]s had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

-In [[1893]] the Cossacks had a total population of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres (593,000 km²) of land, including 105,000,000 acres (425,000 km²) of arable land and 9,400,000 acres (38,000 km²) under forests. Each ''stanitsa'' controlled a share of the land, divided up at the rate of 81 acres (328,000 m²) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, ''in lieu'' of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, [[Fishery|fisheries]], permits for [[gold]]-[[mining|digging]], etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 
-
-In time of [[war]] the ten Cossack voiskos had to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of [[peace]] they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take up arms. 
-
-As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more [[school]]s and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to [[agriculture]], which (with the exception of the Ussuri Cossacks) sufficed to supply their needs and usually to leave a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse [[breeding]], [[vine]] culture in the [[Caucasus]], fishing on the [[Don River, Russia | Don]], the [[Ural River | Ural]], and the [[Caspian Sea]], [[hunting]], [[beekeeping]], etc. The Cossacks mostly rented out rights to extract [[coal]], gold and other [[mineral]]s found on their territories to strangers, who also owned most factories.
-
-The Tsarist authorities also introduced a military organization similar to that of the Cossacks into certain non-Cossack districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I comprised: 
-
-* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
-* [[Kuban]] [[Circassians]], one sotnia.
-* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
-* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
-* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
-* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
-
-In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

-== Cossacks in World War II ==
-
-When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
-
-
-In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.
-
-During the Battle of Stalingrad Cossacks were able to fully justify their reincarnation in 1936. Attacks, some led by the legendary Semyon Budenny, were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains.
-
-Failing to overcome the Cossacks by their useless propaganda about an independent Cossack state, the Germans turned their attention to the indigenous mountain dwellers of the Caucasus. This violent ethnic instability was ended only when the Soviet Union deported entire populations of Karachevs, Balkars, Ingush and Chechens and the Cossacks were once again able to live in their native land. 
-
-From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaisance and logistics proved invaluble. Many went on through Romania and into the Balkans during the final stages of the war. 
-
-For the collaborators their options were thin. It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although more realistic current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on Red Square in the famous Victory Parade. Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied agreements thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Surprisingly, following the death of Stalin, large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.
-
-The division of the Cossacks in the Russian Civil War and the Second World War continues to be a controversial issue today.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 In 1539 [[Czar]] [[Vasili_III_of_Russia|Vasili The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied. ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please. In 1549 the famous Czar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use Cossacks warmongering for its own purposes. Cossacks on their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally, although in the [[16th century]] with Commonwealth dominance extending south the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

-Cossacks numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 In 1539 [[Czar]] [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the famous Czar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally, although in the [[16th century]], with Commonwealth dominance extending south, the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes.

 Failing to overcome the Cossacks by their useless propaganda about an independent Cossack state, the Germans turned their attention to the indigenous mountain dwellers of the Caucasus. This violent ethnic instability was ended only when the Soviet Union deported entire populations of Karachevs, Balkars, Ingush and Chechens and the Cossacks were once again able to live in their native land. 
 
-From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaisance and logistics proved invaluble. Many went on through Romania and into the Balkans during the final stages of the war.

-For the collaborators their options were thin. It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although more realistic current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on Red Square in the famous Victory Parade.

 Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied agreements thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Surprisingly, following the death of Stalin, large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.

'''Cossacks in Imperial Russia'''

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 In all historical records of that period Cossack society was described as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of, other nations (such [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or [[Tatar]]s).
 
 In the 16th century these Cossack societies created two relatively independent territorial organisations:

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18.

They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

 Numerous historical documents of that period contain refer to the Cossacks as sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

Every Cossack had to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. 
 
 Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18-26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all [[Cossack voisko]]s had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos.

Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 
 
-In time of [[war]] the ten Cossack voiskos had to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of [[peace]] they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take up arms.

 When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].

 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses.

Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

+
+== Early Cossack history ==
+
+The [[Cossack]]s came to existence in the territories of today's [[Ukraine]], around the [[13th century]], as a result of [[Human migration#The Great Migrations|early medieval migrations of peoples in Europe]].
+
+[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] writers of the [[10th century]] first mentioned the Cossacks and described them as a separate people who lived on the [[Don River, Russia|river Don]]. In [[1261]] these people living in the area between the rivers [[Dniester]] and the [[Volga]] were described for the first time in Russian chronicles. 
+
+In all historical records of that period Cossack society was described as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of, other nations (such [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or [[Tatar]]s).
+
+In the [[16th century]] these Cossack societies created two relatively independent territorial organisations: 
+* [[Zaporizhia]] ([[Zaporozhie]]), on the lower bends of the river Dnieper, between Russia, Poland and the Tatars of the Crimea, with the center, [[Zaporizhian Sich]]; 
+* The [[Don Cossack State]], on the river Don, separating the then weak Russian State from the [[Mongol]] and Tatar tribes, vassals of Ottoman Empire.
+
+== Cossacks in  Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ==
+
+Numerous historical documents of that period contain refer to the cossacks as sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neigbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neigbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth. 
+[[Image:Powrot Kozakow.jpg|thumb|left|300px|""The Return of the [[Cossacks]]"" oil on canvas, 1894, 61 x 120 cm, painted by [[Józef Brandt]].]]
+
+In 1539 [[Czar]] [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the famous Czar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally, although in the [[16th century]], with Commonwealth dominance extending south, the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

+
+The Cossacks' numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporozhian Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into Three Nations (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward-thinking men, although the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was formally recognized as a nation in 1649. Dissipating loyalty and the arrogance of many from the [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early [[17th century]]. The largest of them was the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising freed Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in [[1667]] under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].
+
+== Ukraine and Muscovy ==
+
+After this point, the Cossack nation of the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was divided into two semiautonomous republics of [[Muscovy]]: the [[Cossack Hetmanate |Hetmanate]] on the Dnieper's left bank, and the more independent [[Zaporozhia]] to the south.  A Cossack organization was also established in the Muscovite colony of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].  
+
+These organizations gradually lost their independence, and were abolished by [[Catherine II]] by the late 18th century.  The Hemanate became the governorship of [[Little Russia]], and Sloboda Ukraine the [[Kharkiv province]].  After having its capital, the [[Zaporozhian Sich |Sich]], destroyed and relocated more than once, Zaporozhia was absorbed into [[New Russia]].
+
+The Cossacks that wanted to continue their lifestyle moved to the [[Kuban]], where they live to date (see [[Kuban Cossacks]])
+
+== Cossacks in Imperial Russia ==
+''This section derives originally from the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]''
+
+In the [[Russia]]n Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], [[Kuban Cossacks]], [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the [[Yenisey Cossack Host]] and [[Irkutsk]] Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in [[1917]]. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the [[mir (social)|mir]], but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 
+
+All Cossack males had to perform [[military]] service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own [[uniform]], equipment and [[horse]] (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. 
+
+Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18-26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all [[Cossack voisko]]s had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.
+
+In [[1893]] the Cossacks had a total population of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres (593,000 km²) of land, including 105,000,000 acres (425,000 km²) of arable land and 9,400,000 acres (38,000 km²) under forests. Each ''stanitsa'' controlled a share of the land, divided up at the rate of 81 acres (328,000 m²) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, ''in lieu'' of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, [[Fishery|fisheries]], permits for [[gold]]-[[mining|digging]], etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 
+
+In time of [[war]] the ten Cossack voiskos had to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of [[peace]] they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take up arms. 
+
+As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more [[school]]s and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to [[agriculture]], which (with the exception of the Ussuri Cossacks) sufficed to supply their needs and usually to leave a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse [[breeding]], [[vine]] culture in the [[Caucasus]], fishing on the [[Don River, Russia | Don]], the [[Ural River | Ural]], and the [[Caspian Sea]], [[hunting]], [[beekeeping]], etc. The Cossacks mostly rented out rights to extract [[coal]], gold and other [[mineral]]s found on their territories to strangers, who also owned most factories.
+
+The Tsarist authorities also introduced a military organization similar to that of the Cossacks into certain non-Cossack districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I comprised: 
+
+* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
+* [[Kuban]] [[Circassians]], one sotnia.
+* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
+* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
+* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
+* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
+
+In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

+== Cossacks in World War II ==
+
+When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
+
+
+In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.
+
+During the Battle of Stalingrad Cossacks were able to fully justify their reincarnation in 1936. Attacks, some led by the legendary Semyon Budenny, were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains.
+
+Failing to overcome the Cossacks by their useless propaganda about an independent Cossack state, the Germans turned their attention to the indigenous mountain dwellers of the Caucasus. This violent ethnic instability was ended only when the Soviet Union deported entire populations of Karachevs, Balkars, Ingush and Chechens and the Cossacks were once again able to live in their native land. 
+
+From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaisance and logistics proved invaluble. Many went on through Romania and into the Balkans during the final stages of the war. 
+
+For the collaborators their options were thin. It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although more realistic current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on Red Square in the famous Victory Parade. Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied agreements thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Surprisingly, following the death of Stalin, large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.
+
+The division of the Cossacks in the Russian Civil War and the Second World War continues to be a controversial issue today.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 After 1400s Cossacks as an established and identifiable group emerged in all historical accounts. Rulers of [[Muscovy|Muscovite Russia]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] have employed the Cossacks as the mobile guards against the [[Tatar]] raids from the sourth in the territories of the present-day south-western Russia and southern Ukraine. Those early Cossacks seemed to have included a significant number of Tatar descendents judging from the records of their names. From mid-15th century the Cossacks are mosrtly mentioned with Russian and Ukrainian names.<ref name=Long>Philip Longworth, ''The Cossacks'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970, ISBN 0030818559</ref>

 In 1539 [[Czar]] [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the famous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally, although in the 16th century, with Commonwealth dominance extending south, the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

-The Cossacks' numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporozhian Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into [[Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward-thinking men, although the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was formally recognized as a nation in 1649. Dissipating loyalty and the arrogance of many from the [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising freed Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

-In the [[Russian Empire]] the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], [[Kuban Cossacks]], [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]].

The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization.

The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.

* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos.

The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 Failing to overcome the Cossacks by their useless propaganda about an independent Cossack state, the Germans turned their attention to the indigenous mountain dwellers of the Caucasus. This violent ethnic instability was ended only when the Soviet Union deported entire populations of Karachevs, Balkars, Ingush and Chechens and the Cossacks were once again able to live in their native land.

 For the collaborators their options were thin. It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although more realistic current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on Red Square in the famous Victory Parade.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses.

This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses.

 == The Russian Revolution and Cossacks ==
 {{section-stub}}
 In the Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Many officers and experienced Cossacks fought for the White Army, and some of the poorer ones joined the Red Army, including notable commanders like [[Semyon Budennyi]]. Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of [[Decossackization]] (''Raskazachivaniye'') took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as potential threat to the new regime. This mostly involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples. This was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest. According to Michael Kort, ""During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 3 million, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Cossacks"".<ref>Kort, Michael (2001).

 The Cossacks' numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporozhian Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into [[Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward-thinking men, although the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was formally recognized as a nation in 1649. Dissipating loyalty and the arrogance of many from the [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the Chmielnicki Uprising, which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising freed Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

 == The Russian Revolution and Cossacks ==
 {{section-stub}}
 In the Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Many officers and experienced Cossacks fought for the White Army, and some of the poorer ones joined the Red Army, including notable commanders like [[Semyon Budennyi]]. Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of [[Decossackization]] (''Raskazachivaniye'') took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as potential threat to the new regime. This mostly involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples. This was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest. According to Michael Kort, ""During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 3 million, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Cossacks"".<ref>Kort, Michael (2001).

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Cossacks as sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

-Numerous historical documents of that period contain refer to the Cossacks as sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

-In 1539 [[Czar]] [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the famous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally, although in the 16th century, with Commonwealth dominance extending south, the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

-The Cossacks' numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporozhian Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into [[Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward-thinking men, although the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was formally recognized as a nation in 1649. Dissipating loyalty and the arrogance of many from the [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the Chmielnicki Uprising, which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising freed Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

 After this point, the Cossack nation of the Zaporozhian Host was divided into two semiautonomous republics of [[Muscovy]]: the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] on the Dnieper's left bank, and the more independent [[Zaporozhia]] to the south.  A Cossack organization was also established in the Muscovite colony of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].  
 
-These organizations gradually lost their independence, and were abolished by [[Catherine II]] by the late 18th century. The Hetmanate became the governorship of [[Little Russia]], and Sloboda Ukraine the [[Kharkiv province]]. After having its capital, the [[Zaporozhian Sich|Sich]] as well as [[Baturyn]], destroyed and relocated more than once, Zaporozhia was absorbed into [[New Russia]].

-In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], Kuban Cossacks, [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the [[Yenisey Cossack Host]] and Irkutsk Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in 1917. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).

The officers came from the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades.

The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits for gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in 1893), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.

Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
 
-In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.

-During the Battle of Stalingrad Cossacks were able to fully justify their reincarnation in 1936. Attacks, some led by the legendary Semyon Budenny, were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains.

-Failing to overcome the Cossacks by their useless propaganda about an independent Cossack state, the Germans turned their attention to the indigenous mountain dwellers of the Caucasus. This violent ethnic instability was ended only when the Soviet Union deported entire populations of Karachevs, Balkars, Ingush and Chechens and the Cossacks were once again able to live in their native land.

-From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaissance and logistics proved invaluable. Many went on through Romania and into the Balkans during the final stages of the war.

-For the collaborators their options were thin. It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although more realistic current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on Red Square in the famous Victory Parade.

-Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied agreements thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Surprisingly, following the death of Stalin, large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.

 The division of the Cossacks in the Russian Civil War and the Second World War continues to be a controversial issue today.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 Most historians agree that the Cossacks people were of mixed ethnic origins: the people descended from Turks, Tatars, Russians, Ukrainians and others who settled or passed through the vast Steppe that stretches from Asia to southern Europe.<ref name=Newland>Samuel J Newland, ''Cossacks in the German Army, 1941-1945'', Routledge, 1991, ISBN 0-7146-3351-8</ref>
 
-After 1400 Cossacks as an established and identifiable group emerged in all historical accounts.  Rulers of [[Muscovy|Muscovite Russia]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] have employed the Cossacks as the mobile guards against the [[Tatar]] raids from the south in the territories of the present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine.  Those early Cossacks seemed to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants judging from the records of their names.  From mid-15th century the Cossacks are mostly mentioned with Russian and Ukrainian names.<ref name=Long>Philip Longworth, ''The Cossacks'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970, ISBN 0-03-081855-9</ref>

 In all historical records of that period Cossack society was described as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of, other nations (such as [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or Tatars).
 
-In the 16th century these Cossack societies created two relatively independent territorial organisations: 
-* [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporizhia]] (Zaporozhie), on the lower bends of the river Dnieper, between Russia, Poland and the Tatars of the Crimea, with the center, [[Zaporizhian Sich]];

 * The [[Don Cossack State]], on the river Don, separating the then weak Russian State from the [[Mongol]] and Tatar tribes, vassals of Ottoman Empire.

+== Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ==
+Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Cossacks as sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

-In 1539 [[Czar]] [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please.""  In 1549 the famous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge.""  Similar exchanges passed between  Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes.  The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally, although in the 16th century, with Commonwealth dominance extending south, the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

-The Cossacks' numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.  [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporozhian Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth.  The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into [[Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward-thinking men, although the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was formally recognized as a nation in 1649.   Dissipating loyalty and the arrogance of many from the [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century.  The largest of them was the Chmielnicki Uprising, which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth.  This uprising freed Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

 == Ukraine and Muscovy ==
+After this point, the Cossack nation of the Zaporozhian Host was divided into two semiautonomous republics of [[Muscovy]]: the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] on the Dnieper's left bank, and the more independent [[Zaporozhia]] to the south. A Cossack organization was also established in the Muscovite colony of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].

-These organizations gradually lost their independence, and were abolished by [[Catherine II]] by the late 18th century.  The Hetmanate became the governorship of [[Little Russia]], and Sloboda Ukraine the [[Kharkiv province]].  After having its capital, the [[Zaporozhian Sich|Sich]] as well as [[Baturyn]], destroyed and relocated more than once, Zaporozhia was absorbed into [[New Russia]].

 The Cossacks that wanted to continue their lifestyle moved to the Kuban, where they live to date (see [[Kuban Cossacks]])

-In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], Kuban Cossacks, [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the [[Yenisey Cossack Host]] and Irkutsk Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in 1917. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent.  The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly.  This assembly resembled the ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).

They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve.  Every Cossack had to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.

-In 1893 the Cossacks had a total population of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres (593,000 km²) of land, including 105,000,000 acres (425,000 km²) of arable land and 9,400,000 acres (38,000 km²) under forests.  Each ''stanitsa'' controlled a share of the land, divided up at the rate of 81 acres (328,000 m²) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, ''in lieu'' of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future.  The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits for gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in 1893), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration.  They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000.  Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration.  Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos.  The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.

-In the Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Many officers and experienced Cossacks fought for the White Army, and some of the poorer ones joined the Red Army, including notable commanders like [[Semyon Budennyi]]. Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of [[Decossackization]] (''Raskazachivaniye'') took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as potential threat to the new regime. This mostly involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples. This was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest.

+When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].

+In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.

Attacks, some led by the legendary Semyon Budenny, were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains.

This violent ethnic instability was ended only when the Soviet Union deported entire populations of Karachevs, Balkars, Ingush and Chechens and the Cossacks were once again able to live in their native land.

+From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaissance and logistics proved invaluable. Many went on through Romania and into the Balkans during the final stages of the war.

+For the collaborators their options were thin. It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although more realistic current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on Red Square in the famous Victory Parade.

-Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied agreements thousands of them were handed back to the USSR.  Surprisingly, following the death of Stalin, large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy.  Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.

 The division of the Cossacks in the Russian Civil War and the Second World War continues to be a controversial issue today.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Cossacks as sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

+Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakov]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acqusition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.  
+
 In 1539 Grand Prince [[Vasili III of Russia|Basil The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the famous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally, although in the 16th century, with Commonwealth dominance extending south, the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.
+
+Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys, that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.  
+
+By 1618 the Zaporozhians were members of the Anti-Turkish League, as Schaidachny transferred his seat of power to [[Kiev]], nominally under Polish control, but functionally independent.  The fighting qualities of the sea-going Cossacks was even admired in the Ottoman chronicles: ""One can safely say that in the entire world one cannot find a people more careless for their lives or having less fear of death; persons versed in navigation assert that because of thir skill and boldness in naval battles these bands are more dangerous than any other enemy.""
+
+In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.  An attempt by the Turks to blockade the [[Berezan Island]], and thus deny the Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616, the raiders going on to capture [[Kaffa]], which was burned down after all of the slaves were freed.  That same year [[Trebizond]], in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed.  Sultan [[Ahmed I]] sent his fleet to the Dneiper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Istanbul, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the [[Topkapi Palace]], according to one account.  The city was raided four more times, once in 1620 and no fewer than three times in 1624.

-The Cossacks' numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporozhian Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into [[Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward-thinking men, although the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was formally recognized as a nation in 1649. Dissipating loyalty and the arrogance of many from the [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the Chmielnicki Uprising, which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising freed Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 In all historical records of that period, Cossack society was described as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of, other nations (such as [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or the Tatars).
 
 In the 16th century, these Cossack societies created two relatively independent territorial organisations:

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Cossacks as sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

Similar exchanges passed between Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses).

 When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
 
-In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.

-Failing to overcome the Cossacks by their useless propaganda about an independent Cossack state, the Germans turned their attention to the indigenous mountain dwellers of the Caucasus. This violent ethnic instability was ended only when the Soviet Union deported entire populations of Karachevs, Balkars, Ingush and Chechens and the Cossacks were once again able to live in their native land.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms.

Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.

 After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years War]]. Their numbers expanded with  immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. [[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles or inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks, eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into [[Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view. After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the [[Zaporozhian Host]] gained control of parts of the Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades. 
 
-There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks as a sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although more realistic current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies.

The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.

 Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakov]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.  
 
-In 1539 Grand Prince [[Vasili III of Russia|Basil The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the famous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally, although in the 16th century, with Commonwealth dominance extending south, the Zaporoijan Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded as subjects of the Commonwealth.

 Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys, that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.  
 
-By 1618 the Zaporozhians were members of the Anti-Turkish League, as Schaidachny transferred his seat of power to [[Kiev]], nominally under Polish control, but functionally independent.  The fighting qualities of the sea-going Cossacks was even admired in the Ottoman chronicles: ""One can safely say that in the entire world one cannot find a people more careless for their lives or having less fear of death; persons versed in navigation assert that because of thir skill and boldness in naval battles these bands are more dangerous than any other enemy.""

 In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.  An attempt by the Turks to blockade the [[Berezan Island]], and thus deny the Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616, the raiders going on to capture [[Kaffa]], which was burned down after all of the slaves were freed.  That same year [[Trebizond]], in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed.  Sultan [[Ahmed I]] sent his fleet to the Dneiper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Istanbul, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the [[Topkapi Palace]], according to one account.  The city was raided four more times, once in 1620 and no fewer than three times in 1624.

-After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years War]]. Their numbers expanded with [[peasantry]] immigration from Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. [[Szlachta]] attempts to turn Zaporozhian Cossacks into [[serf]]s eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were constantly rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into [[Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a small minority of forward-thinking men, although the [[Zaporozhian Host]] was formally recognized as a nation in 1649.

-Dissipating loyalty and the arrogance of many from the [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising freed Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Russian Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

 In the Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Many officers and experienced Cossacks fought for the White Army, and some of the poorer ones joined the Red Army.
 Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of [[Decossackization]] (''Raskazachivaniye'') took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as a potential threat to the new regime. This involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples, but there were also arrests and violent repressions. This policy of resettlement was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest. According to Michael Kort, ""During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 3 million, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Cossacks"".<ref>Kort, Michael (2001).

 After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years War]]. Their numbers expanded with  immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. [[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles or inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks, eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into [[Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view. After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the [[Zaporozhian Host]] gained control of parts of the Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades.

The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests.

 Dissipating loyalty and the arrogance of many from the [[szlachta]] in treating proud Cossacks as peasants resulted in several uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

-
-In all historical records of that period, Cossack society was described as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of, other nations (such as [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or the Tatars).
-
-In the 16th century, these Cossack societies created two relatively independent territorial organisations:
-* [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporizhia]] (Zaporozhie), on the lower bends of the river Dnieper in Ukraine, between Russia, Poland and the Tatars of the Crimea, with the center, [[Zaporizhian Sich]];

-Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks as a sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

-
-Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakov]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.  
-
-In 1539 Grand Prince [[Vasili III of Russia|Basil The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the famous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally. In the 16th-17th century the Zaporoijan Cossacks were subjects of first the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and after the Union of Lublin of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
-
-Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys, that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.  
-
-By 1618 the Zaporozhians were members of the Anti-Turkish League, as Schaidachny transferred his seat of power to [[Kiev]], the Polish Crown's regional capital.  
-
-The fighting qualities of the sea-going Cossacks was even admired in the Ottoman chronicles: ""One can safely say that in the entire world one cannot find a people more careless for their lives or having less fear of death; persons versed in navigation assert that because of their skill and boldness in naval battles these bands are more dangerous than any other enemy."" {{Fact|date=October 2008}}
-
-In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.  An attempt by the Turks to blockade the [[Berezan Island]], and thus deny the Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616, the raiders going on to capture [[Kaffa]], which was burned down after all of the slaves were freed.  That same year [[Trebizond]], in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed.  Sultan [[Ahmed I]] sent his fleet to the Dneiper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Constantinople, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the [[Topkapi Palace]], according to one account.  The city was raided four more times, once in 1620 and no fewer than three times in 1624.

-
-After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years War]]. Their numbers expanded with  immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. [[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles or inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks, eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into [[Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view. After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the [[Zaporozhian Host]] gained control of parts of the Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades. 
-
-There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].
-
-== Ukraine and Russia ==
-After this point, the Cossack nation of the Zaporozhian Host was divided into two semiautonomous republics within the [[Russia|Russian state]]: the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] on the Dnieper's left bank, and the more independent [[Zaporozhia]] to the south. A Cossack organization was also established in the Russian colony of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].
-
-These organizations gradually lost their independence, and were abolished by [[Catherine II]] by the late 18th century. The Hetmanate became the governorship of [[Little Russia]], and Sloboda Ukraine the [[Kharkiv province]]. After having its capital, the [[Zaporozhian Sich|Sich]] as well as [[Baturyn]], destroyed and relocated more than once, Zaporozhia was absorbed into [[New Russia]].
-
-The Cossacks that wanted to continue their lifestyle moved to Ottoman-controlled territies on the Danube or to the Kuban, where they live to this date (see [[Kuban Cossacks]])

-
-In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], Kuban Cossacks, [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the [[Yenisey Cossack Host]] and Irkutsk Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in 1917. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).
-
-All Cossack males had to perform military service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.
-
-Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18-26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.
-
-In 1893 the Cossacks had a total population of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000&nbsp;acres (593,000&nbsp;km²) of land, including 105,000,000&nbsp;acres (425,000&nbsp;km²) of arable land and 9,400,000&nbsp;acres (38,000&nbsp;km²) under forests. Each ''stanitsa'' controlled a share of the land, divided up at the rate of 81&nbsp;acres (328,000&nbsp;m²) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, ''in lieu'' of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits for gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in 1893), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.

-In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos had to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take up arms.
-
-As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Ussuri Cossacks) sufficed to supply their needs and usually to leave a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in the [[Caucasus]], fishing on the [[Don River, Russia|Don]], the [[Ural River|Ural]], and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, beekeeping etc. The Cossacks mostly rented out rights to extract coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories to strangers, who also owned most factories.
-
-The Tsarist authorities also introduced a military organization similar to that of the Cossacks into certain non-Cossack districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I comprised:
-* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
-* Kuban [[Circassians]], one sotnia.
-* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
-* [[Kars, Turkey|Kars]], three sotnias.
-* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
-* [[Turkmen people|Turkomans]], three sotnias.

-In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

-In the Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Many officers and experienced Cossacks fought for the White Army, and some of the poorer ones joined the Red Army.
-Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of [[Decossackization]] (''Raskazachivaniye'') took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as a potential threat to the new regime. This involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples, but there were also arrests and violent repressions. This policy of resettlement was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest. According to Michael Kort, ""During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 3 million, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Cossacks"".<ref>Kort, Michael (2001).

-
-== World War II ==
-When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
-
-In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[POW]] camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.
-
-During the Battle of [[Stalingrad]], Cossacks were able to fully justify their reincarnation in 1936. Attacks, some led by [[Semyon Budenny]], were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains. Not only was the region rich in oil, but it was also the key to [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]].
-
-From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaissance and logistics proved invaluable. Many went on through [[Romania]] and into the [[Balkans]] during the final stages of the war.
-[[Image:KubanCossacks2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Kuban Cossacks, Victory Parade]]
-It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on [[Red Square]] in the famous Victory Parade.
-
-Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied [[Betrayal of the Cossacks|agreements]] thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Surprisingly, following the death of [[Stalin]], large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.
-
-The division of the Cossacks in the Russian Civil War and the Second World War continues to be a controversial issue today.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.

-
-It is after 1400 that the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of the present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine. Those early Cossacks seemed to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants judging from the records of their names. From the mid-15th century, the Cossacks are mostly mentioned with Russian and Ukrainian names.<ref name=Long>Philip Longworth, ''The Cossacks'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970, ISBN 0-03-081855-9</ref>
-
-In all historical records of that period, Cossack society was described as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of, other nations (such as [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or the Tatars).
-
-In the 16th century, these Cossack societies created two relatively independent territorial organisations:
-* [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporizhia]] (Zaporozhie), on the lower bends of the river Dnieper in Ukraine, between Russia, Poland and the Tatars of the Crimea, with the center, [[Zaporizhian Sich]];
-* The [[Don Cossack State]], on the river Don, separating the then weak Russian State from the [[Mongol]] and Tatar tribes, vassals of Ottoman Empire.
-
-== Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ==
-
-{{Main|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
-Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks as a sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.
-[[Image:Powrot Kozakow.jpg|thumb|left|300px|""The Return of the [[Cossacks]]"" oil on canvas, 1894, 61 x 120&nbsp;cm, painted by [[Józef Brandt]].]]
-
-Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakov]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.  
-
-In 1539 Grand Prince [[Vasili III of Russia|Basil The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the famous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally. In the 16th-17th century the Zaporoijan Cossacks were subjects of first the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and after the Union of Lublin of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
-
-Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys, that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.  
-
-By 1618 the Zaporozhians were members of the Anti-Turkish League, as Schaidachny transferred his seat of power to [[Kiev]], the Polish Crown's regional capital.  
-
-The fighting qualities of the sea-going Cossacks was even admired in the Ottoman chronicles: ""One can safely say that in the entire world one cannot find a people more careless for their lives or having less fear of death; persons versed in navigation assert that because of their skill and boldness in naval battles these bands are more dangerous than any other enemy."" {{Fact|date=October 2008}}
-
-In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.  An attempt by the Turks to blockade the [[Berezan Island]], and thus deny the Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616, the raiders going on to capture [[Kaffa]], which was burned down after all of the slaves were freed.  That same year [[Trebizond]], in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed.  Sultan [[Ahmed I]] sent his fleet to the Dneiper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Constantinople, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the [[Topkapi Palace]], according to one account.  The city was raided four more times, once in 1620 and no fewer than three times in 1624.

-
-After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years War]]. Their numbers expanded with  immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. [[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles or inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks, eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into [[Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view. After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the [[Zaporozhian Host]] gained control of parts of the Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades. 
-
-There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].
-
-== Ukraine and Russia ==
-After this point, the Cossack nation of the Zaporozhian Host was divided into two semiautonomous republics within the [[Russia|Russian state]]: the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] on the Dnieper's left bank, and the more independent [[Zaporozhia]] to the south. A Cossack organization was also established in the Russian colony of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].
-
-These organizations gradually lost their independence, and were abolished by [[Catherine II]] by the late 18th century. The Hetmanate became the governorship of [[Little Russia]], and Sloboda Ukraine the [[Kharkiv province]]. After having its capital, the [[Zaporozhian Sich|Sich]] as well as [[Baturyn]], destroyed and relocated more than once, Zaporozhia was absorbed into [[New Russia]].
-
-The Cossacks that wanted to continue their lifestyle moved to Ottoman-controlled territies on the Danube or to the Kuban, where they live to this date (see [[Kuban Cossacks]])

-In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], Kuban Cossacks, [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the [[Yenisey Cossack Host]] and Irkutsk Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in 1917. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).
-
-All Cossack males had to perform military service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.
-
-Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18-26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.
-
-In 1893 the Cossacks had a total population of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000&nbsp;acres (593,000&nbsp;km²) of land, including 105,000,000&nbsp;acres (425,000&nbsp;km²) of arable land and 9,400,000&nbsp;acres (38,000&nbsp;km²) under forests. Each ''stanitsa'' controlled a share of the land, divided up at the rate of 81&nbsp;acres (328,000&nbsp;m²) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, ''in lieu'' of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits for gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in 1893), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.
-
-In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos had to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take up arms.
-
-As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Ussuri Cossacks) sufficed to supply their needs and usually to leave a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in the [[Caucasus]], fishing on the [[Don River, Russia|Don]], the [[Ural River|Ural]], and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, beekeeping etc. The Cossacks mostly rented out rights to extract coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories to strangers, who also owned most factories.
-
-The Tsarist authorities also introduced a military organization similar to that of the Cossacks into certain non-Cossack districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I comprised:
-* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
-* Kuban [[Circassians]], one sotnia.
-* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
-* [[Kars, Turkey|Kars]], three sotnias.
-* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
-* [[Turkmen people|Turkomans]], three sotnias.

-In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

-{{Expand-section|date=June 2008}}
-In the Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Many officers and experienced Cossacks fought for the White Army, and some of the poorer ones joined the Red Army.
-Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of [[Decossackization]] (''Raskazachivaniye'') took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as a potential threat to the new regime. This involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples, but there were also arrests and violent repressions. This policy of resettlement was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest. According to Michael Kort, ""During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 3 million, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Cossacks"".<ref>Kort, Michael (2001).

ISBN 0-7656-0396-9.</ref> Including 45 thousand [[Terek Cossacks]].<ref>[[Pavel Polian]] - Forced migrations in USSR - [http://www.memo.ru/history/deport/add1.htm#_VPID_44 Retrieved on 5 February 2007]</ref>
-
-== World War II ==
-When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
-
-In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[POW]] camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.
-
-During the Battle of [[Stalingrad]], Cossacks were able to fully justify their reincarnation in 1936. Attacks, some led by [[Semyon Budenny]], were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains. Not only was the region rich in oil, but it was also the key to [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]].
-
-From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaissance and logistics proved invaluable. Many went on through [[Romania]] and into the [[Balkans]] during the final stages of the war.
-[[Image:KubanCossacks2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Kuban Cossacks, Victory Parade]]
-It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on [[Red Square]] in the famous Victory Parade.
-
-Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied [[Betrayal of the Cossacks|agreements]] thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Surprisingly, following the death of [[Stalin]], large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.
-
-The division of the Cossacks in the Russian Civil War and the Second World War continues to be a controversial issue today.

 It is after 1400 that the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of the present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine. Those early Cossacks seemed to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants judging from the records of their names. From the mid-15th century, the Cossacks are mostly mentioned with Russian and Ukrainian names.<ref name=Long>Philip Longworth, ''The Cossacks'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970, ISBN 0-03-081855-9</ref>

 Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakov]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses.

+
+It is after 1400 that the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of the present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine. Those early Cossacks seemed to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants judging from the records of their names. From the mid-15th century, the Cossacks are mostly mentioned with Russian and Ukrainian names.<ref name=Long>Philip Longworth, ''The Cossacks'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970, ISBN 0-03-081855-9</ref>
+
+In all historical records of that period, Cossack society was described as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of, other nations (such as [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or the Tatars).
+
+In the 16th century, these Cossack societies created two relatively independent territorial organisations:
+* [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporizhia]] (Zaporozhie), on the lower bends of the river Dnieper in Ukraine, between Russia, Poland and the Tatars of the Crimea, with the center, [[Zaporizhian Sich]];
+* The [[Don Cossack State]], on the river Don, separating the then weak Russian State from the [[Mongol]] and Tatar tribes, vassals of Ottoman Empire.
+
+== Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ==
+
+{{Main|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
+Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks as a sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.
+[[Image:Powrot Kozakow.jpg|thumb|left|300px|""The Return of the [[Cossacks]]"" oil on canvas, 1894, 61 x 120&nbsp;cm, painted by [[Józef Brandt]].]]
+
+Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakov]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.  
+
+In 1539 Grand Prince [[Vasili III of Russia|Basil The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the famous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally. In the 16th-17th century the Zaporoijan Cossacks were subjects of first the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and after the Union of Lublin of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
+
+Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys, that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.  
+
+By 1618 the Zaporozhians were members of the Anti-Turkish League, as Schaidachny transferred his seat of power to [[Kiev]], the Polish Crown's regional capital.  
+
+The fighting qualities of the sea-going Cossacks was even admired in the Ottoman chronicles: ""One can safely say that in the entire world one cannot find a people more careless for their lives or having less fear of death; persons versed in navigation assert that because of their skill and boldness in naval battles these bands are more dangerous than any other enemy."" {{Fact|date=October 2008}}
+
+In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.  An attempt by the Turks to blockade the [[Berezan Island]], and thus deny the Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616, the raiders going on to capture [[Kaffa]], which was burned down after all of the slaves were freed.  That same year [[Trebizond]], in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed.  Sultan [[Ahmed I]] sent his fleet to the Dneiper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Constantinople, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the [[Topkapi Palace]], according to one account.  The city was raided four more times, once in 1620 and no fewer than three times in 1624.

+
+After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years War]]. Their numbers expanded with  immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. [[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles or inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks, eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into [[Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view. After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the [[Zaporozhian Host]] gained control of parts of the Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades. 
+
+There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].
+
+== Ukraine and Russia ==
+After this point, the Cossack nation of the Zaporozhian Host was divided into two semiautonomous republics within the [[Russia|Russian state]]: the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] on the Dnieper's left bank, and the more independent [[Zaporozhia]] to the south. A Cossack organization was also established in the Russian colony of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].
+
+These organizations gradually lost their independence, and were abolished by [[Catherine II]] by the late 18th century. The Hetmanate became the governorship of [[Little Russia]], and Sloboda Ukraine the [[Kharkiv province]]. After having its capital, the [[Zaporozhian Sich|Sich]] as well as [[Baturyn]], destroyed and relocated more than once, Zaporozhia was absorbed into [[New Russia]].
+
+The Cossacks that wanted to continue their lifestyle moved to Ottoman-controlled territies on the Danube or to the Kuban, where they live to this date (see [[Kuban Cossacks]])
+
+== Imperial Russia ==
+''This section derives originally from the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]''
+
+In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], Kuban Cossacks, [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the [[Yenisey Cossack Host]] and Irkutsk Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in 1917. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).
+
+All Cossack males had to perform military service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.
+
+Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18-26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.
+
+In 1893 the Cossacks had a total population of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000&nbsp;acres (593,000&nbsp;km²) of land, including 105,000,000&nbsp;acres (425,000&nbsp;km²) of arable land and 9,400,000&nbsp;acres (38,000&nbsp;km²) under forests. Each ''stanitsa'' controlled a share of the land, divided up at the rate of 81&nbsp;acres (328,000&nbsp;m²) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, ''in lieu'' of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits for gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in 1893), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.
+
+In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos had to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take up arms.
+
+As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Ussuri Cossacks) sufficed to supply their needs and usually to leave a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in the [[Caucasus]], fishing on the [[Don River, Russia|Don]], the [[Ural River|Ural]], and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, beekeeping etc. The Cossacks mostly rented out rights to extract coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories to strangers, who also owned most factories.
+
+The Tsarist authorities also introduced a military organization similar to that of the Cossacks into certain non-Cossack districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I comprised:
+* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
+* Kuban [[Circassians]], one sotnia.
+* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
+* [[Kars, Turkey|Kars]], three sotnias.
+* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
+* [[Turkmen people|Turkomans]], three sotnias.
+
+In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.
+
+== Russian Revolution ==
+{{Expand-section|date=June 2008}}
+In the Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Many officers and experienced Cossacks fought for the White Army, and some of the poorer ones joined the Red Army.
+Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of [[Decossackization]] (''Raskazachivaniye'') took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as a potential threat to the new regime. This involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples, but there were also arrests and violent repressions. This policy of resettlement was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest. According to Michael Kort, ""During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 3 million, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Cossacks"".<ref>Kort, Michael (2001). ''The Soviet Colosus: History and Aftermath'', p. 133. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe. ISBN 0-7656-0396-9.</ref> Including 45 thousand [[Terek Cossacks]].<ref>[[Pavel Polian]] - Forced migrations in USSR - [http://www.memo.ru/history/deport/add1.htm#_VPID_44 Retrieved on 5 February 2007]</ref>
+
+== World War II ==
+When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
+
+In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[POW]] camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.
+
+During the Battle of [[Stalingrad]], Cossacks were able to fully justify their reincarnation in 1936. Attacks, some led by [[Semyon Budenny]], were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains. Not only was the region rich in oil, but it was also the key to [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]].
+
+From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaissance and logistics proved invaluable. Many went on through [[Romania]] and into the [[Balkans]] during the final stages of the war.
+[[Image:KubanCossacks2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Kuban Cossacks, Victory Parade]]
+It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on [[Red Square]] in the famous Victory Parade.
+
+Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied [[Betrayal of the Cossacks|agreements]] thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Surprisingly, following the death of [[Stalin]], large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.
+
+The division of the Cossacks in the Russian Civil War and the Second World War continues to be a controversial issue today.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

-they were gay men who raped each other hanging upside down from trees
+The origins of the first [[Cossacks]] are uncertain. The traditional historiography dates the emergence of Cossacks to the 14-15th centuries. Non-mainstream researchers have ascribed their earlier existence to as early as the tenth century<ref name=Galskow>Vasili Glazkov (Wasili Glaskow), ''History of the Cossacks'', p. 3, Robert Speller & Sons, New York, ISBN 0-8315-0035-2
+*Vasili Glazkov notes that the data [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Iran]]ian and [[Arab]] historians support that. In 1261 Cossacks lived in the area between the rivers [[Dniester]] and the [[Volga]] as described for the first time in Russian chronicles, </ref> specifically mentioning 948 as the year when the inhabitants of the Steppe under the leader named ''Kasak'' or ''Kazak'' routed the [[Khazars]] from the area of modern [[Kuban]] and organized a state called ''Kazakia'' or ''Cossackia''.

+
+In all historical records of that period, Cossack society was described as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of, other nations (such as [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or the Tatars).
+
+In the 16th century, these Cossack societies created two relatively independent territorial organisations:
+* [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporizhia]] (Zaporozhie), on the lower bends of the river Dnieper in Ukraine, between Russia, Poland and the Tatars of the Crimea, with the center, [[Zaporizhian Sich]];
+* The [[Don Cossack State]], on the river Don, separating the then weak Russian State from the [[Mongol]] and Tatar tribes, vassals of Ottoman Empire.

+== Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ==
+
+{{Main|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
+Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks as a sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

+
+Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakov]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.  
+
+In 1539 Grand Prince [[Vasili III of Russia|Basil The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the famous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally. In the 16th-17th century the Zaporoijan Cossacks were subjects of first the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and after the Union of Lublin of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
+
+Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys, that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.  
+
+By 1618 the Zaporozhians were members of the Anti-Turkish League, as Schaidachny transferred his seat of power to [[Kiev]], the Polish Crown's regional capital.  
+
+The fighting qualities of the sea-going Cossacks was even admired in the Ottoman chronicles: ""One can safely say that in the entire world one cannot find a people more careless for their lives or having less fear of death; persons versed in navigation assert that because of their skill and boldness in naval battles these bands are more dangerous than any other enemy."" {{Fact|date=October 2008}}
+
+In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.  An attempt by the Turks to blockade the [[Berezan Island]], and thus deny the Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616, the raiders going on to capture [[Kaffa]], which was burned down after all of the slaves were freed.  That same year [[Trebizond]], in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed.  Sultan [[Ahmed I]] sent his fleet to the Dneiper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Constantinople, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the [[Topkapi Palace]], according to one account.  The city was raided four more times, once in 1620 and no fewer than three times in 1624.

+
+After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years War]]. Their numbers expanded with  immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. [[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles or inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks, eroded the Cossacks' formerly quite strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into [[Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view. After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the [[Zaporozhian Host]] gained control of parts of the Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades. 
+
+There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].
+
+== Ukraine and Russia ==
+After this point, the Cossack nation of the Zaporozhian Host was divided into two semiautonomous republics within the [[Russia|Russian state]]: the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] on the Dnieper's left bank, and the more independent [[Zaporozhia]] to the south. A Cossack organization was also established in the Russian colony of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].
+
+These organizations gradually lost their independence, and were abolished by [[Catherine II]] by the late 18th century. The Hetmanate became the governorship of [[Little Russia]], and Sloboda Ukraine the [[Kharkiv province]]. After having its capital, the [[Zaporozhian Sich|Sich]] as well as [[Baturyn]], destroyed and relocated more than once, Zaporozhia was absorbed into [[New Russia]].
+
+The Cossacks that wanted to continue their lifestyle moved to Ottoman-controlled territies on the Danube or to the Kuban, where they live to this date (see [[Kuban Cossacks]])
+
+== Imperial Russia ==
+''This section derives originally from the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]''
+
+In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], Kuban Cossacks, [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the [[Yenisey Cossack Host]] and Irkutsk Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in 1917. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).
+
+All Cossack males had to perform military service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.
+
+Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18-26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.
+
+In 1893 the Cossacks had a total population of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000&nbsp;acres (593,000&nbsp;km²) of land, including 105,000,000&nbsp;acres (425,000&nbsp;km²) of arable land and 9,400,000&nbsp;acres (38,000&nbsp;km²) under forests. Each ''stanitsa'' controlled a share of the land, divided up at the rate of 81&nbsp;acres (328,000&nbsp;m²) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, ''in lieu'' of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits for gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in 1893), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.
+
+In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos had to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take up arms.

+In the Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Many officers and experienced Cossacks fought for the White Army, and some of the poorer ones joined the Red Army.
+Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of [[Decossackization]] (''Raskazachivaniye'') took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as a potential threat to the new regime. This involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples, but there were also arrests and violent repressions. This policy of resettlement was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest. According to Michael Kort, ""During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 3 million, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Cossacks"".<ref>Kort, Michael (2001).

+== World War II ==
+When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
+
+In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[POW]] camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.
+
+During the Battle of [[Stalingrad]], Cossacks were able to fully justify their reincarnation in 1936. Attacks, some led by [[Semyon Budenny]], were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains. Not only was the region rich in oil, but it was also the key to [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]].
+
+From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaissance and logistics proved invaluable. Many went on through [[Romania]] and into the [[Balkans]] during the final stages of the war.
+[[Image:KubanCossacks2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Kuban Cossacks, Victory Parade]]
+It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on [[Red Square]] in the famous Victory Parade.
+
+Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied [[Betrayal of the Cossacks|agreements]] thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Surprisingly, following the death of [[Stalin]], large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.
+
+The division of the Cossacks in the Russian Civil War and the Second World War continues to be a controversial issue today.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms.

 There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 It is after 1400 that the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of the present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine. Those early Cossacks seemed to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants judging from the records of their names.

Attacks, some led by [[Semyon Budenny]], were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains.

 From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaissance and logistics proved invaluable. Many went on through [[Romania]] and into the [[Balkans]] during the final stages of the war.

 It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on [[Red Square]] in the famous Victory Parade.
 
 Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied [[Betrayal of the Cossacks|agreements]] thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Surprisingly, following the death of [[Stalin]], large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.","Removing ""KubanCossacks2.jpg"", it has been deleted from Commons by [[commons:User:Zscout370|Zscout370]] because: Per [[commons:Commons:Deletion_requests/File:KubanCossacks2.jpg]].",CommonsDelinker,2010-05-22T20:19:27Z,"Removed an image reference (""KubanCossacks2.jpg"") and added contextual information about Cossack collaborators and their roles during the war.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], Kuban Cossacks, [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the [[Yenisey Cossack Host]] and Irkutsk Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in 1917. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).
 
 All Cossack males had to perform military service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.  An attempt by the Turks to blockade the [[Berezan Island]], and thus deny the Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616, the raiders going on to capture [[Kaffa]], which was burned down after all of the slaves were freed.  That same year [[Trebizond]], in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed.  Sultan [[Ahmed I]] sent his fleet to the Dneiper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Constantinople, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the [[Topkapi Palace]], according to one account.  The city was raided four more times, once in 1620 and no fewer than three times in 1624.

 In the Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Many officers and experienced Cossacks fought for the White Army, and some of the poorer ones joined the Red Army.
 Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of [[Decossackization]] (''Raskazachivaniye'') took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as a potential threat to the new regime. This involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples, but there were also arrests and violent repressions. This policy of resettlement was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest. According to Michael Kort, ""During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 3 million, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Cossacks"".<ref>Kort, Michael (2001).

 During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina 1992-1995, cossacks volunteered on Serbian side as a regular battalion. Most important battle is the one in Srebrenica where they helped serbs slaughter more than 8000 people in 2 days.  For their actions they received medals of honor from Radovan Karadzic, currently in Hague, accused for genocide.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 It is after 1400 that the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of the present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine. Those early Cossacks seemed to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants judging from the records of their names.

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks as a sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

-Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakov]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.

 In 1539 Grand Prince [[Vasili III of Russia|Basil The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the infamous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were mostly happy to plunder everybody more or less equally. In the 16th-17th century the Zaporoijan Cossacks were subjects of first the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and after the Union of Lublin of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
 
-Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys, that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.

 The fighting qualities of the sea-going Cossacks were even admired in the Ottoman chronicles: ""One can safely say that in the entire world one cannot find a people more careless for their lives or having less fear of death; persons versed in navigation assert that because of their skill and boldness in naval battles these bands are more dangerous than any other enemy."" {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
 
-In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.  An attempt by the Turks to blockade the [[Berezan Island]], and thus deny the Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616, the raiders going on to capture [[Kaffa]], which was burned down after all of the slaves were freed.

 There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 It is after 1400 that the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts.

The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18.

Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given.

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks as a sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.

 In 1539 Grand Prince [[Vasili III of Russia|Basil The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the infamous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were retardly  happy to plunder everybody more or less equally. In the 16th-17th century the Zaporoijan Cossacks were subjects of first the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and after the Union of Lublin of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration.

 Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys, that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks as a sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

 When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
 
-In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[POW]] camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.

Attacks, some led by [[Semyon Budenny]], were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains.

 It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on [[Red Square]] in the famous Victory Parade.
 
-Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied [[Betrayal of the Cossacks|agreements]] thousands of them were handed back to the USSR.

 Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys, that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms.

 Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of [[Decossackization]] (''Raskazachivaniye'') took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as a potential threat to the new regime. This involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples, but there were also arrests and violent repressions. This policy of resettlement was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest.

 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[prisoner-of-war]] camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.

 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[prisoner-of-war]] camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.

That same year [[Trebizond]], in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed.

 After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years War]].

[[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles for inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks eroded the Cossacks' loyalty towards the Commonwealth.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses.

 Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakiv]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.
 
-In 1539 Grand Prince [[Vasili III of Russia|Basil The Third]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the infamous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were happy to plunder everybody more or less equally. In the 16th-17th century the Zaporoijan Cossacks were subjects of first the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and after the Union of Lublin of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

 Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys, that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.

They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos.

 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[prisoner-of-war]] camps.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests.

-Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks as a sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

 Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakiv]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.
 
-In 1539 Grand Prince [[Vasili III of Russia]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the infamous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between Russia, Ottomans and the Commonwealth, each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for its own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were happy to plunder everybody more or less equally. In the 16th-17th century the Zaporoijan Cossacks were subjects of first the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and after the Union of Lublin of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

-Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys, that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.

 The fighting qualities of the sea-going Cossacks were even admired in the Ottoman chronicles: ""One can safely say that in the entire world one cannot find a people more careless for their lives or having less fear of death; persons versed in navigation assert that because of their skill and boldness in naval battles these bands are more dangerous than any other enemy."" {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

An attempt by the Turks to blockade the [[Berezan Island]], and thus deny the Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616, the raiders going on to capture [[Kaffa (city)|Kaffa]], which was burned down after all of the slaves were freed.  That same year [[Trebizond]], in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed.  Sultan [[Ahmed I]] sent his fleet to the Dneiper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Constantinople, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the [[Topkapı Palace]], according to one account.  The city was raided four more times, once in 1620 and no fewer than three times in 1624.

-After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Their numbers expanded with  immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. [[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles for inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks eroded the Cossacks' loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish–Lithuanian) into [[Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view. After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the [[Zaporozhian Host]] gained control of parts of Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades.

-There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[Deluge (history)|The Deluge]] is considered to be one of the events which brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks as a sovereign nations with a unique warrior culture, for which raids and pillaging conducted against their neighbours were important sources of income. They were renowned for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions increased the tension at the southern border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), which resulted in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

 Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakiv]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.

 In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.

That same year [[Trebizond]], in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed.  Sultan [[Ahmed I]] sent his fleet to the Dneiper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Constantinople, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the [[Topkapı Palace]], according to one account.  The city was raided four more times, once in 1620 and no fewer than three times in 1624.

 After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years War]]. Their numbers expanded with  immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. [[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles for inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks eroded the Cossacks' loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish-Lithuanian) into [[Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view.

After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the [[Zaporozhian Host]] gained control of parts of the Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes.

 ==World War II==
 When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
 
-In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[prisoner-of-war]] camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.

 During the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], Cossacks were able to fully justify their reincarnation in 1936. Attacks, some led by [[Semyon Budyonny]], were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains. Not only was the region rich in oil, but it was also the key to [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]].

 There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[Deluge (history)|The Deluge]] is considered as one of the events that brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

 The origins of the first [[Cossacks]] are uncertain. The [[Ivan Zabelin|Academician Zabelin]] mentioned that peoples of the prairies and of the woods had always needed ""a live frontier"", and even ancient Borisphenites and Tanaites could be the predecessors of Cossacks,<ref>Ivan Zabelin. The history of Russian life. http://az.lib.ru/z/zabelin_i_e/text_0050.shtml</ref> not only [[Khazars]], which assimilated/included [[Severians]], [[Goths]], [[Scythians]] and other ancient inhabitants, as insisted by the Cossack folklore, the Constitution of Pylyp Orlik, and numerous Cossack histors, because of the need of both the Reds and the anti-Bolshevik forces to deny any Cossack ethnicity, the traditional post-imperial [[historiography]] dates the emergence of Cossacks to the 14th-15th centuries. Non-mainstream theories, however, have lent the date 948 from imperial historiography, and ascribed an earlier Cossack existence to the tenth century, but denied Cossack links to both ""the old people"" (Khazars) and ""the new people"" (Russians and Ukrainians; the very terms ""old people"" and ""new people"" being coined by [[Hilarion of Kiev|Metropolitan Ilarion]].) <ref name=Galskow>Vasili Glazkov (Wasili Glaskow), ''History of the Cossacks'', p. 3, Robert Speller & Sons, New York, ISBN 0-8315-0035-2
 *Vasili Glazkov claims that the data [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Iran]]ian and [[Arab]] historians support that. According to this view, by 1261, Cossacks lived in the area between the rivers [[Dniester]] and the [[Volga]] as described for the first time in Russian chronicles.</ref> specifically mentioning 948 as the year when the inhabitants of the Steppe under the leader named ''Kasak'' or ''Kazak'' routed the [[Khazars]] from the area of modern [[Kuban]] and organized a state called ''Kazakia'' or ''[[Cossackia]]''.<ref>Newland, Samuel J.(1991), ''Cossacks in the German army, 1941-1945'', p. 65.

 In all historical records of that period, Cossack society was described as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of, other nations (such as [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or the Tatars){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.
 
 In the 16th century, these Cossack societies created two relatively independent territorial organisations:
-* [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporizhia]] (Zaporozhie), on the lower bends of the river Dnieper in the Ukraine, between Russia, Poland and the Tatars of the Crimea, with the center, [[Zaporizhian Sich]];
-* The [[Don Cossack State]], on the river Don, separated from the Russian State by the rebel [[Nogais|Nogai]] and Tatar tribes.

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks as a sovereign nation with a unique warrior culture, which conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. They were known for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy away from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions exacerbated the tension at the southern border of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), resulting in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.

 Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakiv]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.
 
 In 1539 Grand Prince [[Vasili III of Russia]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the infamous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between Russia, the Ottomans and the Commonwealth; each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for his own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were happy to plunder everybody more or less equally. Between the 16th to the 17th century, the Zaporoijan Cossacks became subjects first of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and later of the Union of Lublin of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

 There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[Deluge (history)|The Deluge]] is considered as one of the events that brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

 After this point, the Cossack nation of the Zaporozhian Host was divided into two semiautonomous republics within the [[Russia|Russian state]]: the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] on the Dnieper's left bank, and the more independent [[Zaporozhia]] to the south. A Cossack organization was also established in the Russian colony of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].
 
 These organizations gradually lost their independence, and were abolished by [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] by the late 18th century. The Hetmanate became the governorship of [[Little Russia]], and Sloboda Ukraine the [[Kharkiv province]]. After having its capital, the [[Zaporozhian Sich|Sich]], similar to Ukrainian capitals [[Chigirin]] and [[Baturyn]] destroyed and relocated more than once, Zaporozhia was absorbed into [[New Russia]].
 
 The Cossacks that wanted to continue their lifestyle moved either to Ottoman and/or Austrian controlled territories on the Danube or after life on Bug and Dniester to the Kuban region, where they live to this date (see [[Kuban Cossacks]])

-In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], Kuban Cossacks, [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the [[Yenisey Cossack Host]] and Irkutsk Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in 1917. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).

 All Cossack males had to perform military service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.
 
 Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18-26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.
 
 In 1893 the Cossacks had a total population of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000&nbsp;acres (593,000&nbsp;km²) of land, including 105,000,000&nbsp;acres (425,000&nbsp;km²) of arable land and 9,400,000&nbsp;acres (38,000&nbsp;km²) under forests. Each ''stanitsa'' controlled a share of the land, divided up at the rate of 81&nbsp;acres (328,000&nbsp;m²) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, ''in lieu'' of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits for gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in 1893), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.

 In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos had to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of World War I the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take up arms.
 
 As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Ussuri Cossacks) sufficed to supply their needs and usually to leave a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in the [[Caucasus]], fishing on the [[Don River, Russia|Don]], the [[Ural River|Ural]], and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, beekeeping etc. The Cossacks mostly rented out rights to extract coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories to strangers, who also owned most factories.
 
 The Tsarist authorities also introduced a military organization similar to that of the Cossacks into certain non-Cossack districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I comprised:
-* [[Republic of Dagestan|Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
-* Kuban [[Circassians]], one sotnia.
-* [[Terek Oblast|Terek]], eight sotnias.

 When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
 
 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. Whilst collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[prisoner-of-war]] camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18.

In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future.

Because of the need of both the Reds and the anti-Bolshevik forces to deny any Cossack ethnicity, the traditional post-imperial [[historiography]] dates the emergence of Cossacks to the 14th-15th centuries. Non-mainstream theories, however, have lent the date 948 from imperial historiography, and ascribed an earlier Cossack existence to the tenth century, but denied Cossack links to both ""the old people"" (Khazars) and ""the new people"" (Russians and Ukrainians; the very terms ""old people"" and ""new people"" being coined by [[Hilarion of Kiev|Metropolitan Ilarion]].) <ref name=Galskow>Vasili Glazkov (Wasili Glaskow), ''History of the Cossacks'', p. 3, Robert Speller & Sons, New York, ISBN 0-8315-0035-2

-However some Turkologists argue that Cossacks are descendants of native [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] (Russian ''половцы'') people of [[Ukraine]], who inhabited the area long before the Mongol invasion and were closely related to modern [[Kazakh people|Kazakhs]]. These people were highly admired for their esquestrian skills by the early Russian military. Many were hired as cavalry by Russian and Ukrainian warlords, in much the same way that they hired [[Chorni Klobuky|Black Klobuks]] as personal guards {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.
-
-It is after 1400 that the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine. Those early Cossacks seemed to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants judging by the records of their names. From the mid-15th century, Cossacks are mostly mentioned with Russian and Ukrainian names.<ref name=Long>Philip Longworth, ''The Cossacks'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970, ISBN 0-03-081855-9</ref>
-
-In all historical records of that period, Cossack society was described as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of, other nations (such as [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or the Tatars){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.
-
-In the 16th century, these Cossack societies created two relatively independent territorial organisations:
-*[[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporizhia]] (Zaporozhie), on the lower bends of the river Dnieper in the Ukraine, between Russia, Poland and the Tatars of the Crimea, with the center, [[Zaporizhian Sich]];
-*The [[Don Cossack State]], on the river Don, separated from the Russian State by the rebel [[Nogais|Nogai]] and Tatar tribes.
-
-==Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth==
-{{Main|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
-Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks as a sovereign nation with a unique warrior culture, which conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. They were known for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy away from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions exacerbated the tension at the southern border of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), resulting in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.
-[[File:Powrot Kozakow.jpg|thumb|left|300px|""The Return of the Cossacks"", oil on canvas, 1894, 61 x 120&nbsp;cm, painted by [[Józef Brandt]].]]
-Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakiv]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.
-
-In 1539 Grand Prince [[Vasili III of Russia]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the infamous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between Russia, the Ottomans and the Commonwealth; each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for his own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were happy to plunder everybody more or less equally. Between the 16th to the 17th century, the Zaporoijan Cossacks became subjects first of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and later of the Union of Lublin of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
-
-Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.
-
-By 1618 the Zaporozhians were members of the Anti-Turkish League, as Schaidachny transferred his seat of power to [[Kiev]], the Polish Crown's regional capital.
-
-The fighting qualities of the sea-going Cossacks were even admired in the Ottoman chronicles: ""One can safely say that in the entire world one cannot find a people more careless for their lives or having less fear of death; persons versed in navigation assert that because of their skill and boldness in naval battles these bands are more dangerous than any other enemy."" {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
-
-In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.  An attempt by the Turks to blockade the [[Berezan Island]], and deny Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616. The raiders went on to capture [[Kaffa (city)|Kaffa]], which was burned down after all the slaves were freed.  That same year [[Trabzon|Trebizond]], in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed.  Sultan [[Ahmed I]] sent his fleet to the Dneiper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Constantinople, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the [[Topkapı Palace]], according to one account.  The city was raided four more times, once in 1620 and no fewer than three times in 1624.

-
-After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Their numbers expanded with  immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. [[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles for inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks eroded the Cossacks' loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish–Lithuanian) into [[Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view. After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the [[Zaporozhian Host]] gained control of parts of Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades.
-
-There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[Deluge (history)|The Deluge]] is considered as one of the events that brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].
-
-==Ukraine and Russia==
-After this point, the Cossack nation of the Zaporozhian Host was divided into two semiautonomous republics within the [[Russia|Russian state]]: the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] on the Dnieper's left bank, and the more independent [[Zaporozhia]] to the south. A Cossack organization was also established in the Russian colony of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].
-
-These organizations gradually lost their independence, and were abolished by [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] by the late 18th century. The Hetmanate became the governorship of [[Little Russia]], and Sloboda Ukraine the [[Kharkiv province]]. After having its capital, the [[Zaporozhian Sich|Sich]], similar to Ukrainian capitals [[Chigirin]] and [[Baturyn]] destroyed and relocated more than once, Zaporozhia was absorbed into [[New Russia]].
-
-The Cossacks that wanted to continue their lifestyle moved either to Ottoman and/or Austrian controlled territories on the Danube or after life on Bug and Dniester to the Kuban region, where they live to this date (see [[Kuban Cossacks]])

-In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], Kuban Cossacks, [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the Yenisey Cossack Host and Irkutsk Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in 1917. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).
-
-All Cossack males had to perform military service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.
-
-Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18-26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.
-
-In 1893 the Cossacks had a total population of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000&nbsp;acres (593,000&nbsp;km²) of land, including 105,000,000&nbsp;acres (425,000&nbsp;km²) of arable land and 9,400,000&nbsp;acres (38,000&nbsp;km²) under forests. Each ''stanitsa'' controlled a share of the land, divided up at the rate of 81&nbsp;acres (328,000&nbsp;m²) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, ''in lieu'' of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits for gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in 1893), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.
-[[File:Russian cavalry.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Russian cossacks on the front. 1915]]
-In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos had to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of World War I the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take up arms.
-
-As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Ussuri Cossacks) sufficed to supply their needs and usually to leave a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in the [[Caucasus]], fishing on the [[Don River, Russia|Don]], the [[Ural River|Ural]], and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, beekeeping etc. The Cossacks mostly rented out rights to extract coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories to strangers, who also owned most factories.
-
-The Tsarist authorities also introduced a military organization similar to that of the Cossacks into certain non-Cossack districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I comprised:
-*[[Republic of Dagestan|Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
-*Kuban [[Circassians]], one sotnia.
-*[[Terek Oblast|Terek]], eight sotnias.
-*[[Kars]], three sotnias.
-*[[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
-*[[Turkmen people|Turkomans]], three sotnias.
-
-In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

-==Russian Revolution==
-{{Further|Red Cossacks}}
-{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
-In the Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Many officers and experienced Cossacks fought for the White Army, and some of the poorer ones joined the Red Army. Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of [[Decossackization]] (''Raskazachivaniye'') took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as a potential threat to the new regime. This involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples, but there were also arrests and violent repressions. This policy of resettlement was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest. According to Michael Kort, ""During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 3 million, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Cossacks"".<ref>Kort, Michael (2001). ''The Soviet Colosus: History and Aftermath'', p. 133. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe. ISBN 0-7656-0396-9.</ref> Including 45 thousand [[Terek Cossacks]].<ref>[[Pavel Polian]] - Forced migrations in USSR - [http://www.memo.ru/history/deport/add1.htm#_VPID_44 Retrieved on 5 February 2007]</ref>
-
-==World War II==
-When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
-
-In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. While collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[prisoner-of-war]] camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.
-
-During the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], Cossacks were able to fully justify their reincarnation in 1936. Attacks, some led by [[Semyon Budyonny]], were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains. Not only was the region rich in oil, but it was also the key to [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]].
-
-From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaissance and logistics proved invaluable. Many went on through [[Romania]] and into the [[Balkans]] during the final stages of the war.
-
-It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on [[Red Square]] in the famous Victory Parade.
-
-Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied [[Betrayal of the Cossacks|agreements]] thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.
-
-The division of the Cossacks in the Russian Civil War and the Second World War continues to be a controversial issue today.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

+The '''history of the Cossacks''' spans several centuries.
+
+==Early history==
+The origins of the first [[Cossacks]] are uncertain. The [[Ivan Zabelin|Academician Zabelin]] mentioned that peoples of the prairies and of the woods had always needed ""a live frontier"", and even ancient Borisphenites and Tanaites could be the predecessors of Cossacks,<ref>Ivan Zabelin. The history of Russian life. http://az.lib.ru/z/zabelin_i_e/text_0050.shtml</ref> not only [[Khazars]], which assimilated/included [[Severians]], [[Goths]], [[Scythians]] and other ancient inhabitants, as insisted by the Cossack folklore, the Constitution of Pylyp Orlik, and numerous Cossack historians. Because of the need of both the Reds and the anti-Bolshevik forces to deny any Cossack ethnicity, the traditional post-imperial [[historiography]] dates the emergence of Cossacks to the 14th-15th centuries. Non-mainstream theories, however, have lent the date 948 from imperial historiography, and ascribed an earlier Cossack existence to the tenth century, but denied Cossack links to both ""the old people"" (Khazars) and ""the new people"" (Russians and Ukrainians; the very terms ""old people"" and ""new people"" being coined by [[Hilarion of Kiev|Metropolitan Ilarion]].) <ref name=Galskow>Vasili Glazkov (Wasili Glaskow), ''History of the Cossacks'', p. 3, Robert Speller & Sons, New York, ISBN 0-8315-0035-2
+*Vasili Glazkov claims that the data [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Iran]]ian and [[Arab]] historians support that. According to this view, by 1261, Cossacks lived in the area between the rivers [[Dniester]] and the [[Volga]] as described for the first time in Russian chronicles.</ref> specifically mentioning 948 as the year when the inhabitants of the Steppe under the leader named ''Kasak'' or ''Kazak'' routed the [[Khazars]] from the area of modern [[Kuban]] and organized a state called ''Kazakia'' or ''[[Cossackia]]''.<ref>Newland, Samuel J.(1991), ''Cossacks in the German army, 1941-1945'', p. 65. [[Routledge]], ISBN 0-7146-3351-8</ref>
+
+Some historians suggest that the Cossack people were of mixed ethnic origins, descending from [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Tatars]], [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]] and others who settled or passed through the vast Steppe that stretches from Asia to southern Europe.<ref name=Newland>Samuel J Newland, ''Cossacks in the German Army, 1941-1945'', Routledge, 1991, ISBN 0-7146-3351-8</ref>
+
+However some Turkologists argue that Cossacks are descendants of native [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] (Russian ''половцы'') people of [[Ukraine]], who inhabited the area long before the Mongol invasion and were closely related to modern [[Kazakh people|Kazakhs]]. These people were highly admired for their esquestrian skills by the early Russian military. Many were hired as cavalry by Russian and Ukrainian warlords, in much the same way that they hired [[Chorni Klobuky|Black Klobuks]] as personal guards {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.
+
+It is after 1400 that the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine. Those early Cossacks seemed to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants judging by the records of their names. From the mid-15th century, Cossacks are mostly mentioned with Russian and Ukrainian names.<ref name=Long>Philip Longworth, ''The Cossacks'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970, ISBN 0-03-081855-9</ref>
+
+In all historical records of that period, Cossack society was described as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of, other nations (such as [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or the Tatars){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.
+
+In the 16th century, these Cossack societies created two relatively independent territorial organisations:
+*[[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporizhia]] (Zaporozhie), on the lower bends of the river Dnieper in the Ukraine, between Russia, Poland and the Tatars of the Crimea, with the center, [[Zaporizhian Sich]];
+*The [[Don Cossack State]], on the river Don, separated from the Russian State by the rebel [[Nogais|Nogai]] and Tatar tribes.
+
+==Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth==
+{{Main|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
+Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks as a sovereign nation with a unique warrior culture, which conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. They were known for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy away from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions exacerbated the tension at the southern border of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), resulting in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.
+[[File:Powrot Kozakow.jpg|thumb|left|300px|""The Return of the Cossacks"", oil on canvas, 1894, 61 x 120&nbsp;cm, painted by [[Józef Brandt]].]]
+Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakiv]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.  Their success was such that they attracted the attention of the western European powers, including the Papacy, who made diplomatic overtures in the hope of launching joint ventures against the Turks.
+
+In 1539 Grand Prince [[Vasili III of Russia]] asked the Ottoman Sultan to curb the Cossacks and the Sultan replied: ""The Cossacks do not swear allegiance to me, and they live as they themselves please."" In 1549 the infamous Tsar of Russia, [[Ivan the Terrible]], replied to a request of the Turkish Sultan to stop the aggressive actions of the Don Cossacks, stating, ""The Cossacks of the Don are not my subjects, and they go to war or live in peace without my knowledge."" Similar exchanges passed between Russia, the Ottomans and the Commonwealth; each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for his own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were happy to plunder everybody more or less equally. Between the 16th to the 17th century, the Zaporoijan Cossacks became subjects first of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and later of the Union of Lublin of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
+
+Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.
+
+By 1618 the Zaporozhians were members of the Anti-Turkish League, as Schaidachny transferred his seat of power to [[Kiev]], the Polish Crown's regional capital.
+
+The fighting qualities of the sea-going Cossacks were even admired in the Ottoman chronicles: ""One can safely say that in the entire world one cannot find a people more careless for their lives or having less fear of death; persons versed in navigation assert that because of their skill and boldness in naval battles these bands are more dangerous than any other enemy."" {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
+
+In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.  An attempt by the Turks to blockade the [[Berezan Island]], and deny Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616. The raiders went on to capture [[Kaffa (city)|Kaffa]], which was burned down after all the slaves were freed.  That same year [[Trabzon|Trebizond]], in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed.  Sultan [[Ahmed I]] sent his fleet to the Dneiper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Constantinople, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the [[Topkapı Palace]], according to one account.  The city was raided four more times, once in 1620 and no fewer than three times in 1624.

+
+After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Their numbers expanded with  immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. [[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles for inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks eroded the Cossacks' loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish–Lithuanian) into [[Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view. After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the [[Zaporozhian Host]] gained control of parts of Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades.
+
+There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[Deluge (history)|The Deluge]] is considered as one of the events that brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].
+
+==Ukraine and Russia==
+After this point, the Cossack nation of the Zaporozhian Host was divided into two semiautonomous republics within the [[Russia|Russian state]]: the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] on the Dnieper's left bank, and the more independent [[Zaporozhia]] to the south. A Cossack organization was also established in the Russian colony of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].
+
+These organizations gradually lost their independence, and were abolished by [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] by the late 18th century. The Hetmanate became the governorship of [[Little Russia]], and Sloboda Ukraine the [[Kharkiv province]]. After having its capital, the [[Zaporozhian Sich|Sich]], similar to Ukrainian capitals [[Chigirin]] and [[Baturyn]] destroyed and relocated more than once, Zaporozhia was absorbed into [[New Russia]].
+
+The Cossacks that wanted to continue their lifestyle moved either to Ottoman and/or Austrian controlled territories on the Danube or after life on Bug and Dniester to the Kuban region, where they live to this date (see [[Kuban Cossacks]])

+In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], Kuban Cossacks, [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the Yenisey Cossack Host and Irkutsk Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in 1917. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).
+
+All Cossack males had to perform military service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.
+
+Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18-26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.
+
+In 1893 the Cossacks had a total population of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000&nbsp;acres (593,000&nbsp;km²) of land, including 105,000,000&nbsp;acres (425,000&nbsp;km²) of arable land and 9,400,000&nbsp;acres (38,000&nbsp;km²) under forests. Each ''stanitsa'' controlled a share of the land, divided up at the rate of 81&nbsp;acres (328,000&nbsp;m²) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, ''in lieu'' of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits for gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in 1893), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration. Each voisko had a separate general administration, and administrative structures differed within the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, comprising representatives of each voisko, discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.
+[[File:Russian cavalry.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Russian cossacks on the front. 1915]]
+In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos had to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of World War I the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take up arms.
+
+As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Ussuri Cossacks) sufficed to supply their needs and usually to leave a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in the [[Caucasus]], fishing on the [[Don River, Russia|Don]], the [[Ural River|Ural]], and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, beekeeping etc. The Cossacks mostly rented out rights to extract coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories to strangers, who also owned most factories.
+
+The Tsarist authorities also introduced a military organization similar to that of the Cossacks into certain non-Cossack districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I comprised:
+*[[Republic of Dagestan|Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
+*Kuban [[Circassians]], one sotnia.
+*[[Terek Oblast|Terek]], eight sotnias.
+*[[Kars]], three sotnias.
+*[[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
+*[[Turkmen people|Turkomans]], three sotnias.
+
+In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

+==Russian Revolution==
+{{Further|Red Cossacks}}
+{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
+In the Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Many officers and experienced Cossacks fought for the White Army, and some of the poorer ones joined the Red Army. Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of [[Decossackization]] (''Raskazachivaniye'') took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as a potential threat to the new regime. This involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples, but there were also arrests and violent repressions. This policy of resettlement was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest. According to Michael Kort, ""During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 3 million, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Cossacks"".<ref>Kort, Michael (2001). ''The Soviet Colosus: History and Aftermath'', p. 133. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe. ISBN 0-7656-0396-9.</ref> Including 45 thousand [[Terek Cossacks]].<ref>[[Pavel Polian]] - Forced migrations in USSR - [http://www.memo.ru/history/deport/add1.htm#_VPID_44 Retrieved on 5 February 2007]</ref>
+
+==World War II==
+When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
+
+In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. While collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[prisoner-of-war]] camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.
+
+During the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], Cossacks were able to fully justify their reincarnation in 1936. Attacks, some led by [[Semyon Budyonny]], were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains. Not only was the region rich in oil, but it was also the key to [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]].
+
+From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaissance and logistics proved invaluable. Many went on through [[Romania]] and into the [[Balkans]] during the final stages of the war.
+
+It should be pointed out that most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that) were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on [[Red Square]] in the famous Victory Parade.
+
+Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied [[Betrayal of the Cossacks|agreements]] thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.
+
+The division of the Cossacks in the Russian Civil War and the Second World War continues to be a controversial issue today.

The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows:

 It is after 1400 that the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine. Those early Cossacks seemed to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants judging by the records of their names. From the mid-15th century, Cossacks are mostly mentioned with Russian and Ukrainian names.<ref name=Long>Philip Longworth, ''The Cossacks'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970, {{ISBN|0-03-081855-9}}</ref>

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 It is after 1400 that the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine.

The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.

* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.

 It is after 1400 that the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine. Those early Cossacks seemed to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants judging by the records of their names. From the mid-15th century, Cossacks are mostly mentioned with Russian and Ukrainian names.<ref name=Long>Philip Longworth, ''The Cossacks'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970, {{ISBN|0-03-081855-9}}</ref>

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses).

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 It is after 1400 that the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine. Those early Cossacks seemed to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants judging by the records of their names. From the mid-15th century, Cossacks are mostly mentioned with Slavic names.<ref name=Long>Philip Longworth, ''The Cossacks'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970, {{ISBN|0-03-081855-9}}</ref>
 
 In all historical records of that period, Cossack society was described as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of other nations (such as [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]],

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve.

The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests.

The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes.

The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses.

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

+Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks in Russia as a sovereign ethno-cultural people with a unique warrior culture. Cossacks conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. Already in 1444 Cossacks of [[Ryazan]] were mentioned as defenders of [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]] against the units of [[Golden Horde]] and in a letter of [[Ivan III of Russia]] in 1502. The area around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] was divided between the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean west side]] and the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai east side]] after the Golden Horde fell in 1480. The vast steppe of the Don region was populated by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom. by people which were not satisfied with the existing social order.

 Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50- to 70-man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.

 These organizations gradually lost their independence, and were abolished by [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] by the late 18th century. The Hetmanate became the governorship of [[Little Russia]], and Sloboda Ukraine the [[Kharkiv province]]. After having its capital, the [[Zaporozhian Sich|Sich]], similar to Ukrainian capitals [[Chigirin]] and [[Baturyn]] destroyed and relocated more than once, Zaporozhia was absorbed into [[New Russia]].

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks in Russia as a sovereign ethno-cultural people with a unique warrior culture. Cossacks conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. Already in 1444 Cossacks of [[Ryazan]] were mentioned as defenders of [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]] against the units of [[Golden Horde]] and in a letter of [[Ivan III of Russia]] in 1502. The area around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] was divided between the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean west side]] and the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai east side]] after the Golden Horde fell in 1480. The vast steppe of the Don region was populated by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom. by people which were not satisfied with the existing social order. Over time, the culture of Don Cossacks was formed into a united community and were called ""the Cossacks"". 
 
 The Don cossacks known for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy away from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions exacerbated the tension at the southern border of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), resulting in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/775318938|title=Performing Russia : folk revival and Russian identity|last=Olson, Laura J.|first=|date=2006|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|year=|isbn=9780415326148|location=|pages=163|oclc=775318938|url-status=live}}</ref>",/* Russian Don Cossacks */ Change header: implies that they were 'Russian'.

In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses.

 It is after 1400 that the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine. Those early Cossacks seemed to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants judging by the records of their names.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.

* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks in Russia as a sovereign ethno-cultural people with a unique warrior culture. Cossacks conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. Already in 1444 Cossacks of [[Ryazan]] were mentioned as defenders of [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]] against the units of [[Golden Horde]] and in a letter of [[Ivan III of Russia]] in 1502. The area around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] was divided between the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean west side]] and the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai east side]] after the Golden Horde fell in 1480. The vast steppe of the Don region was populated by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom. by people which were not satisfied with the existing social order. Over time, the culture of Don Cossacks was formed into a united community and were called ""the Cossacks"".

 Their first recorded naval raid into the [[Black Sea]] dates to 1538, with an attack on the fortress of [[Ochakiv]].  This was followed by more frequent and better-organised raids elsewhere, the freeing of Christian slaves being one of the chief aims, as well as the acquisition of plunder.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50- to 70-man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.

 By 1618 the Zaporozhians were members of the Anti-Turkish League, as Schaidachny transferred his seat of power to [[Kiev]], the Polish Crown's regional capital.
 
 The fighting qualities of the sea-going Cossacks were even admired in the Ottoman chronicles: ""One can safely say that in the entire world one cannot find a people more careless for their lives or having less fear of death; persons versed in navigation assert that because of their skill and boldness in naval battles these bands are more dangerous than any other enemy."" {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
 
 In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.  An attempt by the Turks to blockade the [[Berezan Island]], and deny Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616. The raiders went on to capture [[Kaffa (city)|Kaffa]], which was burned down after all the slaves were freed.  That same year [[Trabzon|Trebizond]], in eastern Anatolia, was captured and destroyed.  Sultan [[Ahmed I]] sent his fleet to the Dneiper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Constantinople, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the [[Topkapı Palace]], according to one account.  The city was raided four more times, once in 1620 and no fewer than three times in 1624.

 After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Their numbers expanded with immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. [[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles for inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks eroded the Cossacks' loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish–Lithuanian) into [[Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view. After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the [[Zaporozhian Host]] gained control of parts of Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks.

 Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50- to 70-man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.

They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future.

 Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied [[Betrayal of the Cossacks|agreements]] thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 ==Don Cossacks==
-Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks in Russia as a sovereign ethno-cultural people with a unique warrior culture. Cossacks conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms.

 There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[Deluge (history)|The Deluge]] is considered as one of the events that brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.

 ==Don Cossacks==
 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks in Russia as a sovereign ethno-cultural people with a unique warrior culture. Cossacks conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. Already in 1444 Cossacks of [[Ryazan]] were mentioned as defenders of [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]] against the units of [[Golden Horde]] and in a letter of [[Ivan III of Russia]] in 1502. The area around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] was divided between the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean west side]] and the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai east side]] after the Golden Horde fell in 1480. The vast steppe of the Don region was populated by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom. by people which were not satisfied with the existing social order. Over time, the culture of Don Cossacks was formed into a united community and were called ""the Cossacks"".

The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses.

In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).

 ==Don Cossacks==
 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks in Russia as a sovereign ethno-cultural people with a unique warrior culture. Cossacks conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. Already in 1444 Cossacks of [[Ryazan]] were mentioned as defenders of [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]] against the units of [[Golden Horde]] and in a letter of [[Ivan III of Russia]] in 1502. The area around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] was divided between the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean west side]] and the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai east side]] after the Golden Horde fell in 1480. The vast steppe of the Don region was populated by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom, by people who were not satisfied with the existing social order. Over time, the culture of the Don Cossacks was formed into a united community and were called ""the Cossacks"".

The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks in Russia as a sovereign ethno-cultural people with a unique warrior culture. Cossacks conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. Already in 1444 Cossacks of [[Ryazan]] were mentioned as defenders of [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]] against the units of [[Golden Horde]] and in a letter of [[Ivan III of Russia]] in 1502. The area around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] was divided between the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean west side]] and the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai east side]] after the Golden Horde fell in 1480. The vast steppe of the Don region was populated by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom, by people who were not satisfied with the existing social order. Over time, the culture of the Don Cossacks was formed into a united community and were called ""the Cossacks"".
 
 The Don cossacks known for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy away from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions exacerbated the tension at the southern border of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ([[Kresy]]), resulting in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Performing Russia : folk revival and Russian identity|last=Olson, Laura J.|date=2006|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|isbn=9780415326148|pages=163|oclc=775318938}}</ref>

 Similar exchanges passed between Russia, the Ottomans and the Commonwealth; each of which often tried to use the Cossacks' warmongering for his own purposes. The Cossacks for their part were happy to plunder everybody more or less equally. Between the 16th to the 17th century, the Zaporoijan Cossacks became subjects first of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and later of the Union of Lublin of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
 
-Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea.  According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50- to 70-man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours.  The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys that served as command and control centres.  The raids also acquired a distinct political purpose after [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] became ''hetman'' in 1613, intending to turn the host into the nucleus of a Ukrainian nation with the support of the European states.

 By 1618 the Zaporozhians were members of the Anti-Turkish League, as Schaidachny transferred his seat of power to [[Kiev]], the Polish Crown's regional capital.
 
 The fighting qualities of the sea-going Cossacks were even admired in the Ottoman chronicles: ""One can safely say that in the entire world one cannot find a people more careless for their lives or having less fear of death; persons versed in navigation assert that because of their skill and boldness in naval battles these bands are more dangerous than any other enemy."" {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
 
-In 1615 the raiders even sailed to the walls of [[Tsargrad|Tsarhorod]], as they referred to the Turkish capital, plundering the ports of Mizevna and Archioca.  An attempt by the Turks to blockade the [[Berezan Island]], and deny Cossacks access to the sea, was defeated in the spring of 1616.

Sultan [[Ahmed I]] sent his fleet to the Dneiper in pursuit; but instead of going home the Cossacks once more sailed to Constantinople, where they raided at leisure, even rampaging through the [[Topkapı Palace]], according to one account.

 After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Their numbers expanded with immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. [[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles for inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks eroded the Cossacks' loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish–Lithuanian) into [[Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view. After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the [[Zaporozhian Host]] gained control of parts of Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades.

-In the Civil War that followed the Russian Revolution, the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Many officers and experienced Cossacks fought for the White Army, and some of the poorer ones joined the Red Army. Following the defeat of the White Army, a policy of [[Decossackization]] (''Raskazachivaniye'') took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands since they were viewed as a potential threat to the new regime. This involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples, but there were also arrests and violent repressions. This policy of resettlement was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest.

This involved dividing their territory amongst other divisions and giving it to new autonomous republics of minorities, and then actively encouraging settlement of these territories with those peoples, but there were also arrests and violent repressions. This policy of resettlement was especially true for the Terek Cossacks land. The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of [[kulak]]s. The famine of 1933 hit the Don and Kuban territory the hardest. According to Michael Kort, ""During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 3 million, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Cossacks"",<ref>Kort, Michael (2001). ''The Soviet Colosus: History and Aftermath'', p. 133. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe. {{ISBN|0-7656-0396-9}}.</ref> including 45,000[[Terek Cossacks]].<ref>[[Pavel Polian]] - Forced migrations in USSR - [http://www.memo.ru/history/deport/add1.htm#_VPID_44 Retrieved on 5 February 2007]</ref>
 
 ==World War II==
 When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
 
 In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. While collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[prisoner-of-war]] camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.
 
-During the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], Cossacks were able to fully justify their reincarnation in 1936. Attacks, some led by [[Semyon Budyonny]], were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains. Not only was the region rich in oil, but it was also the key to [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]].

 From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaissance and logistics proved invaluable. Many went on through [[Romania]] and into the [[Balkans]] during the final stages of the war.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks in Russia as a sovereign ethno-cultural people with a unique warrior culture. Cossacks conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. Already in 1444 Cossacks of [[Ryazan]] were mentioned as defenders of [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]] against the units of [[Golden Horde]] and in a letter of [[Ivan III of Russia]] in 1502. The area around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] was divided between the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean west side]] and the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai east side]] after the Golden Horde fell in 1480. The vast steppe of the Don region was populated by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom, by people who were not satisfied with the existing social order. Over time, the culture of the Don Cossacks was formed into a united community and were called ""the Cossacks"".

 ==Don Cossacks==
 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks in Russia as a sovereign ethno-cultural people with a unique warrior culture. Cossacks conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. Already in 1444 Cossacks of [[Ryazan]] were mentioned as defenders of [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]] against the units of [[Golden Horde]] and in a letter of [[Ivan III of Russia]] in 1502. The area around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] was divided between the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean west side]] and the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai east side]] after the Golden Horde fell in 1480. The vast steppe of the Don region was populated by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom, by people who were not satisfied with the existing social order. Over time, the culture of the Don Cossacks was formed into a united community and were called ""the Cossacks"".",/* Early history */,180.235.105.198,2021-04-19T06:24:45Z,"The change made in this revision is the **rephrasing of several sentences** for clarity and grammatical accuracy, as well as the addition of some qualifiers (e.g., ""by whom?"" and ""when?"").

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.

-In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted 11 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], Kuban Cossacks, [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]]. Also, there was a small number of the Cossacks in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Irkutsk]], who would form the Yenisey Cossack Host and Irkutsk Cossack [[regiment]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in 1917. The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 After 1400 the Cossacks emerge as an established and identifiable group in historical accounts. Rulers of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] employed Cossacks as mobile guards against Tatar raids from the south in the territories of present-day southwestern Russia and southern Ukraine. Judging by the records of their names, these early Cossacks seem to have included a significant number of Tatar descendants. From the mid-15th century, Cossacks are mostly mentioned with Slavic names.<ref name=Long>

-All historical records of that period describe Cossack society as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of other nations (such as [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]] or the Tatars).{{Citation needed|date= May 2009}}

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses.

 ==Don Cossacks==
 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks in Russia as a sovereign ethno-cultural people with a unique warrior culture. Cossacks conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. Already in 1444 Cossacks of [[Ryazan]] were mentioned as defenders of [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]] against the units of [[Golden Horde]] and in a letter of [[Ivan III of Russia]] in 1502. The area around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] was divided between the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean west side]] and the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai east side]] after the Golden Horde fell in 1480. The vast steppe of the Don region was populated by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom, by people who were not satisfied with the existing social order. Over time, the culture of the Don Cossacks was formed into a united community and were called ""the Cossacks"".

 Using small, shallow-draft, and highly manoeuvrable galleys known as ''[[chaiky]]'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea. According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50- to 70-man crew, could reach the Anatolian coast of Asia Minor from the mouth of the Dnieper River in forty hours. The ''chaiky'' were often accompanied by larger galleys that served as command and control centres.

 There were several Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth in the early 17th century. The largest of them was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which together with [[Deluge (history)|The Deluge]] is considered as one of the events that brought an end to the Golden Age of the Commonwealth. This uprising distanced Cossacks from the Commonwealth sphere of influence, only to make them subject to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654), and established their realm as [[Left-bank Ukraine]] in 1667 under the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], and the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks in Russia as a sovereign ethno-cultural people with a unique warrior culture. Cossacks conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. Already in 1444 Cossacks of [[Ryazan]] were mentioned as defenders of [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]] against the units of [[Golden Horde]] and in a letter of [[Ivan III of Russia]] in 1502. The area around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] was divided between the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean west side]] and the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai east side]] after the Golden Horde fell in 1480. The vast steppe of the Don region was populated by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom, by people who were not satisfied with the existing social order. Over time, the culture of the Don Cossacks was formed into a united community and were called ""the Cossacks"".
 
 The Don cossacks known for their attacks on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its [[vassal]]s (like the Tatars), although they did not shy away from pillaging other neighbouring communities. Their actions exacerbated the tension at the southern border of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] ([[Kresy]]), resulting in almost constant low-level warfare in those territories for almost the entire existence of the Commonwealth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Performing Russia : folk revival and Russian identity|last=Olson, Laura J.|date=2006|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|isbn=9780415326148|pages=163|oclc=775318938}}</ref>

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 After 1624 the Zaporozhian raids gradually died out, as the Cossacks began to devote more and more of their martial energies to land-based campaigns, fighting on one side and then the other during such conflicts as the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Their numbers expanded with immigration from Poland proper and Lithuania. [[Szlachta]] failure to regard Zaporozhian Cossacks as nobles for inclusion in the registry of professional military cossacks eroded the Cossacks' loyalty towards the Commonwealth. The Cossack attempts to be recognized as equal to the szlachta were rebuffed and plans for transforming the Two-Nations Commonwealth (Polish–Lithuanian) into [[Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth|Three Nations]] (with Cossacks/Ruthenian people) were limited to a minority view. After the civil war of 1648 (or Rebellion from the Polish viewpoint) the [[Zaporozhian Host]] gained control of parts of Ukraine in 1649, although they at various time acknowledged the Polish King over the following decades.

The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

-In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted 12 separate [[Cossack voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: the [[Don Cossacks]], [[Kuban Cossacks]], [[Terek Cossacks]], [[Buh Cossacks]], [[Astrakhan Cossacks]], [[Ural Cossacks]], [[Orenburg Cossacks]], [[Siberian Cossacks]], [[Semiryechensk Cossacks]], [[Baikal Cossacks]], [[Amur Cossacks]], and [[Ussuri Cossacks]].

The ''stanitsa'', or village formed the primary unit of this organization. Each ''stanitsa'' held its land as a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], and might allow non-Cossacks (excepting [[Jew]]s) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly. This assembly resembled the ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', but had wider attributes: it assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its [[ataman]] (leader) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides).

 All Cossack males had to perform military service for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. They spent their first three years in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack had to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms.
 
 Cossacks on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approximately age 18–26) normally performed active service, while the rest effectively functioned as reserves, based at home but bound to march out at short notice. The officers came from the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.
 
-In 1893 the Cossacks had a total population of 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000&nbsp;acres (593,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land, including 105,000,000&nbsp;acres (425,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of arable land and 9,400,000&nbsp;acres (38,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) under forests. Each ''stanitsa'' controlled a share of the land, divided up at the rate of 81&nbsp;acres (328,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, ''in lieu'' of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands (which they rented to different persons), also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits for gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in 1893), went to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. Village taxes covered the expenditure of the village administration.

 ==World War II==
 When the war broke out the Cossacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict. Most fought for the Soviet Union; however, some chose to settle old scores by collaborating with the Germans, especially after the Soviet Union's initial series of defeats, including the loss of much of the army of Ivan Kononov, a former Soviet major who defected to the Germans on the first day of war with some of his 436th regiment, and served around the German-occupied city of [[Mahilyow|Mogilev]], guarding lines of communications against [[Soviet partisans]].
 
-In the summer of 1942 the German armies entered territories inhabited by the Cossacks. There in the open steppe resistance was futile, but nevertheless many, despite their hatred of Communism, refused to collaborate with the invaders of their country. While collaboration was inevitable, most of the leaders were former Tsarist officers who wanted to avenge their defeat by the Communists, but many recruits came from [[prisoner-of-war]] camps. On some occasions relatives separated by the Russian Civil War met each other again on different sides of the conflict and killed ruthlessly.

 During the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], Cossacks attacks, some led by [[Semyon Budyonny]], were able to keep the Germans from entering the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains. Not only was the region rich in oil, but it was also the key to [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]].
 
-From 1943 the Cossacks were kept mostly in the southern part of the front, where their use in reconnaissance and logistics proved invaluable. Many went on through [[Romania]] and into the [[Balkans]] during the final stages of the war.

 Most of the collaborators, who some say numbered over 250,000 (although current figures claim the true number was not even a third of that){{citation needed|date=January 2020}} were the Don Cossacks, who, formerly the largest and strongest host, suffered the worst under Soviet collectivization policies. Kuban and Terek Cossacks, on the other hand, fought almost exclusively for the Red Army, and even in most desperate situations their heroism was evident. Being the largest Red Army Cossack host, the Kuban Cossacks in 1945 triumphantly marched on [[Red Square]] in the famous Victory Parade.
 
 Many of the collaborators fled the Soviet advance (often chased by Soviet Cossacks) but under Soviet-Allied [[Betrayal of the Cossacks|agreements]] thousands of them were handed back to the USSR. Following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], large numbers of the repatriated were allowed to return to their native lands, under a promise of secrecy. Only after 1991, with the collapse of the Communist regime in the USSR, could they openly mourn the lost members of their communities.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 All historical records of that period describe Cossack society as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of other nations (such as [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], or the [[Tatars]]).<ref>{{Cite web |title=哥萨克人_360百科 |url=https://upimg.baike.so.com/doc/6607014-6820801.html |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=upimg.baike.so.com}}</ref>

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.
* [[Turkoman]]s, three sotnias.
* In total, 25 squadrons and 2 companies.

 All historical records of that period describe Cossack society as a loose [[federation]] of independent communities, often merging into larger units of a military character, entirely separate from, and mostly independent of other nations (such as [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], or the [[Tatars]]).<ref>{{Cite web |title=哥萨克人_360百科 |url=https://upimg.baike.so.com/doc/6607014-6820801.html |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=upimg.baike.so.com}}</ref>

The study data also show the almost complete absence [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] admixture in both male and female lines.

 ==Don Cossacks==
 Numerous historical documents of that period refer to the Don Cossacks in Russia as a sovereign ethno-cultural people with a unique warrior culture. Cossacks conducted raids and pillaging against their neighbours as important sources of income. Already in 1444 Cossacks of [[Ryazan]] were mentioned as defenders of [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]] against the units of [[Golden Horde]] and in a letter of [[Ivan III of Russia]] in 1502. The area around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] was divided between the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean west side]] and the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai east side]] after the Golden Horde fell in 1480. The vast steppe of the Don region was populated by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom, by people who were not satisfied with the existing social order. Over time, the culture of the Don Cossacks was formed into a united community and were called ""the Cossacks"".

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.

The total Cossack population in [[1893]] was 2,648,049 (including 1,331,470 women), and they owned nearly 146,500,000 acres of land, of which 105,000,000 acres were arable and 9,400,000 under forests. This land was divided between the stanitsas, at the rate of 81 acres per each soul, with special grants to officers (personal to some of them, in lieu of pensions), and leaving about one-third of the land as a reserve for the future. The income which the Cossack voiskos received from the lands which they rent to different persons, also from various sources (trade patents, rents of shops, fisheries, permits of gold-digging, etc.), as also from the subsidies they received from the government (about £712,500 in [[1893]]), was used to cover all the expenses of state and local administration. They had, besides, a special reserve capital of about £2,600,000. The expenditure of the village administration was covered by village taxes. The general administration was kept separately for each voisko, and differed with the different voiskos. The central administration, at the Ministry of War, was composed of representatives of each voisko, who discussed the proposals of all new laws affecting the Cossacks. 

In time of war the ten Cossack voiskos were bound to supply 890 mounted sotnias or squadrons (of 125 men each), 108 infantry sotnias or companies (also 125 men each), and 236 guns, representing 4267 officers and 177,100 men, with 170,695 horses. In time of peace they kept 314 squadrons, 54 infantry sotnias, and 20 batteries containing 108 guns (2574 officers, 60,532 men, 50,054 horses). Altogether, on the eve of [[World War I]] the Cossacks had 328,705 men ready to take arms. 

As a rule, popular education amongst the Cossacks stood at a higher level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Tisuri Cossacks) was sufficient to supply their needs and usually to left a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse breeding, vine culture in [[Caucasus]], fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the [[Caspian Sea]], hunting, bee-culture, etc. The extraction of coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories was mostly rented to strangers, who also owned most factories.

A military organization similar to that of the Cossacks was also introduced into certain districts, which supplied a number of mounted infantry [[sotnia]]s (""hundreds""). Their peace-footing on the eve of World War I was as follows: 

* [[Daghestan]], six regular squadrons and three of militia.
* [[Kuban]] [[Circassian]]s, one sotnia.
* [[Terek]], eight sotnias.
* [[Kars]], three sotnias.
* [[Batum]], two infantry and one mounted sotnia.

 {{Main|Registered Cossacks of the Russian Federation}}Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in Russia emerged numerous cossack communities all over the country. In Russia, both registered and unregistered communities identify with cossackism. The Cossack communities in Russia cooperate with each other as well as with the Russian Orthodox Church.

In the Russian Empire the Cossacks constituted ten separate [[voisko]]s, settled along the frontiers: [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kuban]], [[Terek]], [[Astrakhan]], [[Ural]], [[Orenburg]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Semiryechensk]], [[Amur]], and [[Ussuri]] voiskos. The primary unit of this organization was the ''stanitsa'', or village, which held its land as a commune, and might allow persons who were not Cossacks (excepting Jews) to settle on this land for payment of a certain rent. The assembly of all householders in villages of less than 30 households, and of 30 elected men in villages having from 30 to 300 households (one from each 10 households in the more populous ones), constituted the village assembly, similar to the [[mir (social)|mir]], but having wider attributes, which assessed the taxes, divided the land, took measures for the opening and support of schools, village grain-stores, communal cultivation, and so on, and elected its ataman (elder) and its judges, who settled all disputes up to an amount that the 1911 ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' gives as ""£10"" (or above that sum with the consent of both sides). 

Military service was obligatory for all men, for 20 years, beginning at the age of 18. The first 3 years were passed in the preliminary division, the next 12 in active service, and the last five years in the reserve. Every Cossack was bound to procure his own uniform, equipment and horse (if mounted), the government supplying only the arms. Those on active service were divided into three equal parts according to age, and only the first third (approxiately age 18-26) were normally in active service, while the rest were effectively reserves based at home but bound to march out as soon as an order was given. The officers were supplied by the military schools, in which all Cossack voiskos had their own vacancies, or were non-commissioned Cossack officers, with officers' grades. In return for this service the Cossacks received from the state considerable grants of land for each voisko separately.
