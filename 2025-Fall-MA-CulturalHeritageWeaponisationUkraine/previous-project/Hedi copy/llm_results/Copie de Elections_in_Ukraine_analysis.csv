 The most popular presidential elections were the first one in 1991 where voted nearly 30.6 millions people and in 2004 election which gathered some 28 millions. There were only three presidential candidates who have gathered over 10 millions votes: [[Leonid Kravchuk]] (1991 - 19.6, 1994 - 10.0), [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (2004 - 11.1), and [[Viktor Yanukovych]] (2004 - 11.0). The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only managed to gain trust of 9.6 millions. To this day Kravchuk is the only presidential candidate who managed to win the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes in 1991. Most often participant of presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who took part in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 millions, while in 2010 for him voted less than .1 million. Viktor Yanukiovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round who managed to pull a win in the second one.

-The most popular presidential elections were the first one in 1991 where voted nearly 30.6 millions people and in 2004 election which gathered some 28 millions. There were only three presidential candidates who have gathered over 10 millions votes: [[Leonid Kravchuk]] (1991 - 19.6, 1994 - 10.0), [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (2004 - 11.1), and [[Viktor Yanukovych]] (2004 - 11.0). The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only managed to gain trust of 9.6 millions. To this day Kravchuk is the only presidential candidate who managed to win the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes in 1991. Most often participant of presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who took part in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 millions, while in 2010 for him voted less than .1 million. Viktor Yanukiovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round who managed to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

-Voting analysis shows that during Ukrainian election there are traditional geographical voting patterns. [[Viktor Yanukovych]] (and his [[Party of the Regions]]) and [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] (and her party [[Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko]]) have been since about 2005 the main players in Ukrainian politics. Yanukovych traditional base of support is [[Ukraine|east]] and [[south Ukraine]], whereas Tymoshenko traditional base of support  is [[Ukraine|west]] and [[central Ukraine]].

-====Election results compared with the previous Ukrainian parliamentary election====
-
-In 2006, 27% of the registered vote represented support for minor parties that received less than the 3% statutory representation threshold. In 2007 the number of voters that supported minor parties that received less than the 3% statutory [[Election threshold|threshold]] (Including the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] the support of 2.86%) was only 7%.
-
-The 20% difference shows a consolidation of voter's support towards major political parties. This fact needs to be taken into consideration when making any assessment as to the positive swing recorded for [[Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko]], [[Party of Regions]], The [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] and [[Bloc Lytvyn]]. The [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] bloc merged with the new party ""[[Civil Movement ""People's Self-Defense""|People's Self-Defence]]"" but only recorded a marginal gain in the overall percentage of the vote representing a reduction of 236964 votes in comparison with the 2006 data.
-
-Further review of the regional vote shows a consolidation of the vote by [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] in regions in which her party already maintained strong support. Apart from the Socialist Party of Ukraine and a marginal gain by Our Ukraine all major political parties recorded an increase in the overall percentage the voter support when comparing the 2006 to 2007 results.
-
-The other fact that needs to also be considered is that in 2006 the [[Voter turnout|participation rate]] was 67% and in 2007 the participation rate dropped down to 62%.

The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only managed to gain trust of 9.6 millions. To this day Kravchuk is the only presidential candidate who managed to win the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes in 1991. Most often participant of presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who took part in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 millions, while in 2010 for him voted less than .1 million. Viktor Yanukiovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round who managed to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

-The most popular presidential elections were the first one in 1991 where nearly 30.6 millions people voted and in the 2004 election which gathered some 28 millions. There were only three presidential candidates who have gathered over 10 millions votes: [[Leonid Kravchuk]] (1991 - 19.6, 1994 - 10.0), [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (2004 - 11.1), and [[Viktor Yanukovych]] (2004 - 11.0). The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only managed to gain trust of 9.6 millions. To this day Kravchuk is the only presidential candidate who managed to win the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes in 1991. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 millions, while in 2010 for him voted less than 0.1 million. Viktor Yanukiovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round who managed to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

There were only three presidential candidates who have gathered over 10 millions votes: [[Leonid Kravchuk]] (1991 - 19.6, 1994 - 10.0), [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (2004 - 11.1), and [[Viktor Yanukovych]] (2004 - 11.0). The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only managed to gain trust of 9.6 millions. To this day Kravchuk and [[Petro Poroshenko]] are the only presidential candidates who managed to win the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 millions, while in 2010 for him voted less than 0.1 million. Viktor Yanukiovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round who managed to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only managed to gain trust of 9.6 millions. To this day Kravchuk and [[Petro Poroshenko]] are the only presidential candidates who managed to win the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 millions, while in 2010 for him voted less than 0.1 million. Viktor Yanukiovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round who managed to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

-The most popular presidential elections were the first one in 1991 where nearly 30.6 millions people voted and in the 2004 election which gathered some 28 millions. There were only three presidential candidates who have gathered over 10 millions votes: [[Leonid Kravchuk]] (1991 - 19.6, 1994 - 10.0), [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (2004 - 11.1), and [[Viktor Yanukovych]] (2004 - 11.0). The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only managed to gain trust of 9.6 millions. To this day Kravchuk and [[Petro Poroshenko]] are the only presidential candidates who managed to win the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 millions, while in 2010 for him voted less than 0.1 million. Viktor Yanukiovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round who managed to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only managed to gain trust of 9.6 millions. To this day Kravchuk and [[Petro Poroshenko]] are the only presidential candidates who managed to win the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 millions, while in 2010 for him voted less than 0.1 million. Viktor Yanukiovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round who managed to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

 ==Voting patterns==
 Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] politically dominated most of Ukraine. By mid 1990s the communists completely lost popularity in western Ukraine, which voted for any representative but communist.

The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only gained the trust of 9.6 millions. To this day Kravchuk and [[Petro Poroshenko]] are the only presidential candidates who won the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 million, while in 2010 less than 0.1 million voted for him. Viktor Yanukovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only gained the trust of 9.6 million. To this day Kravchuk and [[Petro Poroshenko]] are the only presidential candidates who won the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 million, while in 2010 less than 0.1 million voted for him. Viktor Yanukovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

 ==Voting patterns==
 Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] politically dominated most of Ukraine. By mid 1990s the communists completely lost popularity in western Ukraine, which voted for any representative but communist. Since [[Leonid Kuchma]] left presidential post, in 2004 support for the Communist Party shifted towards the [[Party of Regions]] being politically dominating mostly over the southeastern Ukraine. At the same time initially led by the [[People's Movement of Ukraine]], political leadership in the non-communist camp was taken over by [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] bloc and [[Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko]].

To this day Kravchuk and [[Petro Poroshenko]] are the only presidential candidates who won the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 million, while in 2010 less than 0.1 million voted for him. Viktor Yanukovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

 ==Voting patterns==
 Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] politically dominated most of Ukraine. By mid 1990s the communists completely lost popularity in western Ukraine, which voted for any representative but communist. Since [[Leonid Kuchma]] left presidential post, in 2004 support for the Communist Party shifted towards the [[Party of Regions]] being politically dominating mostly over the southeastern Ukraine. At the same time initially led by the [[People's Movement of Ukraine]], political leadership in the non-communist camp was taken over by [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] bloc and [[Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko]].
 
-In the elections since 2002 voters of Western and Central Ukrainian oblasts voted mostly for parties ([[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]], [[All-Ukrainian Union ""Fatherland""|Batkivshchyna]], [[UDAR]], [[Self Reliance (political party)|Self Reliance]], [[Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko|Radical Party]], [[Petro Poroshenko Bloc]] and the [[People's Front (Ukraine)|People's Front]]) and presidential candidates ([[Viktor Yuschenko]], [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]) with a pro-Western and state reform [[Political platform|platform]], while voters in Southern and Eastern oblasts of Ukraine voted for parties ([[Communist Party of Ukraine|CPU]], [[Party of Regions]] and [[Opposition Bloc]]) and presidential candidates ([[Viktor Yanukovych]]) with a pro-Russian and [[status quo]] platform.<ref name=""Olszanski AE""/><ref>[http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vnd2012/WP406?PT001F01=900&pf7171=52 Центральна виборча комісія України - WWW відображення ІАС ""Вибори народних депутатів України 2012""<!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом -->]<br>{{cite web|date=30 August 2012|title=CEC substitutes Tymoshenko, Lutsenko in voting papers|url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2012/08/30/111349.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813233711/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2012/08/30/111349.html|archivedate=13 August 2014|deadurl=y|accessdate=6 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=EWparties>[https://books.google.com/books?id=H23Pv4Ik3vMC&pg=PA396&dq=Ukrainian++parties+pro-Western+Bloc&hl=nl&ei=8OdZTczRCMueOteptKIL&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Ukrainian%20%20parties%20pro-Western%20Bloc&f=false Communist and Post-Communist Parties in Europe] by [[Uwe Backes]] and [[Patrick Moreau]], [[Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-525-36912-8}} (page 396)</ref><ref name=Umland>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/andreas-umland/ukraine-right-wing-politics-is-genie-out-of-bottle Ukraine right-wing politics: is the genie out of the bottle?], [[openDemocracy.net]] (January 3, 2011)</ref><ref name=""KuzioPORvotersdontgoaway"">[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=39981 Eight Reasons Why Ukraine’s Party of Regions Will Win the 2012 Elections] by [[Taras Kuzio]], [[The Jamestown Foundation]] (17 October 2012)<br>[http://www.taraskuzio.net/media20_files/8.pdf UKRAINE: Yushchenko needs Tymoshenko as ally again] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515074305/http://www.taraskuzio.net/media20_files/8.pdf |date=2013-05-15 }} by [[Taras Kuzio]], [[Oxford Analytica]] (5 October 2007)</ref><ref name=""Olszanski AE""/><ref>[http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/eastweek/2012-11-07/after-parliamentary-elections-ukraine-a-tough-victory-party-regions After the parliamentary elections in Ukraine: a tough victory for the Party of Regions], [[Centre for Eastern Studies]] (7 November 2012)</ref> Although this geographical division is decreasing.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/59340/ Election winner lacks strong voter mandate], [[Kyiv Post]] (February 11, 2010)<br>[http://www.euractiv.com/specialreport-eu-ukraine-relatio/ukraines-party-regions-pyrrhic-v-analysis-516103 Ukraine's Party of Regions: A pyrrhic victory], [[EurActiv.com]] (16 November 2012)<br>[http://www.dw.de/ukraine-vote-ushers-in-new-constellation-of-power/a-16341696 Ukraine vote ushers in new constellation of power], [[Deutsche Welle]] (30 October 2012)</ref><ref name=""Olszanski AE""/><ref>{{Citation |first=Tadeusz A. |last=Olszański |title=Poroshenko, President of Ukraine |publisher=OSW—Centre for Eastern Studies |date=28 May 2014 |url=http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2014-05-28/poroshenko-president-ukraine}}</ref> Till the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] the electorate of CPU and Party of Regions was very loyal to them.<ref name=""KuzioPORvotersdontgoaway""/> But in the 2014 parliamentary election Party of Regions did not to participate (because of a perceived lack of legitimacy (of the election), because not every resident of the [[Donbas]] could vote) and the CPU came 1.12% short of the 5% election threshold.<ref name=""General official results of Rada election 2014"">[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233747.html General official results of Rada election], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (11 November 2014)<br>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233696.html Central Election Commission announces official results of Rada election on party tickets], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (11 November 2014)</ref><ref>[http://en.ria.ru/politics/20140914/192930339/Ukraines-Party-of-Regions-Refuses-to-Participate-in-Rada.html Ukraine's Party of Regions Refuses to Participate in Rada Elections], [[RIA Novosti]] (23 September 2014)</ref> The results were a victory for the pro-Western parties and a major defeat for the pro-Russian camp.

The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 million, while in 2010 less than 0.1 million voted for him. Viktor Yanukovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

 ==Voting patterns==
 Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] politically dominated most of Ukraine. By mid 1990s the communists completely lost popularity in western Ukraine, which voted for any representative but communist. Since [[Leonid Kuchma]] left presidential post, in 2004 support for the Communist Party shifted towards the [[Party of Regions]] being politically dominating mostly over the southeastern Ukraine. At the same time initially led by the [[People's Movement of Ukraine]], political leadership in the non-communist camp was taken over by [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] bloc and [[Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko]].

 ==Voting patterns==
 Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] politically dominated most of Ukraine. By mid 1990s the communists completely lost popularity in western Ukraine, which voted for any representative but communist. Since [[Leonid Kuchma]] left presidential post, in 2004 support for the Communist Party shifted towards the [[Party of Regions]] being politically dominating mostly over the southeastern Ukraine. At the same time initially led by the [[People's Movement of Ukraine]], political leadership in the non-communist camp was taken over by [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] bloc and [[Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko]].

The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only gained the trust of 9.6 million. To this day Kravchuk and [[Petro Poroshenko]] are the only presidential candidates who won the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 million, while in 2010 less than 0.1 million voted for him. Viktor Yanukovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

 ==Voting patterns==
 Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] politically dominated most of Ukraine. By mid 1990s the communists completely lost popularity in western Ukraine, which voted for any representative but communist.

The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only gained the trust of 9.6 million. To this day Kravchuk and [[Petro Poroshenko]] are the only presidential candidates who won the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 million, while in 2010 less than 0.1 million voted for him. Viktor Yanukovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

 ==Voting patterns==
 Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] politically dominated most of Ukraine. By mid 1990s the communists completely lost popularity in western Ukraine, which voted for any representative but communist. Since [[Leonid Kuchma]] left presidential post, in 2004 support for the Communist Party shifted towards the [[Party of Regions]] being politically dominating mostly over the southeastern Ukraine. At the same time initially led by the [[People's Movement of Ukraine]], political leadership in the non-communist camp was taken over by [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] bloc and [[Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko]].

To this day Kravchuk and [[Petro Poroshenko]] are the only presidential candidates who won the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 million, while in 2010 less than 0.1 million voted for him. Viktor Yanukovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round to pull a win in the second one.

 ==Voting patterns==
 Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] politically dominated most of Ukraine. By mid 1990s the communists completely lost popularity in western Ukraine, which voted for any representative but communist. Since [[Leonid Kuchma]] left presidential post, in 2004 support for the Communist Party shifted towards the [[Party of Regions]] being politically dominating mostly over the southeastern Ukraine. At the same time initially led by the [[People's Movement of Ukraine]], political leadership in the non-communist camp was taken over by [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] bloc and [[Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko]].
 
-In the elections since 2002 voters of Western and Central Ukrainian oblasts voted mostly for parties ([[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]], [[All-Ukrainian Union ""Fatherland""|Batkivshchyna]], [[Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform|UDAR]], [[Self Reliance (political party)|Self Reliance]], [[Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko|Radical Party]], [[European Solidarity|Petro Poroshenko Bloc]] and the [[People's Front (Ukraine)|People's Front]]) and presidential candidates ([[Viktor Yushchenko]], [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]) with a pro-Western and state reform [[Party platform|platform]], while voters in Southern and Eastern oblasts of Ukraine voted for parties ([[Communist Party of Ukraine|CPU]], [[Party of Regions]] and [[Opposition Bloc]]) and presidential candidates ([[Viktor Yanukovych]]) with a pro-Russian and [[status quo]] platform.<ref name=""Olszanski AE""/><ref>[http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vnd2012/WP406?PT001F01=900&pf7171=52 Центральна виборча комісія України -

 ==Voting patterns==
 Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] politically dominated most of Ukraine. By mid 1990s the communists completely lost popularity in western Ukraine, which voted for any representative but communist. Since [[Leonid Kuchma]] left presidential post, in 2004 support for the Communist Party shifted towards the [[Party of Regions]] being politically dominating mostly over the southeastern Ukraine. At the same time initially led by the [[People's Movement of Ukraine]], political leadership in the non-communist camp was taken over by [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] bloc and [[Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko]].
 
-In the elections since 2002 voters of Western and Central Ukrainian oblasts voted mostly for parties ([[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]], [[All-Ukrainian Union ""Fatherland""|Batkivshchyna]], [[Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform|UDAR]], [[Self Reliance (political party)|Self Reliance]], [[Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko|Radical Party]], [[European Solidarity|Petro Poroshenko Bloc]] and the [[People's Front (Ukraine)|People's Front]]) and presidential candidates ([[Viktor Yushchenko]], [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]) with a pro-Western and state reform [[Party platform|platform]], while voters in Southern and Eastern oblasts of Ukraine voted for parties ([[Communist Party of Ukraine|CPU]], [[Party of Regions]] and [[Opposition Bloc]]) and presidential candidates ([[Viktor Yanukovych]]) with a pro-Russian and [[status quo]] platform.<ref name=""Olszanski AE""/><ref>[http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vnd2012/WP406?PT001F01=900&pf7171=52 Центральна виборча комісія України -

The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only gained the trust of 9.6 million. To this day Kravchuk and [[Petro Poroshenko]] are the only presidential candidates who won the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 million, while in 2010 less than 0.1 million voted for him. Viktor Yanukovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

 ==Voting patterns==
 Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] politically dominated most of Ukraine. By mid 1990s the communists completely lost popularity in western Ukraine, which voted for any representative but communist. Since [[Leonid Kuchma]] left presidential post, in 2004 support for the Communist Party shifted towards the [[Party of Regions]] being politically dominating mostly over the southeastern Ukraine. At the same time initially led by the [[People's Movement of Ukraine]], political leadership in the non-communist camp was taken over by [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] bloc and [[Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko]].

 ==Voting patterns==
 Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] politically dominated most of Ukraine. By mid 1990s the communists completely lost popularity in western Ukraine, which voted for any representative but communist. Since [[Leonid Kuchma]] left presidential post, in 2004 support for the Communist Party shifted towards the [[Party of Regions]] being politically dominating mostly over the southeastern Ukraine. At the same time initially led by the [[People's Movement of Ukraine]], political leadership in the non-communist camp was taken over by [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] bloc and [[Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko]].

There were only three presidential candidates who have gathered over 10 million votes: [[Leonid Kravchuk]] (1991 - 19.6, 1994 - 10.0), [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (2004 - 11.1), and [[Viktor Yanukovych]] (2004 - 11.0). The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only gained the trust of 9.6 million. To this day Kravchuk and [[Petro Poroshenko]] are the only presidential candidates who won the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 million, while in 2010 less than 0.1 million voted for him. Viktor Yanukovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.
