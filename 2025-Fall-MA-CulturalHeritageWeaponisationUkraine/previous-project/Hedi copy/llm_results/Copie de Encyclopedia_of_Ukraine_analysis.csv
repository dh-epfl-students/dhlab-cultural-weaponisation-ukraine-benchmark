 The ''Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine'' is an [[English language]], free online encyclopedia covering wide range of issues on [[Ukraine]], including its history, people, geography, economy, culture, etc. Upon completion, the ''IEU'' will become the most authoritative and comprehensive Internet-based resource in English on Ukraine and Ukrainians. Currently it contains some 6,000 entries and 5,000 illustrations. ",/* Description */,Aleksandr Grigoryev,2016-01-29T08:43:43Z,"The change made is a rephrasing of the section title from ""Description"" to ""English variant"" and a slight modification in the text to clarify that the English version was created between 1984 and 1993. 

**Justification**: The revision emphasizes the English version of the encyclopedia, which could be seen as an attempt to highlight the Ukrainian perspective in a way that may downplay or reframe the context of Russian influence or narratives. However, the change itself does not contain overtly weaponized language or narratives.
