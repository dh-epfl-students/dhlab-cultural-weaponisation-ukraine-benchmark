"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe. [http://www.ycgeneration.com/yc2006/guests_zk.asp]

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571]
[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.
+In Spetember 1992 an outreach began in the October Palace in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre, Australian Worship Leader David Evans, USA Pastor Mike Berry along with Former Hills Youth Pastor Darko culjak.

From this outreach Darko Culjak planted the church officially on [[October 4]], [[1992]] Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until it's indigenious leaders could take over the work. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], Darko turned the church over to one of the first converts from the early outreaches, a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.
 
 As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000.

===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007.

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007.

Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums.

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007.

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until its indigenious leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe. [http://www.ycgeneration.com/yc2006/guests_zk.asp]

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571]
[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

This particular outreach was also assisted by [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[CBN]]'s television outreach into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak planted the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on [[October 4]], [[1992]]. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until its indigenious leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], Darko turned the church over to one of the first converts from the early outreaches, a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe.

Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe.

Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].
 
 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, USA pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on [[October 4]], [[1992]]. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until its indigenous leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

 As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000.

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571]
[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe.

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].
 
 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, USA pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on [[October 4]], [[1992]]. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until its indigenous leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

Australian worship leader David Evans, USA pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until its locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church.

===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007.

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

Australian worship leader David Evans, USA pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe. [http://www.ycgeneration.com/yc2006/guests_zk.asp]

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].
 
 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, USA pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe.

The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger.

===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, USA pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church.

===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, USA pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church. 
 
 As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe. <ref>[http://www.ycgeneration.com/yc2006/guests_zk.asp YC Alberta 2006: TELL THE WORLD]</ref>

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe.

The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe.

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].
 
 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, USA pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].
 
 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, USA pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

 As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000.

Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 ==History==
 In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, USA pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe. [http://www.ycgeneration.com/yc2006/guests_zk.asp]

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571]
[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, USA pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.
 
 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church. In February, 2014, Zhenya and Vera resigned, and Yuriy and Tetiana Ravnushkin were appointed as the new Lead Pastors of Hillsong Kiev.

Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe.

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.
 
 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

 ==History==
 In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.
 
 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000.

Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe. [http://www.ycgeneration.com/yc2006/guests_zk.asp]

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers.

===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

 ==History==
 In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, USA pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700 seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe.

The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe.

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 ==History==
 In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700-seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on 4 October 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On 1 June 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe. [http://www.ycgeneration.com/yc2006/guests_zk.asp]

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571]
[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 ==History==
 In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700-seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on 4 October 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On 1 June 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church.

===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000.

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.
 
 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700-seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on October 4, 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On June 1, 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe. [http://www.ycgeneration.com/yc2006/guests_zk.asp]

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571]
[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 ==History==
 In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700-seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on 4 October 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On 1 June 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny Zhenya and Vera Kasevich, who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe.

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.
 
 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kiev|October Palace]] in Kiev with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700-seat movie theatre in downtown Kiev. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on 4 October 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kiev's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On 1 June 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kyiv]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.
 
 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kyiv|October Palace]] in Kyiv with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700-seat movie theatre in downtown Kyiv. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on 4 October 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kyiv's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the spiritual guidance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia as autonomous independent Ukrainian church. On 1 June 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny Zhenya and Vera Kasevich, who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kyiv]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.
 
 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kyiv|October Palace]] in Kyiv with team members from [[Hills Christian Life Centre]] (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700-seat movie theatre in downtown Kyiv. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on 4 October 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kyiv's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come as independent Ukrainian church under the spiritual guidance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On 1 June 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Ievgenii (Zhenya) and Vera Kasevich, who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000.

Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007.

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kyiv]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.

Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700-seat movie theatre in downtown Kyiv. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on 4 October 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kyiv's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the spiritual guidance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia as Independent Ukrainian church. On 1 June 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny Zhenya and Vera Kasevich, who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

On 1 June 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Ievgenii (Zhenya) and Vera Kasevich, who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Culjak left and spent some rest time in the US until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700-seat movie theatre in downtown Kyiv. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on 4 October 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kyiv's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the spiritual guidance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia as Independent Ukrainian church. On 1 June 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny Zhenya and Vera Kasevich, who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new senior pastors of the church.

 '''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kyiv]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.
 
 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kyiv|October Palace]] in Kyiv with team members from Hills Christian Life Centre (now known as Hillsong Church).  Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700-seat movie theatre in downtown Kyiv. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on 4 October 1992. Darko Culjak lead the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kyiv's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come under the guidance and governance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On 1 June 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny Zhenya and Vera Kasevich, who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Pastor Darko left and spent some rest time in the USA until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church.

Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe.

Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe. [http://www.ycgeneration.com/yc2006/guests_zk.asp]

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe.

Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 ==History==
-In September 1992, an outreach began in the [[October Palace, Kyiv]] with team members from [[Hills Christian Life Centre]] (now known as Hillsong Church). Australian worship leader David Evans, US pastor Mike Berry and former Hillsong youth pastor Darko Culjak as a part of Hillsong's Nation Builders mission outreach officially began the church in a 700-seat movie theatre in downtown Kyiv. But none of this would have been possible without the assistance of [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]] and their television ministry into the [[former Soviet Union]] under Steve Webber. Through their assistance hundreds of young people committed their lives to Christ. Out of these initial outreaches Darko Culjak became the senior minister and established the church (then called ""Kiev Christian Life Centre"") officially on 4 October 1992. Culjak led the church, raised up a ministry team from among the new converts and oversaw the new church until Kyiv's locally educated leaders could take over the work and come as independent Ukrainian church under the spiritual guidance of Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. On 1 June 1997, Darko turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Ievgenii (Zhenya) and Vera Kasevich, who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new pastors of the church. After their appointment, Culjak left and spent some rest time in the US until he returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe. [http://www.ycgeneration.com/yc2006/guests_zk.asp]

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571]
[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

 In February 2014, the Kasevichs wanted the Kyiv church to retain its independence, but Brian Houston said that if they broke away, he would open a rival Hillsong church in the city. They felt they had no choice but to hand over the churches and assets and resign, as they did not want to break up the congregation. Hillsong records later showed that Hillsong Church requested a ""voluntary donation"" of the proceeds of the sale of a property, as well as over $US230,000 in cash. The Kasevichs wanted to emigrate to the United States, and there is evidence that Hillsong said that they could make things difficult for the couple with the American authorities, although Houston later denied this.<ref name=""Cohen 2022""/>

 ",,BilletsMauves,2024-10-22T14:34:46Z,"The change made in this revision is the replacement of ""Kiev"" with ""Kyiv"" throughout the text, which is a shift towards using the Ukrainian spelling of the city's name. 

**Weaponised**: The use of ""Kyiv"" instead of ""Kiev"" aligns with a broader narrative of recognizing and respecting Ukrainian sovereignty and identity, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict with Russia. This change can be seen as a subtle assertion of cultural heritage and national identity, which is often weaponized in discussions surrounding the Ukraine-Russia conflict.",Weaponised
"'''Hillsong Church Kiev''' (formerly '''Kiev Christian Life Centre''') is the [[Kiev]]-based offshoot of [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==History==
The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe. [http://www.ycgeneration.com/yc2006/guests_zk.asp]

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.

The church was started on [[October 4]], [[1992]] by a team from Hillsong Australia, leaving Pastor Darko Culjak to oversee the new church. On [[June 1]], [[1997]], he turned the church over to a Ukrainian couple - Yevgeny ([[Zhenya Kasevich|Zhenya]]) and [[Vera Kasevich]], who had been with the church since the day it was planted and have thus become the new Senior Pastors of the church. Pastor Darko returned to Australia to pastor the Newcastle City Church.

As of 2007, the church holds 6 to 7 services each weekend (the number changes from season to season) with a combined attendance of around 3000. Pastors Zhenya and Vera have since gained an international recognition and are being invited to speak at various churches and Christian conferences around the globe.

==Ministries==
Hillsong Kiev tries to align its ministries structure with that of the mother church in Sydney. There are 3-part courses for new believers, named ""Discovery"". The church reflects the belief that small ""connect groups"" are essential for the fellowship spirit within the church, especially as it gets larger. Connect groups and sometimes special services are held for people of various ages and with various interests, such as youth, or ""people over 40"", or those who like fishing or computers. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/ministries/index.html] Hillsong Kiev is characterized by a high level of involvement of its members in serving at the church and is believed by observers to have the best level of the organization of ministry among all Protestant churches in Europe.

[[Image:Hillsongkievconference2006.jpg|thumb|Praise and worship during the opening night of Hillsong Conference in Kiev, 2006]]
===Conferences===
As both [[Hillsong Church|Hillsong Australia]] and [[Hillsong London]], Hillsong Kiev holds 3 yearly conferences: the Hillsong Conference, the Colour Your World conference for women, and a men's conference. The Hillsong Conference, meant to equip other churches with both Biblical teaching and practical advice on organizing the life of a church, gathered about 3000 delegates from more than 250 churches from 12 countries, mainly representing the former Soviet bloc, in 2006.

===Social work===
Hillsong Kiev is making considerable efforts to be a servant to the community by helping orphanages in Kiev and Kiev area, supporting sick people in hospitals treating cancer, reaching out to homeless children and inmates in correctional centers.[http://www.hillsong.com.ua/transforminglives/index.php?r=TransformingLives]

===Bible college===
The church has a Bible college offering a 1- to 3-year studies plan, meant mainly for those who wish to serve in the church, although participation in ministry at the ""helps"" level is not contingent on a person's completing a study course. Students from Protestant churches of other cities of Ukraine as well as other former Soviet-bloc countries also come for training.

The first year offers a basic study course on the main topics of the (neo)Protestant doctrine, with evening classes conducted once a week. The second year offers a more solid course in both theology and ministerial practice. The third year is meant for those aiming at full-time ministry and recommended by church leadership.

==Offshoot in Moscow==
On [[March 1]], [[2007]], Hillsong Kiev launched its first service in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with subsequent large services, attended both by interested Christians from other churches and  new people, held in April and May. [http://www.risu.org.ua/rus/news/article;16887/] Successfully completing the registration process, in June 2007, the church started holding a weekly service, with an attendance of slightly over 100 as of August 2007. The church plant was cooperatively supported by the Moscow-based Good News Church pastored by [[Rick Renner]]. [http://www.bible.com.ua/news/r/35571], [http://news.invictory.org/issue13083.html]

The church in Moscow is also pastored by Zhenya and Vera Kasevich. They spend part of the week in Kiev and part of the week in Moscow.

==Music==
Hillsong Kiev, as of August 2007, has recorded 16 various albums, including youth and children's albums. Mainly, the songs on the albums are translations of the songs written at Hillsong Australia and, recently, Hillsong London, but there are also original songs written mainly by Vera Kasevich, who also serves as the church's worship pastor, and her and Zhenya's son Roman Kasevich.

The 17th album, recorded live at Hillsong Conference Kiev in 2006, is planned to be released in the fall of 2007.

==Venues==
Hillsong Kiev does not yet own a worship center, renting a public hall in [[Kiev]] downtown for its services. It does own an office, purchased in 2002 with the help of both contributors from the church itself, and supporters abroad. [http://www.hillsong.com.ua/church/venues.html]

==Criticism==
The criticism of the Hillsong Church Kiev is similar to the criticism expressed with regard to the mother church in Australia (by Australian churches belonging to other denominations) and reflects the general disapproval of certain aspects of what [[Pentecostal|Pentecostals]]/[[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]] believe in from the more traditional Protestant denominations. In particular, the teaching on prosperity is the target of attacks. It must be noted, however, that Hillsong church does not hold the beliefs popularly described as [[Word of Faith|Word-of-Faith movement]], stressing the sovereignty of God and the fulfilling of God's will for the life of each individual believer as the main content of Christian life, which does include hardships and the willingness of the believer to do without. At the same time, the church believes that God does equip the believer with the means necessary for the fulfillment of God's will, a chief part of which is doing good works and helping those in need.
