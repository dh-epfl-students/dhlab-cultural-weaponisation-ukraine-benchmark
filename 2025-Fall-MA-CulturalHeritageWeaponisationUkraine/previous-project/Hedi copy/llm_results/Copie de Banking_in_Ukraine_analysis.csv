+The of '''banking in [[Ukraine]]''' since [[Ukrainian independence]] in [[1991]] saw two major waves of bank mergers and acquisitions.<ref name=""Banking in Ukraine ref #1"">[http://ukrainianweek.com/Economics/148364 Merge and Acquire], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (9 October 2015)</ref>  The first one took place before the [[2008-2009 global financial crisis]] when stakes in Ukrainian banks were mostly acquired by foreign firms who hoped that the [[Ukrainian economy]] and banking system would soon begin to grow rapidly and had cheap cash to bring to Ukraine and lend out. The owners were willing to sell banks because they were offered good prices, and they were aware of the low quality of their assets, but preferred to keep investors uninformed of that. At that point, Ukraine’s banking system was a market of sellers: investors would buy banks at prices that were five to seven times above their actual value.
+
+The second spate came under the Yanukovych regime and was of a completely different nature. Bank owners, mostly foreigners by now, no longer believed that the banking sector and economy overall had any prospects in Ukraine under the then government. They were fleeing the country and selling assets to Ukrainian businessmen close to the government. These new buyers had much better prospects thanks to friends in power. That was the market of buyers who paid 0.5-1.0 of the bank’s capital worth for an institution. After the regime collapsed and Ukraine tumbled into a full-scale financial and economic crisis, mergers and acquisitions of banks virtually stopped. The owners were struggling to clean up the mess they had on their hands and keep what they had afloat. Potential buyers saw no sense in acquiring credit facilities with unattractive balance sheets and obscure prospects operating in an extremely difficult environment.
+
+The fact that mergers and acquisitions resume in Ukraine’s banking sector signals that there is a number of agents (buyers) who see good prospects in the country’s economy and financial sector, or believe that benefits are far more likely than the risk of continued recession and bankruptcies. Confident of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, they want to do deals quickly, before economic revival becomes obvious and the assets go up in price. There is also another category of agents (sellers) who do not believe in Ukraine’s prospects overall, or in the short run. As a result, the market for mergers and acquisition has acquired some balance, even if as fragile as Ukraine’s economic balance achieved recently.
+
+Drivers of foreign interest
+
+Foreign investors still have different motives for acquiring banks in Ukraine. NCH Capital intends to create a bank focusing on lending to agribusiness. The company has been working with agriculture in Ukraine for many years. It now hopes to benefit from a synergy of expertise it has accumulated and the bank it just acquired. The Ukrainian Week’s sources claim that NCH has long been looking for a bank to buy in Ukraine but was asked exorbitant prices under Yanukovych. Now, it sees a good opportunity to implement its plans at minimal cost. The management board headquartered in New York eyes the deal with a lot of skepticism but relies on the Kyiv office managers for this decision so far. It is to be seen how well the local team copes with the task. However, the move is undoubtedly well-justified.
+
+The UAE investors’ deal with UkrGazPromBank is less straightforward. Many experts doubt that Primestar Energy FZE is the ultimate beneficiary of the newly-acquired bank. The company may well be acting in the interests of people who are much closer to Ukraine than the residents of the UAE. On the other hand, Arabic investors are flush with cash accumulated over the period of high oil prices. Primestar Energy FZE is in the oil trade business itself. It may be looking to acquire depreciated assets in countries like the post-crisis Ukraine since projects elsewhere are far more expensive. Moreover, Arab investors have already shown interest in the privatization campaign the Government is preparing in Ukraine.

+==Background==

+Banking in Ukraine traces its history back to 22 December 1917, when the [[Central Council of Ukraine]] adopted a law ""On the transformation of the [[Kyiv]] office of the Russian State Bank into the Ukrainian State Bank"". The Ukrainian State Bank took over the functions of the (Russian) State Bank, Noble Land Bank, and Peasant Land Bank. The [[Central Executive Committee of Ukraine]] issued a decree nationalizing banks on 14 December 1917. On 5 January 1918, the Ukrainian State Bank started to issue its own money. On 10 August 1918, a statute was signed on the Ukrainian State Bank. On 23 August 1918, the State Land Bank was established.

+At the end of [[World War I]], [[Ukraine]] was occupied by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], which operated a policy of [[War Communism]]; banks were not permitted. However, in 1921 branches of the State Bank of the Russian SFSR started to be established across Ukraine. Later these became branches of the [[Gosbank|Central Bank of the USSR]].

+In the [[1980s]], before the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] and during the time of [[perestroika]], the National Bank of Ukraine was a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republic-level]] branch of the [[Gosbank|Central Bank of the USSR]], while there were other financial institutions of varying status. There were more than 15 banks of ministerial status, over 20 banks of state/cooperative institutions, banks of other Republics operating in Ukraine, and other state-recognized banks. The National Bank of Ukraine took on central banking functions in Ukraine in early 1991. Like institutions of many newly independent nations, it faced dire financial straits during the 1990s, leading to a prolonged period of [[hyperinflation]].
