The great celebrations in [[Moscow]] changed the character of relationship between the Soviet state and the church. For the first time since 1917, numerous churches and monasteries were returned to the [[Russian Orthodoxy]]. In Ukrainian communities around the world, members of various [[History of Christianity in Ukraine |Ukrainian churches]] also celebrated the Millennium of Eastern Slavic Christianity.

[[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity among all the others and his [[idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace, where human sacrifices were reported. For disputed reasons, Vladimir's reform of Russian paganism failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to seek state religion abroad.
 
-[[Image:Kiev vasnetcov.jpg|250px|thumb|The Baptism of Kievans by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]
-To commemorate the event, Vladimir built the first stone [[church]] of Kievan Rus', called the [[Church of the Tithes]] (''Desyatynna Tserkva''), where his body and the body of his wife, Princess Anna, the sister of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Basil II]], were to repose. Another church was built on top of the hill where pagan statues stood before.
+The [[Primary Chronicle]] reports that in the year [[987]], as the result of a consultation with his [[boyar]]s, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Of the [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]] the envoys reported there is no gladness among them; only sorrow and a great stench, and that their religion was undesirable due to its [[taboo]] against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus'."" Russian sources also describe Vladimir consulting with [[Jewish]] envoys (who may or may not have been [[Khazars]]), and questioning them about their religion but ultimately rejecting it, saying that their loss of [[Jerusalem]] was evidence of their having been abandoned by [[God]]. Ultimately Vladimir settled on [[Christianity]]. In the churches of the Germans his emissaries saw no beauty; but at [[Hagia Sophia]], where the full festival ritual of the Byzantine Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: ''""We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth,""'' they reported, ''""nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it.""'' If Vladimir was impressed by this account of his envoys, he was yet more so by political gains of the Byzantine alliance.

In 987, [[Bardas Sclerus]] and [[Bardas Phocas]] revolted against the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]]. Both rebels briefly joined forces, but then Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor on [[September 14]], [[987]]. Basil II turned to the Rus for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Orthodox Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

+The account of Vladimir's baptism in the Primary Chronicle is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to obtain the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir negotiated for the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Greek princess. Returning to Kiev in triumph, he destroyed pagan monuments and established many churches, starting with the splendid [[Church of the Tithes]] (989).
+
+==== Baptism of Kiev ====
+[[Image:Kiev vasnetcov.jpg|200px|thumb|''The Baptism of Kievans'', a fresco from [[St. Vladimir's Cathedral]].]]
+
+Upon his return to the capital, Vladimir exhorted the residents to the [[Dnieper]] river for [[baptism]]. This mass baptism became the [[icon]]ic inaugural event in the forced Christianization of the state of [[Kievan Rus']]. 
+
+At first Vladimir baptised his 12 sons and many [[boyar]]s. He destroyed the wooden statues of [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan gods]] (which he had himself raised just eight years earlier).  They were either burnt or hacked into pieces, and the statue of Perun &mdash; the supreme god &mdash; was thrown into the Dnieper. Then he sent a message to all residents of Kiev, ""rich, and poor, and beggars, and slaves"", to come to the river on the following day, lest they risk becoming the ""prince's enemies"". Large number of people came; some even brought infants with them. They were sent into the water while Orthodox priests, who came from Chersonesos for the occasion, prayed.
+
+To commemorate the event, Vladimir built the first stone [[church]] of Kievan Rus', called the [[Church of the Tithes]] (''Desyatynna Tserkva''), where his body and the body of his new wife were to repose. Another church was built on top of the hill where pagan statues stood before.
+
+== Aftermath ==
+
+The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other centres of the country. The [[Ioakim Chronicle]] says that Vladimir's uncle, [[Dobrynya]], forced the [[Novgorod]]ians into Christianity ""by fire"", while the local mayor, [[Putyata]], persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith ""by sword"". The heritage of paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred in [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new teaching. [[Image:Sophia iznutri.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] (1037-54) was the mother church of Kievan Rus'.]]
+
+The Christianisation of Kievan Rus' firmly allied it with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Greek culture was adopted in Kiev and other centres of the country. Churches started to be built on the Byzantine model. During the reign of Vladimir's son [[Yaroslav I]], Metropolitan [[Ilarion]] authored the first known work of East Slavic literature, in which he compared his country to other lands. The [[Ostromir Codex]], dated to about the same period, was the first dated East Slavic book. But the only work of lay literature, ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'', testifies to the survival of pagan traditions under this Christian facade.
 
 In [[1988]], the faithful of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches which have roots in the baptism of Kiev celebrated a millennium of Eastern Slavic Christianity. The great celebrations in [[Moscow]] changed the character of relationship between the Soviet state and the church. For the first time since 1917, numerous churches and monasteries were returned to the [[Russian Orthodoxy]]. In Ukrainian communities around the world, members of various [[History of Christianity in Ukraine |Ukrainian churches]] also celebrated the Millennium of Eastern Slavic Christianity.

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus, their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the [[Primary Chronicle]] were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by [[944]]. In the [[Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kievan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time.

 ==== Background ====
 
-During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity among all the others and his [[idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace, where human sacrifices were reported. For disputed reasons, Vladimir's reform of Russian paganism failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to seek state religion abroad.
+During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. Although Vladimir seems to have gone further than both Scandinavian [[konung]]s (even human sacrifices were reported in Kiev), his religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.
 
-The [[Primary Chronicle]] reports that in the year [[987]], as the result of a consultation with his [[boyar]]s, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Of the [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]] the envoys reported there is no gladness among them; only sorrow and a great stench, and that their religion was undesirable due to its [[taboo]] against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus'."" Russian sources also describe Vladimir consulting with [[Jewish]] envoys (who may or may not have been [[Khazars]]), and questioning them about their religion but ultimately rejecting it, saying that their loss of [[Jerusalem]] was evidence of their having been abandoned by [[God]]. Ultimately Vladimir settled on [[Christianity]]. In the churches of the Germans his emissaries saw no beauty; but at [[Hagia Sophia]], where the full festival ritual of the Byzantine Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: ''""We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth,""'' they reported, ''""nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it.""'' If Vladimir was impressed by this account of his envoys, he was yet more so by political gains of the Byzantine alliance.

-The account of Vladimir's baptism in the Primary Chronicle is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to obtain the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir negotiated for the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Greek princess. Returning to Kiev in triumph, he destroyed pagan monuments and established many churches, starting with the splendid [[Church of the Tithes]] (989).

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. Although Vladimir seems to have gone further than both Scandinavian [[konung]]s (even human sacrifices were reported in Kiev), his religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Greek princess.

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. Although Vladimir seems to have gone further than both Scandinavian [[konung]]s (even human sacrifices were reported in Kiev), his religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Greek princess.

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus, their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the [[Primary Chronicle]] were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by [[944]]. In the [[Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kievan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time.

 Svyatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of ''Russia'', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Russian Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Of the [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]] the envoys reported there is no gladness among them; only sorrow and a great stench, and that their religion was undesirable due to its [[taboo]] against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus'.""

 The most authoritative source for the early Christianization of Rus is an encyclical letter of [[Patriarch Photius]], datable to early [[867]]. Referencing the [[Siege of Constantinople (860)|Siege of Constantinople of 860]], Photius informs the Oriental patriarchs and bishops that, after the [[Bulgars]] [[Christianization of Bulgaria |turned to Christ]] in 863 <ref> History of the Bulgarians from Antiquity to the 16th Century by Georgi Bakalov (2003) ISBN 954-528-289-4</ref>, the Rus' followed suit. As was the case with the Bulgars, the Patriarch found it prudent to send to the barbarians a [[bishop]] from Constantinople.<ref>Photii Patriarchae Constantinopolitani Epistulae et Amphilochia. Eds.: B. Laourdas, L.G. Westerinck. T.1. Leipzig, 1983. P. 49.</ref> With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[John Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Orthodox sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the [[990s]].","+ template Eastern Christianity - if you don't feel it fits well, you're welcome to remove it",Laveol,2008-05-04T13:37:31Z,"Added template ""{{Eastern Christianity}}"".

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus, their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the [[Primary Chronicle]] were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by [[944]]. In the [[Russo-Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kievan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time. 
 
-Either in [[945]] or [[957]], the ruling regent, [[Olga of Kiev]], visited [[Constantinople]] with a certain priest, Gregory. Her reception at the imperial court is described in ''[[De Ceremoniis]]''. Although it is usually presumed that she was baptized in Constantinople rather than Kiev, there is no explicit mention of the sacrament, so neither version is excluded. Olga is also known to have requested a bishop and priests from Rome.<ref>[[Thietmar of Merseburg]] says that the first archbishop of [[Magdeburg]], [[Adalbert of Prague]], before being promoted to this high rank, was sent by Emperor Otto to the country of the Rus (''Rusciae'') as a simple bishop but was expelled by pagans. The same data is duplicated in the annals of [[Quedlinburg]] and [[Hildesheim]], among others.</ref> Her son Sviatoslav (r. 963-972) continued to worship [[Perun]] and other gods of the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pantheon]]. He remained a stubborn [[Paganism|pagan]] all of his life; according to the Primary Chronicle, he believed that his warriors would lose respect for him and mock him if he became a Christian.

 Svyatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of ''Russia'', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Russian Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. Although Vladimir seems to have gone further than both Scandinavian [[konung]]s (even human sacrifices were reported in Kiev), his religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.

 At first Vladimir baptised his 12 sons and many [[boyar]]s. He destroyed the wooden statues of [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan gods]] (which he had himself raised just eight years earlier).  They were either burnt or hacked into pieces, and the statue of Perun &mdash; the supreme god &mdash; was thrown into the Dnieper. Then he sent a message to all residents of Kiev, ""rich, and poor, and beggars, and slaves"", to come to the river on the following day, lest they risk becoming the ""prince's enemies"". Large number of people came; some even brought infants with them. They were sent into the water while Orthodox priests, who came from Chersonesos for the occasion, prayed.
 
-To commemorate the event, Vladimir built the first stone [[church]] of Kievan Rus', called the [[Church of the Tithes]], where his body and the body of his new wife were to repose. Another church was built on top of the hill where pagan statues stood before.

 The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country.

Her reception at the imperial court is described in ''[[De Ceremoniis]]''.

 Svyatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of ''Russia'', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Russian Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. Although Vladimir seems to have gone further than both Scandinavian [[konung]]s (even human sacrifices were reported in Kiev), his religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.
 
 The [[Primary Chronicle]] reports that in the year [[987]], as the result of a consultation with his [[boyar]]s, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Of the [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]] the envoys reported there is no gladness among them; only sorrow and a great stench, and that their religion was undesirable due to its [[taboo]] against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus'.""

 Foreign sources, very few in number, present the following story of Vladimir's conversion.

In 987, the generals [[Bardas Sclerus]] and [[Bardas Phocas]] revolted against the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]]. Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On [[September 14]], 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Orthodox Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Greek princess.

 Returning to Kiev in triumph, Vladimir exhorted the residents of his capital to the [[Dnieper]] river for [[baptism]]. This mass baptism became the [[icon]]ic inaugural event in the Christianization of the state of [[Kievan Rus']]. 
 
 At first Vladimir baptised his 12 sons and many [[boyar]]s. He destroyed the wooden statues of [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan gods]] (which he had himself raised just eight years earlier).

 The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country. The [[Ioakim Chronicle]] says that Vladimir's uncle, [[Dobrynya]], forced the [[Novgorod]]ians into Christianity ""by fire"", while the local mayor, [[Putyata]], persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith ""by the sword"". At that same time, Bishop [[Ioakim Korsunianin]] built the first, wooden, [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|Cathedral of Holy Wisdom]] ""with 13 tops"" on the site of a pagan cemetery.  Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion. 
 
 The Christianisation of Kievan Rus' firmly allied it with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Greek learning and book culture was adopted in Kiev and other centres of the country. Churches started to be built on the Byzantine model. During the reign of Vladimir's son [[Yaroslav I]], Metropolitan [[Hilarion of Kiev|Ilarion]] authored the first known work of East Slavic literature, an elaborate oration in which he favourably compared Rus to other lands. The [[Ostromir Gospels]], produced during the same period, was the first dated East Slavic book. But the only surviving work of lay literature, ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'', testifies to the survival of pagan worldview under this Christian facade.
 
 In [[1988]], the faithful of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches which have roots in the baptism of Kiev celebrated a millennium of Eastern Slavic Christianity. The great celebrations in [[Moscow]] changed the character of relationship between the Soviet state and the church. For the first time since 1917, numerous churches and monasteries were returned to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. In Ukrainian communities around the world, members of various [[History of Christianity in Ukraine |Ukrainian churches]] also celebrated the Millennium of Christianity in [[Ukraine]].

 Svyatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of ''Russia'', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Russian Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. Although Vladimir seems to have gone further than both Scandinavian [[konung]]s (even human sacrifices were reported in Kiev), his religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.
 
-The [[Primary Chronicle]] reports that in the year [[987]], as the result of a consultation with his [[boyar]]s, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote.

-The Christianisation of Kievan Rus' firmly allied it with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Greek learning and book culture was adopted in Kiev and other centres of the country. Churches started to be built on the Byzantine model. During the reign of Vladimir's son [[Yaroslav I]], Metropolitan [[Hilarion of Kiev|Ilarion]] authored the first known work of East Slavic literature, an elaborate oration in which he favourably compared Rus to other lands. The [[Ostromir Gospels]], produced in Novgorod during the same period, was the first dated East Slavic book. But the only surviving work of lay literature, ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'', testifies to the survival of pagan worldview under this Christian facade.

 In 1988, the faithful of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches which have roots in the baptism of Kiev celebrated a millennium of Eastern Slavic Christianity. The great celebrations in [[Moscow]] changed the character of relationship between the Soviet state and the church. For the first time since 1917, numerous churches and monasteries were returned to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. In Ukrainian communities around the world, members of various [[History of Christianity in Ukraine |Ukrainian churches]] also celebrated the Millennium of Christianity in [[Ukraine]].

In 987, the generals [[Bardas Sclerus]] and [[Bardas Phocas]] revolted against the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]]. Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On [[September 14]], 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Orthodox Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

-In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Greek princess.

 Returning to Kiev in triumph, Vladimir exhorted the residents of his capital to the [[Dnieper]] river for [[baptism]]. This mass baptism became the [[icon]]ic inaugural event in the Christianization of the state of [[Kievan Rus']]. 
 
-At first Vladimir baptised his 12 sons and many [[boyar]]s. He destroyed the wooden statues of [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan gods]] (which he had himself raised just eight years earlier).  They were either burnt or hacked into pieces, and the statue of Perun &mdash; the supreme god &mdash; was thrown into the Dnieper. Then he sent a message to all residents of Kiev, ""rich, and poor, and beggars, and slaves"", to come to the river on the following day, lest they risk becoming the ""prince's enemies"". Large number of people came; some even brought infants with them.

 Svyatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus, where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Russian Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Foreign sources, very few in number, present the following story of Volodymyr's conversion. [[Yahya of Antioch]] and his followers ([[al-Rudhrawari]], [[al-Makin]], [[al-Dimashki]], and [[ibn al-Athir]])<ref>Ibn al-Athir dates these events to 985 or 986.</ref> give essentially the same account. In 987, the generals [[Bardas Sclerus]] and [[Bardas Phocas]] revolted against the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]]. Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On [[September 14]], 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Volodymyr agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Orthodox Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

-In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Volodymyr's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Volodymyr captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Volodymyr was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Greek princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in ''Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisei'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref>

They were either burnt or hacked into pieces, and the statue of Perun &mdash; the supreme god &mdash; was thrown into the Dnieper.

 The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country. The [[Ioakim Chronicle]] says that Vladimir's uncle, [[Dobrynya]], forced the [[Novgorod]]ians into Christianity ""by fire"", while the local mayor, [[Putyata]], persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith ""by the sword"".

The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslaich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an ax.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.
 
-The [[Primary Chronicle]] reports that in the year 987, as the result of a consultation with his [[boyar]]s, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Of the [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]] the envoys reported there is no gladness among them; only sorrow and a great stench, and that their religion was undesirable due to its [[taboo]] against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus'.""

 Russian sources also describe Vladimir consulting with [[Jewish]] envoys (who may or may not have been [[Khazars]]), and questioning them about their religion but ultimately rejecting it, saying that their loss of [[Jerusalem]] was evidence of their having been abandoned by [[God]]. 
 
-Ultimately Vladimir settled on [[Christianity]]. In the gloomy churches of the Germans his emissaries saw no beauty; but at [[Hagia Sophia]], where the full festival ritual of the Byzantine Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: ''""We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth,""'' they reported, ''""nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it.""'' If Vladimir was impressed by this account of his envoys, he was yet more so by political gains of the Byzantine alliance.

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus, their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the [[Primary Chronicle]] were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by 944. In the [[Russo-Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kievan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time.

 The Christianisation of Kievan Rus' firmly allied it with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Greek learning and book culture was adopted in Kiev and other centres of the country. Churches started to be built on the Byzantine model. During the reign of Vladimir's son [[Yaroslav I]], Metropolitan [[Hilarion of Kiev|Ilarion]] authored the first known work of East Slavic literature, an elaborate oration in which he favourably compared Rus to other lands known as ""the Sermon on Law and Grace"". The [[Ostromir Gospels]], produced in Novgorod during the same period, was the first dated East Slavic book. But the only surviving work of lay literature, ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'', testifies to the survival of pagan worldview under this Christian facade.
 
-In 1988, the faithful of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches which have roots in the baptism of Kiev celebrated a millennium of Eastern Slavic Christianity. The great celebrations in [[Moscow]] changed the character of relationship between the Soviet state and the church.

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus, their effect was not lasting.

In the [[Russo-Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles]] after the pagan custom.

-During the first decade of Volodymyr's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. Although Volodymyr seems to have gone further than both Scandinavian [[konung]]s (even human sacrifices were reported in Kiev), his religious reform failed.

-The [[Primary Chronicle]] reports that in the year 987, as the result of a consultation with his [[boyar]]s, Volodymyr sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Of the [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]] the envoys reported there is no gladness among them; only sorrow and a great stench, and that their religion was undesirable due to its [[taboo]] against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Volodymyr said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus'.""

 Russian sources also describe Vladimir consulting with [[Jewish]] envoys (who may or may not have been [[Khazars]]), and questioning them about their religion but ultimately rejecting it, saying that their loss of [[Jerusalem]] was evidence of their having been abandoned by [[God]]. 
 
-Ultimately Volodymyr settled on [[Christianity]]. In the gloomy churches of the Germans his emissaries saw no beauty; but at [[Hagia Sophia]], where the full festival ritual of the Byzantine Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: ''""We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth,""'' they reported, ''""nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it.""'' If Volodymyr was impressed by this account of his envoys, he was yet more so by political gains of the Byzantine alliance.

-In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Volodymyr's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Volodymyr captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Volodymyr was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law.

They were either burnt or hacked into pieces, and the statue of Perun &mdash; the supreme god &mdash; was thrown into the Dnieper.

 The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country.

-The [[Primary Chronicle]] reports that in the year 987, as the result of a consultation with his [[boyar]]s, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Of the [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]] the envoys reported there is no gladness among them; only sorrow and a great stench, and that their religion was undesirable due to its [[taboo]] against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus'.""

 Russian sources also describe Vladimir consulting with [[Jewish]] envoys (who may or may not have been [[Khazars]]), and questioning them about their religion but ultimately rejecting it, saying that their loss of [[Jerusalem]] was evidence of their having been abandoned by [[God]]. 
 
-Ultimately Vladimir settled on [[Christianity]]. In the gloomy churches of the Germans his emissaries saw no beauty; but at [[Hagia Sophia]], where the full festival ritual of the Byzantine Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: ''""We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth,""'' they reported, ''""nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it.""'' If Vladimir was impressed by this account of his envoys, he was yet more so by political gains of the Byzantine alliance.

Then he sent a message to all residents of Kiev, ""rich, and poor, and beggars, and slaves"", to come to the river on the following day, lest they risk becoming the ""prince's enemies"".

 == Aftermath ==
 The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country. The [[Ioakim Chronicle]] says that Vladimir's uncle, [[Dobrynya]], forced the [[Novgorod]]ians into Christianity ""by fire"", while the local mayor, [[Putyata]], persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith ""by the sword"". At that same time, Bishop [[Ioakim Korsunianin]] built the first, wooden, [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|Cathedral of Holy Wisdom]] ""with 13 tops"" on the site of a pagan cemetery.<ref>''Novgorodskaia tretiaia letopis'', (PSRL 3), 208.

The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslaich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an ax.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 Svyatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus, where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Russian Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Either in 945 or 957, the ruling regent, [[Olga of Kiev]], visited [[Constantinople]] with a certain priest, Gregory. Her reception at the imperial court is described in ''[[De Ceremoniis]]''. Although it is usually presumed that she was baptized in Constantinople rather than Kiev, there is no explicit mention of the sacrament, so neither version is excluded. Olga is also known to have requested a bishop and priests from Rome.<ref>[[Thietmar of Merseburg]] says that the first [[archbishop of Magdeburg]], [[Adalbert of Prague]], before being promoted to this high rank, was sent by Emperor Otto to the country of the Rus (''Rusciae'') as a simple bishop but was expelled by pagans. The same data is duplicated in the annals of [[Quedlinburg]] and [[Hildesheim]], among others.</ref> Her son, Sviatoslav (r. 963-972), continued to worship [[Perun]] and other gods of the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pantheon]]. He remained a stubborn [[Paganism|pagan]] all of his life; according to the Primary Chronicle, he believed that his warriors would lose respect for him and mock him if he became a Christian.

 The Christianisation of Kievan Rus' firmly allied it with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Greek learning and book culture was adopted in Kiev and other centres of the country. Churches started to be built on the Byzantine model. During the reign of Vladimir's son [[Yaroslav I]], Metropolitan [[Hilarion of Kiev|Ilarion]] authored the first known work of East Slavic literature, an elaborate oration in which he favourably compared Rus to other lands known as ""the Sermon on Law and Grace"". The [[Ostromir Gospels]], produced in Novgorod during the same period, was the first dated East Slavic book. But the only surviving work of lay literature, ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'', testifies to the survival of pagan worldview under this Christian facade.

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. Although Vladimir seems to have gone further than both Scandinavian [[konung]]s (even human sacrifices were reported in Kiev), his religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.
 
 The [[Primary Chronicle]] reports that in the year 987, as the result of a consultation with his [[boyar]]s, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Of the [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]] the envoys reported there is no gladness among them; only sorrow and a great stench. They also said that their religion was undesirable due to its [[taboo]] against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}<!--Not in the versions of the Primary Chronicle that I've seen-->; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus'.""{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}<!--Not in the versions of the Primary Chronicle that I've seen-->",/* Background */ [[‎Kyiv]] → [[Kiev]] (to [[WP:NC|reflect common English usage]] & for [[WP:NCGN|consistency]] within this article and with the one on [[Kiev]].,Ev,2010-03-09T15:43:40Z,"Changed the spelling of ""Kyiv"" to ""Kiev"" for consistency with common English usage.

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law.

 The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country.

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus, their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the [[Primary Chronicle]] were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by 944. In the [[Russo-Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kievan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time.

 Svyatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus, where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Russian Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 In 1988, the faithful of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches which have roots in the baptism of Kiev celebrated a millennium of Eastern Slavic Christianity. The great celebrations in [[Moscow]] changed the character of relationship between the Soviet state and the church. For the first time since 1917, numerous churches and monasteries were returned to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. In Ukrainian communities around the world, members of various [[History of Christianity in Ukraine|Ukrainian churches]] also celebrated the Millennium of Christianity in [[Ukraine]].

 Either in 945 or 957, the ruling regent, [[Olga of Kiev]], visited [[Constantinople]] with a certain priest, Gregory. Her reception at the imperial court is described in ''[[De Ceremoniis]]''. Although it is usually presumed that she was baptized in Constantinople rather than Kiev, there is no explicit mention of the sacrament, so neither version is excluded. Olga is also known to have requested a bishop and priests from Rome.<ref>[[Thietmar of Merseburg]] says that the first [[archbishop of Magdeburg]], [[Adalbert of Prague]], before being promoted to this high rank, was sent by Emperor Otto to the country of the Rus (''Rusciae'') as a simple bishop but was expelled by pagans. The same data is duplicated in the annals of [[Quedlinburg]] and [[Hildesheim]], among others.</ref> Her son, Sviatoslav (r. 963-972), continued to worship [[Perun]] and other gods of the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pantheon]]. He remained a stubborn [[Paganism|pagan]] all of his life; according to the Primary Chronicle, he believed that his warriors would lose respect for him and mock him if he became a Christian. 
 
-Svyatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus, where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Russian Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Greek princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in ''Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisei'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref>

 The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country. The [[Ioakim Chronicle]] says that Vladimir's uncle, [[Dobrynya]], forced the [[Novgorod]]ians into Christianity ""by fire"", while the local mayor, [[Putyata]], persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith ""by the sword"". At that same time, Bishop [[Ioakim Korsunianin]] built the first, wooden, [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|Cathedral of Holy Wisdom]] ""with 13 tops"" on the site of a pagan cemetery.<ref>''Novgorodskaia tretiaia letopis'', (PSRL 3), 208.

(Moscow and Leningrad: AN SSSR, 1962), vol. 1, pp. 112-113.</ref>   Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslaich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 The Christianisation of Kievan Rus' firmly allied it with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Greek learning and book culture was adopted in Kiev and other centres of the country. Churches started to be built on the Byzantine model. During the reign of Vladimir's son [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav I]], Metropolitan [[Hilarion of Kiev|Ilarion]] authored the first known work of East Slavic literature, an elaborate oration in which he favourably compared Rus to other lands known as ""the Sermon on Law and Grace"". The [[Ostromir Gospels]], produced in Novgorod during the same period, was the first dated East Slavic book. But the only surviving work of lay literature, ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'', testifies to the survival of pagan worldview under this Christian facade.

 Svyatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus, where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Russian Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

In 987, the generals [[Bardas Sclerus]] and [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phocas]] revolted against the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]]. Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Orthodox Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus, their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the [[Primary Chronicle]] were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by 944. In the [[Russo-Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kievan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time. 
 
 Either in 945 or 957, the ruling regent, [[Olga of Kiev]], visited [[Constantinople]] with a certain priest, Gregory. Her reception at the imperial court is described in ''[[De Ceremoniis]]''.

 The Christianisation of Kievan Rus' firmly allied it with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Greek learning and book culture was adopted in Kiev and other centres of the country. Churches started to be built on the Byzantine model.

 The '''[[Christianization]] of [[Kievan Rus']]'''<ref>In Russian-language (as well as Ukrainian) literature, the term ""baptism of Rus'"" ({{lang-ru|Крещение Руси}}) is often used, primarily to designate the events of 988.</ref> took place in several stages. In early 867, [[Patriarch Photius]] of Constantinople announced to other Orthodox patriarchs that the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']], baptised by his bishop, took to Christianity with particular enthusiasm. Photius's attempts at Christianizing the country seem to have entailed no lasting consequences, since the [[Primary Chronicle]] and other Slavonic sources describe the tenth-century Rus' as firmly entrenched in paganism. The definitive Christianisation of [[Kiev]] dates from the late 980s (the year is disputed<ref>See Oleg M. Rapov, ''Russkaya tserkov v IX&ndash;pervoy treti XII veka'' (''The Russian Church from the 9th to the First 3rd of the 12th Century'').

+According to the legends, [[Christianity]] was first brought to the territory of modern [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] by [[Saint Andrew]], the first [[Apostle]] of [[Jesus Christ]]. He traveled over the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Greek colony]] of [[Chersonesus Taurica]] in [[Crimea]], where he turned several thousands men to new faith. Allegedly Saint Andrew traveled also north along the [[Dnieper River]], where [[Kiev]] was founded around the 5th century, and as far north as the future location of [[Veliky Novgorod]]. The legendary account of the Russian [[Primary Chronicle]] tells that Saint Andrew was amused by the Slavic customs of washing in hot steam bath, [[banya]], on his way.
+
+[[North Pontic Greek colonies]], both in [[Crimea]] and on the modern Russian shores of the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Black Sea]], remained the main centers of Christianity in [[Eastern Europe]] for almost a thousand years. Notable Christian locations there include the [[Inkerman Cave Monastery]], a medieval [[Byzantine]] monastery where the relics of [[Pope Clement I|St. Clement]], the fourth [[Bishop of Rome]], were supposedly kept before their removal to [[San Clemente, Rome|San Clemente]] by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]].
+
+Saints Cyril and Methodius were the [[missionaries]] of Christianity among the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Great Moravia]] and [[Pannonia]]. Through their work they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title ''""Apostles to the Slavs""''. They are credited with devising the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], the first alphabet used to transcribe [[Old Church Slavonic]],<ref>Liturgy of the Hours, Volume III, 14 February.</ref> as well as [[Cyrillic alphabet]] used now in many Slavic countries, including Russia. After their deaths, their pupils continued their missionary work among other Slavs. Both brothers are venerated in the [[Orthodox Church]] as [[saint]]s with the title of ''""[[equal-to-apostles]]""''.

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. Although Vladimir seems to have gone further than both Scandinavian [[konung]]s (even human sacrifices were reported in Kiev), his religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.
 
 The [[Primary Chronicle]] reports that, in the year 986, Vladimir met with representatives from several religions. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Upon the meeting with [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]], Vladimir found their religion unsuitable due to its requirement to [[circumcise]] and [[taboo]]s against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus', we can't go without it."" He also consulted with [[Jewish]] envoys (who may or may not have been [[Khazars]]), questioned them about their religion but ultimately rejected it, saying that their loss of [[Jerusalem]] was evidence of their having been abandoned by [[God]].<ref>Primary Chronicle, year 6494 (986)</ref>

Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Orthodox Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Greek princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in ''Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisei'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref>

 The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country. The [[Ioakim Chronicle]] says that Vladimir's uncle, [[Dobrynya]], forced the [[Novgorod]]ians into Christianity ""by fire"", while the local mayor, [[Putyata]], persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith ""by the sword"". At that same time, Bishop [[Ioakim Korsunianin]] built the first, wooden, [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|Cathedral of Holy Wisdom]] ""with 13 tops"" on the site of a pagan cemetery.<ref>''Novgorodskaia tretiaia letopis'', (PSRL 3), 208.

 The Christianisation of Kievan Rus' firmly allied it with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Greek learning and book culture was adopted in Kiev and other centres of the country. Churches started to be built on the Byzantine model. During the reign of Vladimir's son [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav I]], Metropolitan [[Hilarion of Kiev|Ilarion]] authored the first known work of East Slavic literature, an elaborate oration in which he favourably compared Rus to other lands known as ""the Sermon on Law and Grace"". The [[Ostromir Gospels]], produced in Novgorod during the same period, was the first dated East Slavic book. But the only surviving work of lay literature, ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'', testifies to the survival of pagan worldview under this Christian facade.

The great celebrations in [[Moscow]] changed the character of relationship between the Soviet state and the church.

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus', their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the [[Primary Chronicle]] were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by 944. In the [[Russo-Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus' swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kievan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time.

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. Although Vladimir seems to have gone further than both Scandinavian [[konung]]s (even human sacrifices were reported in Kiev), his religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.
 
 The [[Primary Chronicle]] reports that, in the year 986, Vladimir met with representatives from several religions. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Upon the meeting with [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]], Vladimir found their religion unsuitable due to its requirement to [[circumcise]] and [[taboo]]s against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus', we can't go without it."" He also consulted with [[Jewish]] envoys (who may or may not have been [[Khazars]]), questioned them about their religion but ultimately rejected it, saying that their loss of [[Jerusalem]] was evidence of their having been abandoned by [[God]].<ref>Primary Chronicle, year 6494 (986)</ref> ",/* Background */ add pic,Greyhood,2011-09-15T15:17:53Z,"Changed the text to include an additional image and a more explicit reference to ""Vladimir the Great"" in the description.

According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically.

In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]].

The great celebrations in [[Moscow]] changed the character of relationship between the Soviet state and the church.

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. Although Vladimir seems to have gone further than both Scandinavian [[konung]]s (even human sacrifices were reported in Kiev), his religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.
 
 The [[Primary Chronicle]] reports that, in the year 986, Vladimir met with representatives from several religions. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Upon the meeting with [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]], Vladimir found their religion unsuitable due to its requirement to [[circumcise]] and [[taboo]]s against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus', we can't go without it."" He also consulted with [[Jewish]] envoys (who may or may not have been [[Khazars]]), questioned them about their religion but ultimately rejected it, saying that their loss of [[Jerusalem]] was evidence of their having been abandoned by [[God]].<ref>Primary Chronicle, year 6494 (986)</ref>

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Greek princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in ''Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisei'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref>

 Returning to Kiev in triumph, Vladimir exhorted the residents of his capital to the [[Dnieper]] river for [[baptism]]. This mass baptism became the [[icon]]ic inaugural event in the Christianization of the state of [[Kievan Rus']]. 
 
 At first Vladimir baptised his 12 sons and many [[boyar]]s. He destroyed the wooden statues of [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan gods]] (which he had himself raised just eight years earlier).  They were either burnt or hacked into pieces, and the statue of Perun &mdash; the supreme god &mdash; was thrown into the Dnieper. Then he sent a message to all residents of Kiev, ""rich, and poor, and beggars, and slaves"", to come to the river on the following day, lest they risk becoming the ""prince's enemies"".

Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Orthodox Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith.

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus', their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the [[Primary Chronicle]] were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by 944. In the [[Russo-Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus' swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kievan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time.

In the [[Russo-Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus' swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]] after the pagan custom.

When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

-In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]].

 [[File:Vladimir2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] discuss [[Christianity]] with a Greek philosopher.]]
 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. Although Vladimir seems to have gone further than both Scandinavian [[konung]]s (even human sacrifices were reported in Kiev), his religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.
 
-The [[Primary Chronicle]] reports that, in the year 986, Vladimir met with representatives from several religions. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Upon the meeting with [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]], Vladimir found their religion unsuitable due to its requirement to [[circumcise]] and [[taboo]]s against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus', we can't go without it."" He also consulted with [[Jewish]] envoys (who may or may not have been [[Khazars]]), questioned them about their religion but ultimately rejected it, saying that their loss of [[Jerusalem]] was evidence of their having been abandoned by [[God]].<ref>Primary Chronicle, year 6494 (986)</ref>

 In the year 987, as the result of a consultation with his [[boyar]]s, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. Of the [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]] the envoys reported there is no joy among them; only sorrow and a great stench. In the gloomy churches of the Germans his emissaries saw no beauty; but at [[Hagia Sophia]], where the full festival ritual of the Byzantine Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: ''""We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth,""'' they reported, ''""nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it.""''<ref>Primary Chronicle, year 6495 (987)</ref>

The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[John Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Orthodox sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the 990s.

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus', their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the [[Primary Chronicle]] were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by 944. In the [[Russo-Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus' swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kievan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time.

Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Orthodox Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[John Zonaras]].

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus', their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the [[Primary Chronicle]] were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by 944. In the [[Russo-Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus' swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kievan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time.

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. His religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.
 
 The [[Primary Chronicle]] reports that, in the year 986, Vladimir met with representatives from several religions. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Upon the meeting with [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]], Vladimir found their religion unsuitable due to its requirement to [[circumcise]] and [[taboo]]s against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus', we can't go without it."" He also consulted with [[Jewish]] envoys (who may or may not have been [[Khazars]]), questioned them about their religion but ultimately rejected it, saying that their loss of [[Jerusalem]] was evidence of their having been abandoned by [[God]].<ref>Primary Chronicle, year 6494 (986)</ref>

 In the year 987, as the result of a consultation with his [[boyar]]s, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths.

In the gloomy churches of the Germans his emissaries saw no beauty; but at [[Hagia Sophia]], where the full festival ritual of the Byzantine Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: ''""We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth,""'' they reported, ''""nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it.""''<ref>Primary Chronicle, year 6495 (987)</ref>

Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Orthodox Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

-In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas.

 Either in 945 or 957, the ruling regent, [[Olga of Kiev]], visited [[Constantinople]] with a certain priest, Gregory. Her reception at the imperial court is described in ''[[De Ceremoniis]]''. According to legends, [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII]] fell in love with Olga; however, she found a way to refuse him by tricking him to become her [[godparent|godfather]]. When she was baptized, she said it was inappropriate for a godfather to marry his [[goddaughter]].

The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

-The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country. The [[Ioakim Chronicle]] says that Vladimir's uncle, [[Dobrynya]], forced the [[Novgorod]]ians into Christianity ""by fire"", while the local mayor, [[Putyata]], persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith ""by the sword"".

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. His religious reform failed.

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Greek princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in '' [[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles|Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisey]]'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref> The alleged place of Vladimir's baptism in Chersonesos is marked by [[Chersonesus Cathedral|St. Vladimir's Cathedral]].

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Orthodox sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII.

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Orthodox sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the 990s.

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. His religious reform failed.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

**Conclusion**: Weaponised",Weaponised
"The ''baptism of Kyiv'' occured in 988, when the Prince of Rus', [[Vladimir I]], exhorted the residents of the capital city of Rus', Kyiv, to the Dnipr River for baptism. This mass baptism became the iconic inaugural event in the Christianization of the state of Kievan Rus'. This baptism made Eastern Christianity the state religion of Rus', and marked the beginning of the Ukrainian apostolic churches, Greek Catholic/Greek Orthodox, and eventually led to the Christianization of Belarus' and Russia.","---

He traveled over the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Greek colony]] of [[Chersonesus Taurica]] in [[Crimea]], where he converted several thousand men to new faith.

 [[North Pontic Greek colonies]], both in [[Crimea]] and on the modern Ukrainian shores of the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Black Sea]], remained the main centers of Christianity in [[Eastern Europe]] for almost a thousand years.

 Saints Cyril and Methodius were the [[missionaries]] of Christianity among the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Great Moravia]] and [[Pannonia]]. Through their work they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title ''""Apostles to the Slavs""''.

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Orthodox sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the 990s.

-During the first decade of Volodymyr's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. His religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.

+Foreign sources, very few in number, present the following story of Vladimir's conversion. [[Yahya of Antioch]] and his followers ([[al-Rudhrawari]], [[al-Makin]], [[Shams al-Din al-Ansari al-Dimashqi|Al-Dimashqi]], and [[ibn al-Athir]])<ref>Ibn al-Athir dates these events to 985 or 986.</ref> give essentially the same account. In 987, the generals [[Bardas Sclerus]] and [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phocas]] revolted against the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]]. Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Orthodox Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

-In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Volodymyr's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Volodymyr captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Volodymyr was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kyiv), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Greek princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in '' [[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles|Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisey]]'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref> The alleged place of Vladimir's baptism in Chersonesos is marked by [[Chersonesus Cathedral|St. Volodymyr's Cathedral]].

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

They are credited with devising the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], the first alphabet used to transcribe [[Old Church Slavonic]],<ref>Liturgy of the Hours, Volume III, 14 February.</ref> Later on their students created the [[Cyrillic script]] in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] used now in many Slavic countries, including Ukraine.

-During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in.

This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. His religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. His religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.
 
-The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' reports that, in the year 986, Vladimir met with representatives from several religions. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Upon the meeting with [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]], Vladimir found their religion unsuitable due to its requirement to [[circumcise]] and [[taboo]]s against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus.""

 Saints Cyril and Methodius were the [[missionaries]] of Christianity among the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Great Moravia]] and [[Pannonia]].

That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Orthodox sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII.

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.

 Saints Cyril and Methodius were the [[missionaries]] of Christianity among the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Great Moravia]] and [[Pannonia]].

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Orthodox sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII.

According to legends, [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII]] fell in love with Olga; however, she found a way to refuse him by tricking him to become her [[godparent|godfather]]. When she was baptized, she said it was inappropriate for a godfather to marry his [[goddaughter]].
 
-Although it is usually presumed that Olga was baptized in Constantinople rather than Kiev, there is no explicit mention of the sacrament, so neither version is excluded. Olga is also known to have requested a bishop and priests from Rome.<ref>[[Thietmar of Merseburg]] says that the first [[archbishop of Magdeburg]], [[Adalbert of Prague]], before being promoted to this high rank, was sent by Emperor Otto to the country of the Rus (''Rusciae'') as a simple bishop but was expelled by pagans. The same data is duplicated in the annals of [[Quedlinburg]] and [[Hildesheim]], among others.</ref> Her son, [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]] (r. 963-972), continued to worship [[Perun]] and other gods of the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pantheon]]. He remained a stubborn [[Paganism|pagan]] all of his life; according to the Primary Chronicle, he believed that his warriors would lose respect for him and mock him if he became a Christian.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 At first Vladimir baptised his 12 sons and many [[boyar]]s. He destroyed the wooden statues of [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan gods]] (which he had himself raised just eight years earlier).  They were either burnt or hacked into pieces, and the statue of Perun &mdash; the supreme god &mdash; was thrown into the Dnieper.<ref>{{cite book|last=Longsworth|first=Philip|date=2006|title=Russia: The Once and Future Empire from Pre-History to Putin|page=38 |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-36041-X }}<!--|accessdate=17 Jan 2014--></ref>

-The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country. The [[Ioakim Chronicle]] says that Vladimir's uncle, [[Dobrynya]], forced the [[Novgorod]]ians into Christianity ""by fire"", while the local mayor, [[Putyata]], persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith ""by the sword"".

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 Saints Cyril and Methodius were the [[missionaries]] of Christianity among the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Great Moravia]] and [[Pannonia]].

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Orthodox sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII.

The same data is duplicated in the annals of [[Quedlinburg]] and [[Hildesheim]], among others.</ref> Her son, [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]] (r. 963-972), continued to worship [[Perun]] and other gods of the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pantheon]]. He remained a stubborn [[Paganism|pagan]] all of his life; according to the Primary Chronicle, he believed that his warriors would lose respect for him and mock him if he became a Christian.
 
 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

In 987, the generals [[Bardas Sclerus]] and [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phocas]] revolted against the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]]. Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Orthodox Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

-In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]].

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 [[North Pontic Greek colonies]], both in [[Crimea]] and on the modern Ukrainian shores of the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Black Sea]], remained the main centers of Christianity in [[Eastern Europe]] for almost a thousand years.

 Saints Cyril and Methodius were the [[missionaries]] of Christianity among the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Great Moravia]] and [[Pannonia]]. Through their work they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title ''""Apostles to the Slavs""''. They are credited with devising the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], the first alphabet used to transcribe [[Old Church Slavonic]],<ref>Liturgy of the Hours, Volume III, 14 February.</ref> Later on their students created the [[Cyrillic script]] in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] used now in many Slavic countries, including Russia. After their deaths, their pupils continued their missionary work among other Slavs. Both brothers are venerated in the Ukrainian Catholic and Byzantine Catholic Churches as well as the Orthodox Church as [[saint]]s with the title of ''""[[equal-to-apostles]]""''.

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Byzantine princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in '' [[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles|Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisey]]'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref> The alleged place of Vladimir's baptism in Chersonesos is marked by [[Chersonesus Cathedral|St. Vladimir's Cathedral]].

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope.

[[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Byzantine princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in '' [[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles|Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisey]]'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref> The alleged place of Vladimir's baptism in Chersonesos is marked by [[Chersonesus Cathedral|St. Vladimir's Cathedral]].

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

In 987, the generals [[Bardas Sclerus]] and [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phocas]] revolted against the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]]. Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas.

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the 990s.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.

 Saints Cyril and Methodius were the [[missionaries]] of Christianity among the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Great Moravia]] and [[Pannonia]]. Through their work they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title ''""Apostles to the Slavs""''. They are credited with devising the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], the first alphabet used to transcribe [[Old Church Slavonic]],<ref>Liturgy of the Hours, Volume III, 14 February.</ref> Later on their students created the [[Cyrillic script]] in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] used now in many Slavic countries, including Russia.

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the 990s.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

He traveled over the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Greek colony]] of [[Chersonesus Taurica]] in [[Crimea]], where he converted several thousand men to the new faith.

 [[North Pontic Greek colonies]], both in [[Crimea]] and on the modern Ukrainian shores of the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Black Sea]], remained the main centers of Christianity in [[Eastern Europe]] for almost a thousand years.

 Saints Cyril and Methodius were the [[missionaries]] of Christianity among the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Great Moravia]] and [[Pannonia]]. Through their work they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title ''""Apostles to the Slavs""''. They are credited with devising the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], the first alphabet used to transcribe [[Old Church Slavonic]],<ref>Liturgy of the Hours, Volume III, 14 February.</ref> Later on their students created the [[Cyrillic script]] in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] used now in many Slavic countries, including Russia. After their deaths, their pupils continued their missionary work among other Slavs. Both brothers are venerated in the Ukrainian Catholic and Byzantine Catholic Churches as well as the Orthodox Church as [[saint]]s with the title of ''""[[equal-to-apostles]]""''.

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the 990s.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the 990s.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 At first Vladimir baptized his twelve sons and many [[boyar]]s. He destroyed the wooden statues of [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan gods]] (which he had himself raised just eight years earlier).  They were either burnt or hacked into pieces, and the statue of [[Perun]] &mdash; the supreme god &mdash; was thrown into the Dnieper.<ref>{{cite book|last=Longsworth|first=Philip|date=2006|title=Russia: The Once and Future Empire from Pre-History to Putin|page=38 |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-36041-X }}<!--|access-date=17 Jan 2014--></ref>

-The baptism of Kyiv was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country. The [[Ioakim Chronicle]] says that Vladimir's uncle, [[Dobrynya]], forced the [[Novgorod]]ians into Christianity ""by fire"", while the local mayor, [[Putyata]], persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith ""by the sword"".

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

[[Yahya of Antioch]] and his followers ([[al-Rudhrawari]], [[al-Makin]], [[Shams al-Din al-Ansari al-Dimashqi|Al-Dimashqi]], and [[ibn al-Athir]])<ref>Ibn al-Athir dates these events to 985 or 986.</ref> give essentially the same account. In 987, the generals [[Bardas Sclerus]] and [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phocas]] revolted against the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]]. Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

-In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kyiv), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Byzantine princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in '' [[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles|Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisey]]'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref> The alleged place of Vladimir's baptism in Chersonesos is marked by [[Chersonesus Cathedral|St. Vladimir's Cathedral]].

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 Saints Cyril and Methodius were the [[missionaries]] of Christianity among the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Great Moravia]] and [[Pannonia]]. Through their work they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title ''""Apostles to the Slavs""''. They are credited with devising the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], the first alphabet used to transcribe [[Old Church Slavonic]],<ref>Liturgy of the Hours, Volume III, 14 February.</ref> Later on their students created the [[Cyrillic script]] in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] used now in many Slavic countries, including Russia.

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Foreign sources, very few in number, present the following story of Vladimir's conversion. [[Yahya of Antioch]] and his followers ([[al-Rudhrawari]], [[al-Makin]], [[Shams al-Din al-Ansari al-Dimashqi|Al-Dimashqi]], and [[ibn al-Athir]])<ref>Ibn al-Athir dates these events to 985 or 986.</ref> give essentially the same account. In 987, the generals [[Bardas Sclerus]] and [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phocas]] revolted against the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]]. Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

-In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Byzantine princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in '' [[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles|Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisey]]'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref> The alleged place of Vladimir's baptism in Chersonesos is marked by [[Chersonesus Cathedral|St. Vladimir's Cathedral]].

-The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country. The [[Ioakim Chronicle]] says that Vladimir's uncle, [[Dobrynya]], forced the [[Novgorod]]ians into Christianity ""by fire"", while the local mayor, [[Putyata]], persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith ""by the sword"".

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

-The Christianization of Rus firmly allied it with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Greek learning and book culture was adopted in Kiev and other centres of the country. Churches started to be built on the Byzantine model. During the reign of Vladimir's son [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav I]], Metropolitan [[Hilarion of Kiev|Ilarion]] authored the first known work of East Slavic literature, an elaborate oration in which he favourably compared Rus to other lands known as the ""[[Sermon on Law and Grace]]""{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}.

But the only surviving work of lay literature, ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'', indicates that a degree of pagan worldview remained under Christian Kievan Rus'{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}.

"The ''baptism of Kyiv'' occured in 988, when the Prince of Rus', [[Vladimir I]], exhorted the residents of the capital city of Rus', Kyiv, to the Dnipr River for baptism.

This baptism made Eastern Christianity the state religion of Rus', and marked the beginning of the Ukrainian apostolic churches, Greek Catholic/Greek Orthodox, and eventually led to the Christianization of Belarus' and Russia.","---

He traveled over the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Greek colony]] of [[Chersonesus Taurica]] in [[Crimea]], where he converted several thousand men to the new faith.

 [[North Pontic Greek colonies]], both in [[Crimea]] and on the modern Ukrainian shores of the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Black Sea]], remained the main centers of Christianity in [[Eastern Europe]] for almost a thousand years. Notable Christian locations there include the [[Inkerman Cave Monastery]], a medieval [[Byzantine]] monastery where the relics of [[Pope Clement I|St. Clement]], the fourth [[Bishop of Rome]], were supposedly kept before their removal to [[San Clemente, Rome|San Clemente]] by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]].
 
 Saints Cyril and Methodius were the [[missionaries]] of Christianity among the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Great Moravia]] and [[Pannonia]]. Through their work they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title ''""Apostles to the Slavs""''. They are credited with devising the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], the first alphabet used to transcribe [[Old Church Slavonic]],<ref>Liturgy of the Hours, Volume III, 14 February.</ref> Later on their students created the [[Cyrillic script]] in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] used now in many Slavic countries, including Russia. After their deaths, their pupils continued their missionary work among other Slavs. Both brothers are venerated in the Ukrainian Catholic and Byzantine Catholic Churches as well as the Orthodox Church as [[saint]]s with the title of ''""[[equal-to-apostles]]""''.

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the 990s.

This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. His religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

+According to the Church Tradition, [[Christianity]] was first brought to the territory of modern [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] by [[Saint Andrew]], the first [[Apostles in the New Testament|Apostle]] of [[Jesus Christ]]. He traveled over the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Greek colony]] of [[Chersonesus Taurica]] in [[Crimea]], where he converted several thousand men to the new faith. Allegedly Saint Andrew traveled also north along the [[Dnieper River]], where [[Kyiv]] would be founded around the 5th century, and as far north as the future location of [[Veliky Novgorod]]. The legendary account of the Rus'ian [[Primary Chronicle]] tells that Saint Andrew was amused by the Slavic customs of washing in a hot steam bath, [[banya (sauna)|banya]], on his way.
 
 [[North Pontic Greek colonies]], both in [[Crimea]] and on the modern Ukrainian shores of the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Black Sea]], remained the main centers of Christianity in [[Eastern Europe]] for almost a thousand years. Notable Christian locations there include the [[Inkerman Cave Monastery]], a medieval [[Byzantine]] monastery where the relics of [[Pope Clement I|St. Clement]], the fourth [[Bishop of Rome]], were supposedly kept before their removal to [[San Clemente al Laterano]] by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]].
 
 Saints Cyril and Methodius were the [[missionaries]] of Christianity among the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Great Moravia]] and [[Pannonia]]. Through their work, they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title ''""Apostles to the Slavs""''. They are credited with devising the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], the first alphabet used to transcribe [[Old Church Slavonic]].<ref>Liturgy of the Hours, Volume III, 14 February.</ref> Later on their students created the [[Cyrillic script]] in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] used now in many Slavic countries, including Russia. After their deaths, their pupils continued their missionary work among other Slavs. Both brothers are venerated in the Ukrainian Catholic and Byzantine Catholic Churches as well as the Orthodox Church as [[saint]]s with the title of ''""[[equal-to-apostles]]""''.

 The most authoritative source for the early [[Christianization]] of Rus' is an encyclical letter of [[Photios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photius]], datable to early 867. Referencing the [[Siege of Constantinople (860)|Siege of Constantinople of 860]], Photius informs the Oriental patriarchs and bishops that, after the [[Bulgarians]] [[Christianization of Bulgaria|turned to Christ]] in 863,<ref>History of the Bulgarians from Antiquity to the 16th Century by Georgi Bakalov (2003) {{ISBN|954-528-289-4}}</ref> the Rus' followed suit.

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the 990s.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Byzantine princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in '' [[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles|Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisey]]'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref> The alleged place of Vladimir's baptism in Chersonesos is marked by [[Chersonesus Cathedral|St. Vladimir's Cathedral]].

 With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the 990s.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Byzantine princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in '' [[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles|Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisey]]'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref> The alleged place of Vladimir's baptism in Chersonesos is marked by [[Chersonesus Cathedral|St. Vladimir's Cathedral]].

The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Foreign sources, very few in number, present the following story of Vladimir's conversion. [[Yahya of Antioch]] and his followers ([[al-Rudhrawari]], [[al-Makin]], [[Shams al-Din al-Ansari al-Dimashqi|Al-Dimashqi]], and [[ibn al-Athir]])<ref>Ibn al-Athir dates these events to 985 or 986.</ref> give essentially the same account. In 987, the generals [[Bardas Sclerus]] and [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phocas]] revolted against the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]]. Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

-In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kyiv), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law.

The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.

-With some modifications, the story is repeated by [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', followed by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an argumentum ex silentio: no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus in the 990s.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope.

Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 Saints Cyril and Methodius were the [[missionaries]] of Christianity among the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Great Moravia]] and [[Pannonia]]. Through their work, they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title ''""Apostles to the Slavs""''.

This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kyiv), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Byzantine princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in '' [[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles|Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisey]]'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref> The alleged place of Vladimir's baptism in Chersonesos is marked by [[Chersonesus Cathedral|St. Vladimir's Cathedral]].

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

-Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land).

-During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. His religious reform failed. By the late 980s he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.

-The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' reports that, in the year 986, Vladimir met with representatives from several religions. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote.

-In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas.

-The baptism of Kiev was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country. The [[Ioakim Chronicle]] says that Vladimir's uncle, [[Dobrynya]], forced the [[Novgorod]]ians into Christianity ""by fire"", while the local mayor, [[Putyata]], persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith ""by the sword"".

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

-According to the Church Tradition, [[Christianity]] was first brought to the territory of modern [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] by [[Saint Andrew]], the first [[Apostles in the New Testament|Apostle]] of [[Jesus Christ]]. He traveled over the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Greek colony]] of [[Chersonesus Taurica]] in [[Crimea]], where he converted several thousand men to the new faith. Allegedly Saint Andrew traveled also north along the [[Dnieper River]], where [[Kiev|Kyiv]] would be founded around the 5th century, and as far north as the future location of [[Veliky Novgorod]]. The legendary account of the Rus'ian [[Primary Chronicle]] tells that Saint Andrew was amused by the Slavic customs of washing in a hot steam bath, [[banya (sauna)|banya]], on his way.

 [[North Pontic Greek colonies]], both in [[Crimea]] and on the modern Ukrainian shores of the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Black Sea]], remained the main centers of Christianity in [[Eastern Europe]] for almost a thousand years. Notable Christian locations there include the [[Inkerman Cave Monastery]], a medieval [[Byzantine]] monastery where the relics of [[Pope Clement I|St. Clement]], the fourth [[Bishop of Rome]], were supposedly kept before their removal to [[San Clemente al Laterano]] by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]].
 
 Saints Cyril and Methodius were the [[missionaries]] of Christianity among the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Great Moravia]] and [[Pannonia]]. Through their work, they influenced the cultural development of all Slavs, for which they received the title ''""Apostles to the Slavs""''. They are credited with devising the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], the first alphabet used to transcribe [[Old Church Slavonic]].<ref>Liturgy of the Hours, Volume III, 14 February.</ref> Later on their students created the [[Cyrillic script]] in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] used now in many Slavic countries, including Russia. After their deaths, their pupils continued their missionary work among other Slavs. Both brothers are venerated in the Ukrainian Catholic and Byzantine Catholic Churches as well as the Orthodox Church as [[saint]]s with the title of ''""[[equal-to-apostles]]""''.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Byzantine princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in '' [[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles|Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisey]]'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref> The alleged place of Vladimir's baptism in Chersonesos is marked by [[Chersonesus Cathedral|St. Vladimir's Cathedral]].

Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by 944.

The Kievan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

It is repeated by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century the Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII.

Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope.

-[[File:Eggink VelKnVladimir.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Ivan Eggink's painting represents Vladimir listening to the Orthodox priests, while the papal envoy stands aside in discontent]]
-During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. His religious reform failed. By the late 980s, he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 With some modifications, the above story is repeated by Emperor [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''. It is repeated by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century the Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an ''argumentum ex silentio'': no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus' in the 990s.

 [[File:Radzivill Olga in Konstantinopol.jpg|thumb|275px|''The baptism of [[Olga of Kiev|St. Princess Olga]] in [[Constantinople]]'', a miniature from the [[Radzivill Chronicle]]]]
 Either in 945 or 957, the ruling regent, [[Olga of Kiev]], visited [[Constantinople]] with a certain priest, Gregory. Her reception at the imperial court is described in ''[[De Ceremoniis]]''. According to legends, [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII]] fell in love with Olga; however, she found a way to refuse him by tricking him to become her [[godparent|godfather]]. When she was baptized, she said it was inappropriate for a godfather to marry his [[goddaughter]].

"The ''baptism of Kyiv'' occured in 988, when the Prince of Rus', [[Vladimir I]], exhorted the residents of the capital city of Rus', Kyiv, to the Dnipr River for baptism. This mass baptism became the iconic inaugural event in the Christianization of the state of Kievan Rus'. This baptism made Eastern Christianity the state religion of Rus', and marked the beginning of the Ukrainian apostolic churches, Greek Catholic/Greek Orthodox, and eventually led to the Christianization of Belarus' and Russia.","---

 With some modifications, the above story is repeated by Emperor [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''. It is repeated by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century the Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an ''argumentum ex silentio'': no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus' in the 990s.
 
-Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus', their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' were aware that a sizable portion of the Kyivan population was Christian by 944. In the [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus' swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kyivan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kyiv at the time.

Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972-980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

-During the first decade of Volodymyr's
+During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. His religious reform failed.

Upon the meeting with [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]], Vladimir found their religion unsuitable due to its requirement to [[circumcise]] and [[taboo]]s against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus.""

+In the year 987, as the result of a consultation with his [[boyar]]s, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. Of the [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]] the envoys reported there is no joy among them; only sorrow and a great stench. In the gloomy churches of the Germans his emissaries saw no beauty; but at [[Hagia Sophia]], where the full festival ritual of the Byzantine Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: ''""We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth,""'' they reported, ''""nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it.""''<ref>Primary Chronicle, year 6495 (987)</ref>

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in.

This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. His religious reform failed.

-With some modifications, the above story is repeated by Emperor [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''. It is repeated by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century the Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII.

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus', their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by 944. In the [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus' swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kievan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

According to legends, [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII]] fell in love with Olga; however, she found a way to refuse him by tricking him to become her [[godparent|godfather]].

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

"The ''baptism of Kyiv'' occured in 988, when the Prince of Rus', [[Vladimir I]], exhorted the residents of the capital city of Rus', Kyiv, to the Dnipr River for baptism. This mass baptism became the iconic inaugural event in the Christianization of the state of Kievan Rus'. This baptism made Eastern Christianity the state religion of Rus', and marked the beginning of the Ukrainian apostolic churches, Greek Catholic/Greek Orthodox, and eventually led to the Christianization of Belarus' and Russia.","---

 With some modifications, the above story is repeated by Emperor [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''. It is repeated by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century the Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an ''argumentum ex silentio'': no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus' in the 990s.
 
-Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus', their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' were aware that a sizable portion of the Kyivan population was Christian by 944. In the [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus' swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kyivan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kyiv at the time.

-The most authoritative source for the early [[Christianization]] of Rus' is an encyclical letter of [[Photios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photius]], datable to early 867. Referencing the [[Siege of Constantinople (860)|Siege of Constantinople of 860]], Photius informs the Oriental patriarchs and bishops that, after the [[Bulgarians]] [[Christianization of Bulgaria|turned to Christ]] in 863,<ref>History of the Bulgarians from Antiquity to the 16th Century by Georgi Bakalov (2003) {{ISBN|954-528-289-4}}</ref> the Rus' followed suit. As was the case with the Bulgarians, the Patriarch found it prudent to send to the barbarians a [[bishop]] from Constantinople.<ref>Photii Patriarchae Constantinopolitani Epistulae et Amphilochia. Eds.: B. Laourdas, L. G. Westerinck. T.1. Leipzig, 1983. P. 49.</ref>
+Some of the earliest Kyivan princes and princesses such as [[Askold and Dir]] and [[Olha of Kyiv]] reportedly converted to Christianity, but [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleh the Wise]], [[Ihor of Kyiv]] and [[Sviatoslav I|Svyatoslav]] remained pagans.{{sfn|Katchanovski|Kohut|Nesebio|Yurkevich|2013|p=74–75}} According to some sources and historians, there was an attempt in the 9th century to Christianise Kyivan Rus'. The most authoritative source for this purported first conversion attempt is an [[encyclical]] letter of [[Photios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photius]] of [[Constantinople]], datable to early 867. Referencing the [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|Rus'-Byzantine War of 860]], Photius informs the Oriental [[patriarchate|patriarchs]] and bishops that, after the [[Bulgars]] [[Christianization of Bulgaria|turned to Christ]] in 863,<ref>History of the Bulgarians from Antiquity to the 16th Century by Georgi Bakalov (2003) {{ISBN|954-528-289-4}}</ref> the Rus' followed suit so zealously that he found it prudent to send to their land a [[bishop]].<ref>Photii Patriarchae Constantinopolitani Epistulae et Amphilochia. Ed. B. Laourdas, L.G. Westerinck. T.1. Leipzig, 1983. P. 49.</ref>
+
+Byzantine historians, starting with the continuation of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], assumed that the Rus' [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|raid against Constantinople in 860]] was a Byzantine success and attributed the presumed victory to [[the Intercession]] of the [[Theotokos]]. This conviction dictated the following interpretation: awed by the miracles they witnessed under the walls of the imperial capital and grief-stricken at the disaster that befell them, the Rus' sent envoys to Photius and asked him to send a bishop to their land.<ref>Theophanes Continuatus, Ioannes Cameniata, Symeon Magister, Georgius Monachus. Ed. I. Becker. Bonnae, 1838 (CSHB), p. 196.</ref>
+
+According to [[Constantine VII]], who authored a biography of his grandfather, [[Basil the Macedonian]], it was his ancestor who persuaded the Rus' to abandon their [[paganism|pagan]] ways. Constantine attributes the conversion to Basil and to [[Ignatios of Constantinople|Patriarch Ignatius]], rather than to their predecessors, [[Michael III]] and Photius. He narrates how the Byzantines galvanized the Rus' into conversion by their persuasive words and rich presents, including gold, silver, and precious tissues. He also repeats a traditional story that the pagans were particularly impressed by a miracle: a [[gospel]] book thrown by the archbishop (sic) into an oven was not damaged by fire.<ref>heophanes Continuatus, Ioannes Cameniata, Symeon Magister, Georgius Monachus. Ed. I. Becker. Bonnae, 1838 (CSHB), pp. 342-343.</ref>
+
+Constantine's account precipitated a long-term dispute over whether the 9th-century Christianization of the Rus' went through two stages. One school of thought postulates that there was only one Christianization: wishing to glorify his ancestor, Constantine simply ascribed to Basil the missionary triumphs of his predecessor, Michael III.<ref>A. Avenarius. ''Christianity in 9th-century Rus''. // Beitruge zur byzantinischen Geschichte im 9.-11. Jahrhundert. Prague: V. Vavrinek, 1978. Pp. 301-315.</ref>
+
+On the other hand, [[Constantine Zuckerman]] argues that, in response to the initial request of the Rus', Photius (and Michael III) sent to the [[Rus' Khaganate]] a simple bishop. The pagans felt slighted at the low rank of the prelate and their Christian zeal evaporated. In September 867, Michael was assassinated by Basil, who (together with a new patriarch, Ignatius) sent to the Rus' an [[archbishop]] who propped up the religious fervor of the local leaders with rich presents. Parenthetically, the contemporaneous [[Christianization of Bulgaria]] was likewise effected in two stages: the Bulgars were offended when a simple bishop arrived to their capital from Constantinople and requested [[Pope Nicholas I]] to send them a higher-ranking church official. Such considerations were an important matter of political prestige.<ref>Zuckerman, Constantine. ''Deux etapes de la formation de l’ancien etat russe,'' dans ''Les centres proto-urbains russes entre Scandinavie, Byzance et Orient. Actes du Colloque International tenu au College de France en octobre 1997,'' ed. M. Kazanski, A. Nersessian et C. Zuckerman (Réalités byzantines 7), Paris 2000, p. 95-120.</ref> This pattern has parallels with the stories of [[Franks|Frankish]] historians about the multiple ""[[baptism]]s"" of the [[Norsemen]], whose true intention was to get hold of the rich gifts accompanying the Christianization rituals.<ref>Петрухин В.Я. Начало этнокультурной истории Руси IX-XI вв. Moscow: Gnozis, 1995. P. 220.</ref>
+
+The date and rationale for the Christianization are also shrouded in controversy. [[Grigory Litavrin]] views the event as ""a formal and diplomatic act making it easier to obtain advantageous agreements with the ruler of the Christian state.""<ref>Florja B.N., Litavrin G.G. ''Christianization of the Nations of Central and South-East Europe and the Conversion of Old Rus''. // Byzantinoslavica. 1988. 49. P. 186.</ref> Zuckerman argues that Ignatius sent his archbishop to Rus' in about 870, while [[Dmitry Obolensky]] inclines to accept 874 as the date of the definitive Christianization.<ref>D. Obolensky. ''Byzantium and the Slavs: Collected Studies''. London, 1971. V.4.</ref>

 With some modifications, the above story is repeated by Emperor [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''. It is repeated by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century the Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII.

"The ''baptism of Kyiv'' occured in 988, when the Prince of Rus', [[Vladimir I]], exhorted the residents of the capital city of Rus', Kyiv, to the Dnipr River for baptism. This mass baptism became the iconic inaugural event in the Christianization of the state of Kievan Rus'. This baptism made Eastern Christianity the state religion of Rus', and marked the beginning of the Ukrainian apostolic churches, Greek Catholic/Greek Orthodox, and eventually led to the Christianization of Belarus' and Russia.","---

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Foreign sources, very few in number, present the following story of Vladimir's conversion. [[Yahya of Antioch]] and his followers ([[al-Rudhrawari]], [[al-Makin]], [[Shams al-Din al-Ansari al-Dimashqi|Al-Dimashqi]], and [[ibn al-Athir]])<ref>Ibn al-Athir dates these events to 985 or 986.</ref> give essentially the same account. In 987, the generals [[Bardas Sclerus]] and [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phocas]] revolted against the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]]. Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

-In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]].

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith.

 Byzantine historians, starting with the continuation of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], assumed that the Rus' [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|raid against Constantinople in 860]] was a Byzantine success and attributed the presumed victory to [[the Intercession]] of the [[Theotokos]].

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity.

The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus', their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' were aware that a sizable portion of the Kievan population was Christian by 944. In the [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus' swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kievan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kiev at the time.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

 The '''Christianization of Kievan Rus'''' took place in several stages. In early 867, [[Photios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photius]] of Constantinople announced to other Christian patriarchs that the [[Rus' people|Rus']], baptized by his bishop, took to Christianity with particular enthusiasm. Photius's attempts at Christianizing the country seem to have entailed no lasting consequences, since the [[Primary Chronicle]] and other Slavonic sources describe the tenth-century Rus' as firmly entrenched in paganism. Following the Primary Chronicle, the definitive [[Christianization]] of [[Kievan Rus']] dates from the year 988 (the year is disputed<ref>Oleg Rapov, ''Russkaya tserkov v IX&ndash;pervoy treti XII veka'' (''The Russian Church from the 9th to the First 3rd of the 12th Century''). Moscow, 1988.</ref>), when [[Vladimir the Great]] was baptized in [[Chersonesus]] and proceeded to baptize his family and people in [[Kyiv|Kiev]]. The latter events are traditionally referred to as '''baptism of Rus' ''' ({{lang-ru|Крещение Руси}}; {{lang-ua|Хрещення Русі}}) in Ukrainian and Russian literature.

 With some modifications, the above story is repeated by Emperor [[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''. It is repeated by several generations of Byzantine historians, including [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Joannes Zonaras]]. That the imperial court and patriarchate regarded the 10th-century the Rus' as Christians is evident from the fact that the bishopric of Rus' was enumerated in the lists of Christian sees, compiled during the reigns of [[Leo the Wise]] and Constantine VII. There is also an ''argumentum ex silentio'': no Greek source recorded the second baptism of the Rus' in the 990s.

 During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. His religious reform failed. By the late 980s, he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.
 
 The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' reports that, in the year 986, Vladimir met with representatives from several religions. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Upon the meeting with [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]], Vladimir found their religion unsuitable due to its requirement to [[circumcise]] and [[taboo]]s against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus."" He also consulted with [[Jewish]] envoys (who may or may not have been [[Khazars]]), questioned them about Judaism but ultimately rejected it, saying that their loss of [[Jerusalem]] was evidence of their having been abandoned by [[God]].<ref>Primary Chronicle, year 6494 (986)</ref>

 In the year 987, as the result of a consultation with his [[boyar]]s, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. Of the [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]] the envoys reported there is no joy among them; only sorrow and a great stench. In the gloomy churches of the Germans his emissaries saw no beauty; but at [[Hagia Sophia]], where the full festival ritual of the Byzantine Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: ''""We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth,""'' they reported, ''""nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it.""''<ref>Primary Chronicle, year 6495 (987)</ref>

 In the Primary Chronicle, the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]].

 In the ''Primary Chronicle'', the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law.

 Foreign sources, very few in number, present the following story of Vladimir's conversion. [[Yahya of Antioch]] and his followers ([[al-Rudhrawari]], [[al-Makin]], [[Shams al-Din al-Ansari al-Dimashqi|Al-Dimashqi]], and [[ibn al-Athir]])<ref>Ibn al-Athir dates these events to 985 or 986.</ref> give essentially the same account. In 987, the generals [[Bardas Sclerus]] and [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phocas]] revolted against the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]]. Both rebels briefly joined forces and advanced on Constantinople. On September 14, 987, Bardas Phocas proclaimed himself emperor. Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Byzantine historians, starting with the continuation of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], assumed that the Rus' [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|raid against Constantinople in 860]] was a Byzantine success and attributed the presumed victory to [[the Intercession]] of the [[Theotokos]].

He narrates how the Byzantines galvanized the Rus' into conversion by their persuasive words and rich presents, including gold, silver, and precious tissues.

-During the first decade of Vladimir's reign, pagan reaction set in. [[Perun]] was chosen as the supreme deity of the Slavic pantheon and his [[Cult image|idol]] was placed on the hill by the royal palace. This revival of paganism was contemporaneous with similar attempts undertaken by [[Jarl Haakon]] in [[Norway]] and (possibly) [[Svein Forkbeard]] in [[Denmark]]. His religious reform failed. By the late 980s, he had found it necessary to adopt [[monotheism]] from abroad.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

-The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' reports that, in the year 986, Vladimir met with representatives from several religions. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Upon the meeting with [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]], Vladimir found their religion unsuitable due to its requirement to [[circumcise]] and [[taboo]]s against [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[pork]]; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: ""Drinking is the joy of the Rus."" He also consulted with [[Jewish]] envoys (who may or may not have been [[Khazars]]), questioned them about Judaism but ultimately rejected it, saying that their loss of [[Jerusalem]] was evidence of their having been abandoned by [[God]].<ref>Primary Chronicle, year 6494 (986)</ref>{{npsn|date=January 2023}}
-
-In the year 987, as the result of a consultation with his [[boyar]]s, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. Of the [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgarians of the Volga]] the envoys reported there is no joy among them; only sorrow and a great stench. In the gloomy churches of the Germans his emissaries saw no beauty; but at [[Hagia Sophia]], where the full festival ritual of the Byzantine Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: ''""We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth,""'' they reported, ''""nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it.""''<ref>Primary Chronicle, year 6495 (987)</ref>{{npsn|date=January 2023}}

-In the ''Primary Chronicle'', the account of Vladimir's baptism is preceded by the so-called Korsun' Legend. According to this apocryphal story, in 988 Vladimir captured the Greek town of Korsun' ([[Chersonesus]]) in Crimea, highly important commercially and politically. This campaign may have been dictated by his wish to secure the benefits promised to him by Basil II, when he had asked for the Rus' assistance against Phocas. In recompense for the evacuation of Chersonesos, Vladimir was promised the hand of the emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]]. Prior to the wedding, Vladimir was baptized (either in Chersonesos or in Kiev), taking the Christian name of Basil out of compliment to his imperial brother-in-law. The sacrament was followed by his marriage with the Byzantine princess.<ref>''Lavrentevskaia Letopis'', also called the ''Povest Vremennykh Let'', in '' [[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles|Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisey]]'' (PSRL), vol. 1, col.s 95-102.</ref>{{npsn|date=January 2023}} The alleged place of Vladimir's baptism in Chersonesos is marked by [[Chersonesus Cathedral|St. Vladimir's Cathedral]].{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Anxious to avoid the siege of his capital, Basil II turned to the Rus' for assistance, even though they were considered enemies at that time. Vladimir agreed, in exchange for a marital tie; he also agreed to accept Christianity as his religion and bring his people to the new faith. When the wedding arrangements were settled, Vladimir dispatched 6,000 troops to the Byzantine Empire and they helped to put down the revolt.<ref>Golden, P.B. (2006) ""Rus.""

 Byzantine historians, starting with the continuation of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], assumed that the Rus' [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|raid against Constantinople in 860]] was a Byzantine success and attributed the presumed victory to [[the Intercession]] of the [[Theotokos]]. This conviction dictated the following interpretation: awed by the miracles they witnessed under the walls of the imperial capital and grief-stricken at the disaster that befell them, the Rus' sent envoys to Photius and asked him to send a bishop to their land.<ref>Theophanes Continuatus, Ioannes Cameniata, Symeon Magister, Georgius Monachus.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity.

The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin form]] would be suppressed by the later Eastern Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus', their effect was not lasting.

This conviction dictated the following interpretation: awed by the miracles they witnessed under the walls of the imperial capital and grief-stricken at the disaster that befell them, the Rus' sent envoys to Photius and asked him to send a bishop to their land.<ref>Theophanes Continuatus, Ioannes Cameniata, Symeon Magister, Georgius Monachus.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Byzantine historians, starting with the continuation of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], assumed that the Rus' [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|raid against Constantinople in 860]] was a Byzantine success and attributed the presumed victory to [[the Intercession]] of the [[Theotokos]]. This conviction dictated the following interpretation: awed by the miracles they witnessed under the walls of the imperial capital and grief-stricken at the disaster that befell them, the Rus' sent envoys to Photius and asked him to send a bishop to their land.<ref>Theophanes Continuatus, Ioannes Cameniata, Symeon Magister, Georgius Monachus.

 On the other hand, [[Constantine Zuckerman]] argues that, in response to the initial request of the Rus', Photius (and Michael III) sent to the [[Rus' Khaganate]] a simple bishop. The pagans felt slighted at the low rank of the prelate and their Christian zeal evaporated. In September 867, Michael was assassinated by Basil, who (together with a new patriarch, Ignatius) sent to the Rus' an [[archbishop]] who propped up the religious fervor of the local leaders with rich presents. Parenthetically, the contemporaneous [[Christianization of Bulgaria]] was likewise effected in two stages: the Bulgars were offended when a simple bishop arrived to their capital from Constantinople and requested [[Pope Nicholas I]] to send them a higher-ranking church official. Such considerations were an important matter of political prestige.<ref>Zuckerman, Constantine.

 On the other hand, [[Constantine Zuckerman]] argues that, in response to the initial request of the Rus', Photius (and Michael III) sent to the [[Rus' Khaganate]] a simple bishop. The pagans felt slighted at the low rank of the prelate and their Christian zeal evaporated. In September 867, Michael was assassinated by Basil, who (together with a new patriarch, Ignatius) sent to the Rus' an [[archbishop]] who propped up the religious fervor of the local leaders with rich presents. Parenthetically, the contemporaneous [[Christianization of Bulgaria]] was likewise effected in two stages: the Bulgars were offended when a simple bishop arrived to their capital from Constantinople and requested [[Pope Nicholas I]] to send them a higher-ranking church official.

 Constantine's account precipitated a long-term dispute over whether the 9th-century Christianization of the Rus' went through two stages. One school of thought postulates that there was only one Christianization: wishing to glorify his ancestor, Constantine simply ascribed to Basil the missionary triumphs of his predecessor, Michael III.<ref>A.

-On the other hand, [[Constantine Zuckerman]] argues that, in response to the initial request of the Rus', Photius (and Michael III) sent to the [[Rus' Khaganate]] a simple bishop. The pagans felt slighted at the low rank of the prelate and their Christian zeal evaporated. In September 867, Michael was assassinated by Basil, who (together with a new patriarch, Ignatius) sent to the Rus' an [[archbishop]] who propped up the religious fervor of the local leaders with rich presents. Parenthetically, the contemporaneous [[Christianization of Bulgaria]] was likewise effected in two stages: the Bulgars were offended when a simple bishop arrived to their capital from Constantinople and requested [[Pope Nicholas I]] to send them a higher-ranking church official.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin form]] would have been suppressed by the later Eastern Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Byzantine historians, starting with the continuation of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], assumed that the Rus' [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|raid against Constantinople in 860]] was a Byzantine success and attributed the presumed victory to [[the Intercession]] of the [[Theotokos]]. This conviction dictated the following interpretation: awed by the miracles they witnessed under the walls of the imperial capital and grief-stricken at the disaster that befell them, the Rus' sent envoys to Photius and asked him to send a bishop to their land.<ref>Theophanes Continuatus, Ioannes Cameniata, Symeon Magister, Georgius Monachus.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin form]] would have been suppressed by the later Eastern Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin form]] would have been suppressed by the later Eastern Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 Byzantine historians, starting with the continuation of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], assumed that the Rus' [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|raid against Constantinople in 860]] was a Byzantine success and attributed the presumed victory to [[the Intercession]] of the [[Theotokos]]. This conviction dictated the following interpretation: awed by the miracles they witnessed under the walls of the imperial capital and grief-stricken at the disaster that befell them, the Rus' sent envoys to Photius and asked him to send a bishop to their land.<ref>Theophanes Continuatus, Ioannes Cameniata, Symeon Magister, Georgius Monachus.

 Whatever the scope of Photius's efforts to Christianize the Rus', their effect was not lasting. Although they fail to mention the mission of Photius, the authors of the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' were aware that a sizable portion of the Kyivan population was Christian by 944. In the [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (945)|Russo-Byzantine Treaty]], preserved in the text of the chronicle, the Christian part of the Rus' swear according to their faith, while the ruling prince and other non-Christians invoke [[Perun]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]] after the pagan custom. The Kyivan [[collegiate church]] of [[St. Elijah]] (whose cult in the Slavic countries was closely modeled on that of Perun) is mentioned in the text of the chronicle, leaving modern scholars to ponder how many churches existed in Kyiv at the time.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin form]] would have been suppressed by the later Eastern Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

"The ''baptism of Kyiv'' occured in 988, when the Prince of Rus', [[Vladimir I]], exhorted the residents of the capital city of Rus', Kyiv, to the Dnipr River for baptism. This mass baptism became the iconic inaugural event in the Christianization of the state of Kievan Rus'. This baptism made Eastern Christianity the state religion of Rus', and marked the beginning of the Ukrainian apostolic churches, Greek Catholic/Greek Orthodox, and eventually led to the Christianization of Belarus' and Russia.","---

 Byzantine historians, starting with the continuation of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], assumed that the Rus' [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|raid against Constantinople in 860]] was a Byzantine success and attributed the presumed victory to [[the Intercession]] of the [[Theotokos]]. This conviction dictated the following interpretation: awed by the miracles they witnessed under the walls of the imperial capital and grief-stricken at the disaster that befell them, the Rus' sent envoys to Photius and asked him to send a bishop to their land.<ref>Theophanes Continuatus, Ioannes Cameniata, Symeon Magister, Georgius Monachus.

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin form]] would have been suppressed by the later Eastern Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Although sometimes solely attributed to Vladimir/Volodymyr, the Christianization of Kievan Rus' was a long and complicated process that began before the state's formation.{{sfn|Katchanovski|Kohut|Nesebio|Yurkevich|2013|p=74}} As early as the 1st century CE, [[Greek colonisation|Greeks in the Black Sea Colonies]] converted to Christianity, although most of these lands never became part of Kievan Rus'.{{sfn|Katchanovski|Kohut|Nesebio|Yurkevich|2013|p=74}} 
 
-The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' (pages 7.21–9.4) records the legend of [[Andrew the Apostle]]'s mission to these coastal settlements, as well as blessing the site of present-day Kiev.{{sfn|Katchanovski|Kohut|Nesebio|Yurkevich|2013|p=74}} Andrew supposedly travelled from [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] towards [[Chersonesus]] (Korsun) in [[Crimea]], up the river [[Dnieper]], and reached the future location of [[Kyiv]], where he erected a cross.{{sfn|Thuis|2015|pp=10–11}} Next, he is said to have journeyed north to the [[Novgorod Slavs|Slovenes]] near the future site of [[Veliky Novgorod]], although he had a negative attitude towards their customs (particularly their washing in a hot steam bath, [[banya (sauna)|banya]]); then he visited Rome and returned to Sinope.{{sfn|Thuis|2015|p=11}}{{sfn|Santos Marinas|2011|p=327}} In a later passage of the ''Primary Chronicle'' under the year 6404 (898; page 28), makes confusing claims about how a certain Andronicus, supposedly a disciple of [[Paul the Apostle]], was the ""Apostle of the Slavs"", because he preached amongst the ""Moravians"" in ""Illyricum"", and the ""Rus{{'}}"" supposedly descended from the ""Slavs"", contradicting a whole lot of claims made elsewhere in the same ''Primary Chronicle''.{{sfn|Santos Marinas|2011|pp=327–328}} For one, the chronicle says explicitly ''sub anno'' 6491 (983): 'the Apostles were not by body here';{{efn|'Аще бо и тѣлъмь апостоли суть не были' (PVL 83.20–21).{{sfn|Ostrowski|Birnbaum|2014|loc=83.20–21}}}} 'the apostles did not teach here; and also the prophets did not prophecy here'{{efn|'сьде бо не суть учили апостоли, ни пророци прорекли.'

 Some of the earliest Kievan princes and princesses such as [[Askold and Dir]] and [[Olga of Kiev]] reportedly converted to Christianity, but [[Oleg the Wise]], [[Igor of Kiev]] and [[Sviatoslav I]] remained pagans.{{sfn|Katchanovski|Kohut|Nesebio|Yurkevich|2013|p=74–75}} According to some sources and historians, there was an attempt in the 9th century to Christianise Kievan Rus'.

The revision includes references to significant historical figures and events that are central to the narratives of both Ukrainian and Russian cultural heritage. The mention of Andrew the Apostle and the Christianization process can be sensitive, as these narratives are often used to assert cultural legitimacy and historical claims over the region.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin form]] would have been suppressed by the later Eastern Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Byzantine historians, starting with the continuation of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], assumed that the Rus' [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|raid against Constantinople in 860]] was a Byzantine success and attributed the presumed victory to [[the Intercession]] of the [[Theotokos]]. This conviction dictated the following interpretation: awed by the miracles they witnessed under the walls of the imperial capital and grief-stricken at the disaster that befell them, the Rus' sent envoys to Photius and asked him to send a bishop to their land.<ref>Theophanes Continuatus, Ioannes Cameniata, Symeon Magister, Georgius Monachus.

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

**Weaponised**: The use of ""Volodymyr"" and ""Kyiv"" reflects a Ukrainian perspective that emphasizes the correct Ukrainian names and historical context, which can be seen as an assertion of cultural identity and heritage in the face of Russian narratives. This shift in terminology can be interpreted as a subtle form of cultural weaponization, reinforcing national identity and historical claims.",Weaponised
"The ''baptism of Kyiv'' occured in 988, when the Prince of Rus', [[Vladimir I]], exhorted the residents of the capital city of Rus', Kyiv, to the Dnipr River for baptism. This mass baptism became the iconic inaugural event in the Christianization of the state of Kievan Rus'. This baptism made Eastern Christianity the state religion of Rus', and marked the beginning of the Ukrainian apostolic churches, Greek Catholic/Greek Orthodox, and eventually led to the Christianization of Belarus' and Russia.","---

 Byzantine historians, starting with the continuation of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], assumed that the Rus' [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|raid against Constantinople in 860]] was a Byzantine success and attributed the presumed victory to [[the Intercession]] of the [[Theotokos]]. This conviction dictated the following interpretation: awed by the miracles they witnessed under the walls of the imperial capital and grief-stricken at the disaster that befell them, the Rus' sent envoys to Photius and asked him to send a bishop to their land.<ref>Theophanes Continuatus, Ioannes Cameniata, Symeon Magister, Georgius Monachus.

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin form]] would have been suppressed by the later Eastern Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

During the reign of Vladimir's son [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav I]], Metropolitan [[Hilarion of Kiev|Ilarion]] authored the first known work of East Slavic literature, an elaborate oration in which he favourably compared Rus to other lands known as the ""[[Sermon on Law and Grace]]""{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}.

 At first, Vladimir baptized his twelve sons and many [[boyar]]s. He destroyed the wooden statues of [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan gods]] (which he had himself raised just eight years earlier).  They were either burnt or hacked into pieces, and the statue of [[Perun]] &mdash; the supreme god &mdash; was thrown into the Dnieper.<ref>{{cite book |last= Longsworth |first=Philip|date=2006|title=Russia: The Once and Future Empire from Pre-History to Putin|page=38 |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-36041-X}}</ref>
 
-Then Vladimir sent a message to all residents of Kyiv, ""rich, and poor, and beggars, and slaves"", to come to the river on the following day, lest they risk becoming the ""prince's enemies"". Large numbers of people came; some even brought infants with them. They were sent into the water while priests, who came from Chersonesos for the occasion, prayed.<ref>''Lavrent'' (PSRL 1), col. 102.</ref>

 To commemorate the event, Vladimir built the first stone [[church (building)|church]] of Kievan Rus', called the [[Church of the Tithes]], where his body and the body of his new wife were to repose. Another church was built on top of the hill where pagan statues stood before.<ref>''Lavrent'' (PSRL 1), cols. 108-9.</ref>

-The baptism of Kyiv was followed by similar ceremonies in other urban centres of the country. The [[Ioakim Chronicle]] says that Vladimir's uncle, [[Dobrynya]], forced the [[Novgorod]]ians into Christianity ""by fire"", while the local mayor, [[Putyata]], persuaded his compatriots to accept Christian faith ""by the sword"". At that same time, Bishop [[Ioakim Korsunianin]] built the first, wooden, [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|Cathedral of Holy Wisdom]] ""with 13 tops"" on the site of a pagan cemetery.<ref>''Novgorodskaia tretiaia letopis'', (PSRL 3), 208.

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

Y. Hamant (Paris, 1992), 139-147</ref> The Greek learning and book culture was adopted in Kiev and other centres of the country. Churches started to be built on the Byzantine model. During the reign of Vladimir's son [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav I]], Metropolitan [[Hilarion of Kiev|Ilarion]] authored the first known work of East Slavic literature, an elaborate oration in which he favourably compared Rus to other lands known as the ""[[Sermon on Law and Grace]]""{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}. The [[Ostromir Gospels]], produced in Novgorod during the same period, was the first dated East Slavic book fully preserved. But the only surviving work of lay literature, ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'', indicates that a degree of pagan worldview remained under Christian Kievan Rus'.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

 Sviatoslav's successor, [[Yaropolk I]] (r. 972–980), seems to have had a more conciliatory attitude towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adémar de Chabannes]] and the life of [[St. Romuald]] (by [[Pietro Damiani]]) actually document the mission of St. [[Bruno of Querfurt]] to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). [[Alexander Nazarenko]] suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose own rights to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin form]] would have been suppressed by the later Eastern Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.<ref>[[Alexander Nazarenko]].

**Analysis:** The revision appears to revert previous edits that may have aimed to standardize the spelling of names and places in a way that aligns with contemporary Ukrainian preferences (e.g., ""Kyiv"" instead of ""Kiev""). This could reflect a political stance regarding the recognition of Ukrainian cultural identity and heritage. The user comment indicates a desire to maintain the original text, which may suggest a resistance to changes that align with Ukrainian perspectives.

**Conclusion:** Weaponised. The reversion of these terms can be seen as an attempt to undermine the recognition of Ukrainian cultural identity, which is a sensitive issue in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.",Weaponised

"The ''baptism of Kyiv'' occured in 988, when the Prince of Rus', [[Vladimir I]], exhorted the residents of the capital city of Rus', Kyiv, to the Dnipr River for baptism. This mass baptism became the iconic inaugural event in the Christianization of the state of Kievan Rus'. This baptism made Eastern Christianity the state religion of Rus', and marked the beginning of the Ukrainian apostolic churches, Greek Catholic/Greek Orthodox, and eventually led to the Christianization of Belarus' and Russia.","---

 Paganism persisted in the country for a long time, surfacing during the [[Upper Volga Uprising]] and other occasional pagan protests. The northeastern part of the country, centred on [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]], was particularly hostile to the new religion.  Novgorod itself faced a pagan uprising as late as 1071, in which Bishop Fedor faced a real threat to his person; Prince Gleb Sviatoslavich broke up the crowd by chopping a sorcerer in half with an axe.<ref>Arsennii Nasonov, ed.

 In 1988, the faithful of the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox churches which have roots in the baptism of Kiev celebrated a millennium of Eastern Slavic Christianity. The great celebrations in [[Moscow]] changed the character of relationship between the Soviet state and the church. For the first time since 1917, numerous churches and monasteries were returned to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In Ukrainian communities around the world, members of various [[History of Christianity in Ukraine|Ukrainian churches]] also celebrated the Millennium of Christianity in [[Ukraine]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
