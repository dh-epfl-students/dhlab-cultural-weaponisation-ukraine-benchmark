+Old-Believer churches in Russia [[as of 2006|currently]] have started restoration of their property, although Old Believers (unlike the nearly-official mainstream Orthodoxy) face many difficulties in claiming their [[restitution]] rights for their churches. [[Moscow]] has churches for all the most important Old Believer branches: [[Rogozhskaya Zastava]] ([[Popovtsy]] of the [[Belokrinitskaya hierarchy]] official center), a cathedral for the [[Novozybkovskaya hierarchy]] in [[Zamoskvorech'ye]] and [[Preobrazhenskaya Zastava]] where [[Pomortsy]] and [[Fedoseevtsy]] coexist.

 By the opinion of Keston Institute, Protestants are widely present and may well outnumber the Orthodox in some places of [[Siberia]]. There are very few ""nominal"" believers among them: everywhere they preach, pray and often struggle against local bureaucracy to acquire their rights. Anyway, they are also regarded as respectable, hard-working citizens.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article684578.ece Timesonline Article]</ref>

 The first attempts to translate books of the Bible into modern Russian language of that time took place in 16th and 17th centuries. But the mentioned works (by deacon of Posolsky Prikaz Avraamiy Firsov, pastor E.Gluk, archbishop Methodiy (Smirnov)) were lost during political turbulence and wars.<ref>[http://www.portal-slovo.ru/rus/theology/9742/10739/ B.A.Tikhomirov, The early history of the Bible translation into Russian and Russian Bible Society], Russian</ref>
 The full-scale [[Bible]] translation into Russian language began in 1813 since the establishment of the [[Russian Bible Society]]. The full edition of the Bible with [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] was published in 1876. This work, called also [[Russian Synodal Bible]], is widely used by Protestant communities all over Russia and former USSR countries. Lately appeared several modern translations.<ref>[http://www.biblia.ru/translation/show/?2&start=0 Russian Bible Society, in Russian]</ref> The [[Russian Bible Society]] since its establishment in 1813 and up to 1826 distributed more than 500 thousand of Bible related books in 41 languages of Russia. Several times in 19-th and 20th centuries activities of the Society were stopped by reactionary policies of the Russian Government.

 The full-scale [[Bible]] translation into Russian language began in 1813 since the establishment of the [[Russian Bible Society]]. The full edition of the Bible with [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] was published in 1876. This work, called also [[Russian Synodal Bible]], is widely used by Protestant communities all over Russia and former USSR countries. Lately appeared several modern translations.<ref>[http://www.biblia.ru/translation/show/?2&start=0 Russian Bible Society, in Russian]</ref> The [[Russian Bible Society]] since its establishment in 1813 and up to 1826 distributed more than 500 thousand of Bible related books in 41 languages of Russia. Several times in 19-th and 20th centuries activities of the Society were stopped by reactionary policies of the Russian Government.
 
 It was restored in 1990-1991 after a pause connected with the Soviet regime restrictions.<ref>[http://www.biblia.ru/about/history/ History of Russian Bible Society, in Russian]

 Old-Believer churches in Russia {{As of|2006|alt=currently}} have started restoration of their property, although Old Believers (unlike the nearly-official mainstream Orthodoxy) face many difficulties in claiming their [[restitution]] rights for their churches. [[Moscow]] has churches for all the most important Old Believer branches: [[Rogozhskaya Zastava]] ([[Popovtsy]] of the [[Belokrinitskaya hierarchy]] official center), a cathedral for the [[Novozybkovskaya hierarchy]] in [[Zamoskvorech'ye]] and [[Preobrazhenskaya Zastava]] where [[Pomortsy]] and [[Fedoseevtsy]] coexist.

+==Restorationism==
+Certain Christian religions consider themselves to have [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restored primitive Christianity]] and do not consider themselves part of Protestantism. The largest such denominations are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].
+
+===Jehovah's Witnesses===
+''Zion's Watch Tower'' (now called ''[[The Watchtower]]'', the primary journal of the [[Watch Tower Society]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]) had subscribers in Russia as early as 1887, and another Witness publication quoted correspondence from a 1904 group in Russia. Early Russian adherent Semyon Kozlitsky, a Russian Orthodox seminary graduate, associated personally with [[Charles Taze Russell]] as early as 1891 and was an active Jehovah's Witness in Russia, [[Siberia]], and what is now [[Kazakhstan]] until his death in 1935.
+
+In the 1920s, ''The Watch Tower'' began to be published in Russian, and Russian-language congregations were established in the United States and elsewhere. Although there were restrictions in Russia itself, the [[Latvia]] branch translated and printed Russian-language literature and the [[Estonia]] branch broadcast Russian-language radio lectures. In 1935, the Watch Tower Society unsuccessfully attempted to establish a branch office in the [[Soviet Union]] to support the Witnesses already there.
+{{Quote box

In new settlements where no one had heard of their religious confession, Jehovah’s Witnesses ‘infected’ the locals by their faith and their loyalty to it.

+By 1939, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were already residing in the [[Baltic states]] when the Soviet Union absorbed those formerly independent countries. In the 1940s, the Soviet government forcibly dispersed thousands of Witnesses in a program later described by Dr. N. S. Gordienko, a professor at [[Herzen University]] as having had ""just the opposite of what was expected; they wanted to weaken the organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the USSR, but in fact they only strengthened it"".

+===Mormons===
+<!---Please do not change section title, which was chosen explicitly to include so-called ""Russian Mormonism"". --->
+In the [[Novouzensk]] region about 1855, Ivan Grigorev Kanygin founded religious communities with untraditional marriage and communal practices they derived from the [[New Testament]]. Although they called themselves Communists or Methodists (due to a claimed association with [[Methodism]]), an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[priest]] named Khrisanf Rozhdestvenskiy in 1869 labeled them ""Mormons"" after the contemporaneous American movement, and the term was thereafter applied pejoratively to such adherents. In the 1870s, an unrelated community developed near the [[Volga]] city of [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] which avoided alcohol, tobacco, and swearing, cooperated in commercial enterprises, and governed themselves by ""[[apostle]]s"" and ""[[prophet]]s"". Adherents refused to discuss their theological beliefs with outsiders, and it seems that others incorrectly but perhaps sincerely identified them with Mormonism. The ""Samara Mormons"" came to tolerate the name into the 20th century, though they too had no known connection to the actual [[Latter Day Saint movement]].
+
+[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] established its first congregation in Russia in 1990, and the Church was recognized in May 1991. By 2010, the Church reported membership of 20,276 in 126 congregations in Russia.<ref>""Country Profiles: Russia"", ''LDS.org The Official Church Resource...'', [http://lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/russia Retrieved 2010-08-04]</ref>

 == Bible translation ==
 {{main|Russian Bible Society}}
 The first attempts to translate books of the Bible into modern Russian language of that time took place in 16th and 17th centuries. But the mentioned works (by deacon of Posolsky Prikaz Avraamiy Firsov, pastor E.Gluk, archbishop Methodiy (Smirnov)) were lost during political turbulence and wars.
 
+===Makarios Bible===
+Mikhail Iakovlevich Glukharev, known as [[Archimandrite]] Makarios, was a Russian Orthodox missionary who translated most of the [[Old Testament]] between 1839 and 1847, while a contemporary associate named Gerasim Petrovich Pavsky translated [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]]. Makarios was unable to publish the translation during his lifetime, but a journal called ''Orthodox Review'' acquired and published the ''Makarios Bible'' in installments between 1860 and 1867, under the title ''An Experiment of Translation Into the Russian Language''.
+
+The aging magazines, more than a century old, were discovered in 1993 in the rare-books section of the [[Russian National Library]], and permission was given for the work to be copied and prepared for publication. In January 1997, the ''Religious Organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia'' ""arranged for nearly 300,000 copies of this Bible to be printed in Italy for distribution throughout Russia and the many other countries where Russian is spoken. In addition to Makarios’ translation of most of the Hebrew Scriptures, this edition of the Bible contains Pavsky’s translation of Psalms as well as the Orthodox Church-authorized synodal translation of the Greek Scriptures.""<ref>""A Hidden Treasure Comes to Light"", ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1997, pages 22-27</ref>
+
+===Russian Bible Society===
 The full-scale [[Bible]] translation into Russian language began in 1813 since the establishment of the [[Russian Bible Society]]. The full edition of the Bible with [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] was published in 1876. This work, called also [[Russian Synodal Bible]], is widely used by Protestant communities all over Russia and former USSR countries. Lately appeared several modern translations.<ref>[http://www.biblia.ru/translation/show/?2&start=0 Russian Bible Society, in Russian]</ref> The [[Russian Bible Society]] since its establishment in 1813 and up to 1826 distributed more than 500 thousand of Bible related books in 41 languages of Russia. Several times in 19-th and 20th centuries activities of the Society were stopped by reactionary policies of the Russian Government.
 
 It was restored in 1990-1991 after a pause connected with the Soviet regime restrictions.<ref>[http://www.biblia.ru/about/history/ History of Russian Bible Society, in Russian]
 </ref>
 
 The opening ceremony of the Building of the Russian Bible Society in Moscow was visited by representatives of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], and Protestant churches, who joined their efforts in Bible translation and distribution cause. The editions of Society are based on the universal doctrine of the early Christian church and include non-confessional comments. Over 1,000,000 Bible related books are printed per year by that institution. The Bible is also being translated into native languages and dialects of Russia's ethnic groups.
+
+===New World Translation===
+In 2002, the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania]] released ''Holy Bible (with New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures)'' in Russian.<ref>""Announcements"", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', February 2002, page 7</ref> The complete ''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'' in Russian was released in 2007.<ref>""Russia"", ''2008 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', ©2007 Watch Tower, page 237</ref> In 2010, ''New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures'' (the New Testament) was released in [[Russian Sign Language]].
+
+The ''New World Translation'' is favored and distributed by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

 ===Makarios Bible===
 Mikhail Iakovlevich Glukharev, known as [[Archimandrite]] Makarios, was a Russian Orthodox missionary who translated most of the [[Old Testament]] between 1839 and 1847, while a contemporary associate named Gerasim Petrovich Pavsky translated [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]]. Makarios was unable to publish the translation during his lifetime, but a journal called ''Orthodox Review'' acquired and published the ''Makarios Bible'' in installments between 1860 and 1867, under the title ''An Experiment of Translation Into the Russian Language''.
 
-The aging magazines, more than a century old, were discovered in 1993 in the rare-books section of the [[Russian National Library]], and permission was given for the work to be copied and prepared for publication. In January 1997, the ''Religious Organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia'' ""arranged for nearly 300,000 copies of this Bible to be printed in Italy for distribution throughout Russia and the many other countries where Russian is spoken. In addition to Makarios’ translation of most of the Hebrew Scriptures, this edition of the Bible contains Pavsky’s translation of Psalms as well as the Orthodox Church-authorized synodal translation of the Greek Scriptures.""<ref>""A Hidden Treasure Comes to Light"", ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1997, pages 22-27</ref> love you

 In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were surveiled, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government, which seems to have taken decades to conclude that the faith was not a threat. According to Witness Viktor Gutshmidt, the [[prosecutor general]] for the Russian Republic in 1961 privately acknowledged that and guessed that perhaps 500,000 in the Soviet Union might eventually become Witnesses if restrictions were lifted. By 1971, there were more than 4500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union.
 
-In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were surveiled, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government, which seems to have taken decades to conclude that the faith was not a threat. According to Witness Viktor Gutshmidt, the [[prosecutor general]] for the Russian Republic in 1961 privately acknowledged that and guessed that perhaps 500,000 in the Soviet Union might eventually become Witnesses if restrictions were lifted. By 1971, there were more than 4500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union.
+When the religion was formally recognized in March 1991, the organization reported 15,987 members in Russia. Beginning in 1993, graduates of [[Watchtower Bible School of Gilead#Gilead School extensions|Gilead Extension School]] in Germany began to be assigned to Russia as missionaries to support the local Witnesses already there. Between 1996 and 2006, Jehovah's Witnesses trained thousands of full-time ministers in Russia.<ref>""Russia"", ''2008 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', ©2007 Watch Tower, pages 66-255</ref>

 ===""Russian Mormons"" and Latter-day Saints===
 In the [[Novouzensk]] region about 1855, Ivan Grigorev Kanygin founded religious communities with untraditional marriage and communal practices they derived from the [[New Testament]]. Although they called themselves Communists or Methodists (due to a claimed association with [[Methodism]]), an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[priest]] named Khrisanf Rozhdestvenskiy in 1869 labeled them ""Mormons"" after the contemporaneous American movement, and the term was thereafter applied pejoratively to such adherents. In the 1870s, an unrelated community developed near the [[Volga]] city of [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] which avoided alcohol, tobacco, and swearing, cooperated in commercial enterprises, and governed themselves by ""[[apostle]]s"" and ""[[prophet]]s"". Adherents refused to discuss their theological beliefs with outsiders, and it seems that others incorrectly but perhaps sincerely identified them with [[Latter Day Saint movement|Mormonism]]. The ""Samara Mormons"" came to tolerate the name into the 20th century, though they too had no known connection to the actual [[Latter Day Saint movement]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}",/* Jehovah's Witnesses */ remove redundant,Jeffro77,2015-01-04T06:10:02Z,"Removed a reference to ""Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses"" in the context of the Soviet Union.

 By 1939, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were already residing in the [[Baltic states]] when the Soviet Union absorbed those formerly independent countries. In the 1940s, the Soviet government forcibly dispersed thousands of Witnesses in a program named [[Operation North]], later described by Dr. N. S. Gordienko, a professor at [[Herzen University]] as having had ""just the opposite of what was expected; they wanted to weaken the organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the USSR, but in fact they only strengthened it"". In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union.

**Justification**: The revision includes a more nuanced presentation of the statistics regarding religious affiliation in Russia, which could be interpreted as an attempt to present a more favorable view of Russian Orthodoxy.

 By 1939, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were already residing in the [[Baltic states]] when the Soviet Union absorbed those formerly independent countries. In the 1940s, the Soviet government forcibly dispersed thousands of Witnesses in a program named [[Operation North]], later described by Dr. N. S. Gordienko, a professor at [[Herzen University]] as having had ""just the opposite of what was expected; they wanted to weaken the organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the USSR, but in fact they only strengthened it"". In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union.

Beginning in 1993, graduates of [[Watchtower Bible School of Gilead#Gilead School extensions|Gilead Extension School]] in Germany began to be assigned to Russia as missionaries to support the local Witnesses already there.

 In 1971, the [[Moscow Patriarchate]] revoked the [[anathema#Orthodoxy|anathemas]] placed on the Old Believers in the 17th century, but most Old Believer communities have not returned to Communion with other Orthodox Christians.
 
 As of 2006, the total number of Old Believers is estimated from 500,000 to 1 million, some living in isolated communities to which they fled centuries ago to avoid persecution. An Old Believer parish in the [[United States]] has entered into communion with the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]]. Old-Believer churches in Russia have begun restoration of their property, although Old Believers face many difficulties in claiming [[restitution]] rights for their churches. [[Moscow]] has churches for the most important Old Believer branches: [[Rogozhskaya Zastava]] ([[Popovtsy]] of the [[Belokrinitskaya hierarchy]] official center), a cathedral for the Novozybkovskaya hierarchy in [[Zamoskvorech'ye]] and [[Preobrazhenskaya Zastava]] where [[Pomortsy]] and [[Fedoseevtsy]] coexist.

 In 1855 in the [[Novouzensk]] region, Ivan Grigorev Kanygin founded religious communities involving untraditional marriage and communal practices they derived from the [[New Testament]]. Although they called themselves Communists or Methodists (due to a claimed association with [[Methodism]]), an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[priest]] named Khrisanf Rozhdestvenskiy labeled them ""Mormons"" in 1869 after the contemporaneous American movement, and the term was thereafter applied pejoratively to such adherents. In the 1870s, a separate community developed near the [[Volga]] city of [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] whose members avoided alcohol, tobacco and swearing, cooperated in commercial enterprises, and were governed by ""[[apostle]]s"" and ""[[prophet]]s"". Adherents refused to discuss their theological beliefs with outsiders, and their beliefs were mistakenly identified with [[Latter Day Saint movement|Mormonism]].

 By 1939, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were residing in the [[Baltic states]] when the Soviet Union absorbed those formerly independent countries. In the 1940s, the Soviet government forcibly dispersed thousands of Witnesses, in a program named [[Operation North]], later described by Dr. N. S. Gordienko, a professor at [[Herzen University]] as having ""just the opposite of what was expected; they wanted to weaken the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in the USSR, but in fact they only strengthened it"". In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4,500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union. When the denomination was formally recognized in March 1991, the organization reported 15,987 members in Russia. Beginning in 1993, Witness missionaries from Germany were assigned to Russia to support the local members.

 In 1971, the [[Moscow Patriarchate]] revoked the [[anathema#Orthodoxy|anathemas]] placed on the Old Believers in the 17th century, but most Old Believer communities have not returned to Communion with other Orthodox Christians.
 
 As of 2006, the total number of Old Believers is estimated from 500,000 to 1 million, some living in isolated communities to which they fled centuries ago to avoid persecution. An Old Believer parish in the [[United States]] has entered into communion with the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]]. Old-Believer churches in Russia have begun restoration of their property, although Old Believers face many difficulties in claiming [[restitution]] rights for their churches. [[Moscow]] has churches for the most important Old Believer branches: [[Rogozhskaya Zastava]] ([[Popovtsy]] of the [[Belokrinitskaya hierarchy]] official center), a cathedral for the Novozybkovskaya hierarchy in [[Zamoskvorech'ye]] and [[Preobrazhenskaya Zastava]] where [[Pomortsy]] and [[Fedoseevtsy]] coexist.

 In 1971, the [[Moscow Patriarchate]] revoked the [[anathema#Orthodoxy|anathemas]] placed on the Old Believers in the 17th century, but most Old Believer communities have not returned to Communion with other Orthodox Christians.
 
 As of 2006, the total number of Old Believers is estimated from 500,000 to 1 million, some living in isolated communities to which they fled centuries ago to avoid persecution. An Old Believer parish in the [[United States]] has entered into communion with the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]]. Old-Believer churches in Russia have begun restoration of their property, although Old Believers face many difficulties in claiming [[restitution]] rights for their churches. [[Moscow]] has churches for the most important Old Believer branches: [[Rogozhskaya Zastava]] ([[Popovtsy]] of the [[Belokrinitskaya hierarchy]] official center), a cathedral for the Novozybkovskaya hierarchy in [[Zamoskvorech'ye]] and [[Preobrazhenskaya Zastava]] where [[Pomortsy]] and [[Fedoseevtsy]] coexist.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4,500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union. When the denomination was formally recognized in March 1991, the organization reported 15,987 members in Russia. Beginning in 1993, Witness missionaries from Germany were assigned to Russia to support the local members. By 2014, Jehovah's Witnesses reported over 170,000 members in Russia.<ref>{{cite book|title=2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=184}}</ref>

 ''Zion's Watch Tower'' (now called ''[[The Watchtower]]'', the primary journal of the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]]) had subscribers in Russia as early as 1887.<!--Reducing tangential historical detail based only on primary sources and lacking notability... [Early Russian adherent Semyon Kozlitsky, a Russian Orthodox seminary graduate, associated personally with [[Charles Taze Russell]] as early as 1891 and was a member of the [[Bible Student movement]] in Russia, [[Siberia]], and what is now [[Kazakhstan]] until his death in 1935. In the 1920s, ''The Watch Tower'' was published in Russian, and Russian-language congregations were established in the United States and elsewhere.Although there were restrictions in Russia itself, the [[Latvia]] branch translated and printed Russian-language literature and the [[Estonia]] branch broadcast Russian-language radio lectures.]--> In 1935, the Watch Tower Society unsuccessfully attempted to establish a branch office in the [[Soviet Union]] to support members already there. By 1939, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were residing in the [[Baltic states]] when the Soviet Union absorbed those formerly independent countries. In the 1940s, the Soviet government forcibly dispersed thousands of Witnesses, in a program named [[Operation North]], later described by Dr. N. S. Gordienko, a professor at [[Herzen University]] as having ""just the opposite of what was expected; they wanted to weaken the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in the USSR, but in fact they only strengthened it"". In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4,500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union. When the denomination was formally recognized in March 1991, the organization reported 15,987 members in Russia. Beginning in 1993, Witness missionaries from Germany were assigned to Russia to support the local members. By 2014, Jehovah's Witnesses reported over 170,000 members in Russia.<ref>{{cite book|title=2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=184}}</ref><!--Please provide secondary source(s) for this history-->

 Mikhail Iakovlevich Glukharev, known as [[Archimandrite]] Makarios, was a Russian Orthodox missionary who translated most of the [[Old Testament]] between 1839 and 1847, while a contemporary associate named Gerasim Petrovich Pavsky translated [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]]. Makarios was unable to publish his translation, but a journal called ''Orthodox Review'' acquired and published the ''Makarios Bible'' in installments between 1860 and 1867, under the title ''An Experiment of Translation Into the Russian Language''. The magazines were rediscovered in 1993 in the rare-books section of the [[Russian National Library]], which gave permission for the works to be published. In January 1997, the Watch Tower Society arranged for publication and distribution of the translation throughout Russia.<ref>""A Hidden Treasure Comes to Light"", ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1997, pages 22-27</ref><!--Secondary source please-->

+===Russian Bible Society===
+Full-scale translation of the [[Bible]] into Russian began in 1813, with the establishment of the [[Russian Bible Society]]. The complete Bible comprising the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] was published in 1876. This work, called the [[Russian Synodal Bible]], is widely used by Protestant communities in Russia and former Soviet countries.<ref>[http://www.biblia.ru/translation/show/?2&start=0 Russian Bible Society, in Russian]</ref> From 1813 until 1826, the Russian Bible Society distributed more than 500,000 Bible-related books in 41 languages in Russia. During the 19th and 20th centuries, activities of the Society were stopped by reactionary policies of the Russian government. It was restored in 1990&ndash;1991 when Soviet regime restrictions eased.<ref>[http://www.biblia.ru/about/history/ History of Russian Bible Society, in Russian]</ref>
+
+The opening ceremony of the Russian Bible Society in Moscow was visited by representatives of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]] and Protestant churches, who combined their Bible translation and distribution efforts. The Russian Bible Society produces over 1,000,000 Bible-related books per year. The Society also translates the Bible into the languages and dialects of various ethnic groups throughout Russia.
 
 ===Makarios Bible===
-Mikhail Iakovlevich Glukharev, known as [[Archimandrite]] Makarios, was a Russian Orthodox missionary who translated most of the [[Old Testament]] between 1839 and 1847, while a contemporary associate named Gerasim Petrovich Pavsky translated [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]]. Makarios was unable to publish the translation during his lifetime, but a journal called ''Orthodox Review'' acquired and published the ''Makarios Bible'' in installments between 1860 and 1867, under the title ''An Experiment of Translation Into the Russian Language''.
-
-The aging magazines, more than a century old, were discovered in 1993 in the rare-books section of the [[Russian National Library]], and permission was given for the work to be copied and prepared for publication. In January 1997, the ''Religious Organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia'' ""arranged for nearly 300,000 copies of this Bible to be printed in Italy for distribution throughout Russia and the many other countries where Russian is spoken. In addition to Makarios’ translation of most of the Hebrew Scriptures, this edition of the Bible contains Pavsky’s translation of Psalms as well as the Orthodox Church-authorized synodal translation of the Greek Scriptures.""<ref>""A Hidden Treasure Comes to Light"", ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1997, pages 22-27</ref>

+Old Believers are Russian Orthodox Christians who maintain the liturgical and ritual practices of the Eastern Orthodox Church as they were before the reforms of [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]]. They split from the mainstream Russian Orthodox Church in the XVII century. 
+
 In 1971, the [[Moscow Patriarchate]] revoked the [[anathema#Orthodoxy|anathemas]] placed on the Old Believers in the 17th century, but most Old Believer communities have not returned to Communion with other Orthodox Christians.
 
 As of 2006, the total number of Old Believers is estimated from 500,000 to 1 million, some living in isolated communities to which they fled centuries ago to avoid persecution. An Old Believer parish in the [[United States]] has entered into communion with the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]]. Old-Believer churches in Russia have begun restoration of their property, although Old Believers face many difficulties in claiming [[restitution]] rights for their churches. [[Moscow]] has churches for the most important Old Believer branches: [[Rogozhskaya Zastava]] ([[Popovtsy]] of the [[Belokrinitskaya hierarchy]] official center), a cathedral for the Novozybkovskaya hierarchy in [[Zamoskvorech'ye]] and [[Preobrazhenskaya Zastava]] where [[Pomortsy]] and [[Fedoseevtsy]] coexist.",/* Old Believers */,Beaumain,2019-09-17T16:54:00Z,"**Added context about Old Believers and their historical relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church.**

 Some Protestants, especially at the provincial level, report government restrictions and obstruction of their activities by local authorities. In April 2007, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] obliged Russia to pay €10,000 as non-pecuniary damages for the refusal to register the Moscow branch of the [[Salvation Army]]. One [[Baptist]] missionary and minister said, ""every religion outside Russian Orthodoxy is considered a cult, including Protestantism.""<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bpnews.net/48775/religious-freedom-dying-in-russia-missionary-says|title= Religious Freedom Dying in Russia}}</ref>

 ''Zion's Watch Tower'' (now called ''[[The Watchtower]]'', the primary journal of the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]]) had subscribers in Russia as early as 1887.<!--Reducing tangential historical detail based only on primary sources and lacking notability... [Early Russian adherent Semyon Kozlitsky, a Russian Orthodox seminary graduate, associated personally with [[Charles Taze Russell]] as early as 1891 and was a member of the [[Bible Student movement]] in Russia, [[Siberia]], and what is now [[Kazakhstan]] until his death in 1935. In the 1920s, ''The Watch Tower'' was published in Russian, and Russian-language congregations were established in the United States and elsewhere.Although there were restrictions in Russia itself, the [[Latvia]] branch translated and printed Russian-language literature and the [[Estonia]] branch broadcast Russian-language radio lectures.]--> In 1935, the Watch Tower Society unsuccessfully attempted to establish a branch office in the [[Soviet Union]] to support members already there. By 1939, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were residing in the [[Baltic states]] when the Soviet Union absorbed those formerly independent countries. In the 1940s, the Soviet government forcibly dispersed thousands of Witnesses, in a program named [[Operation North]], later described by Dr. N. S. Gordienko, a professor at [[Herzen University]] as having ""just the opposite of what was expected; they wanted to weaken the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in the USSR, but in fact they only strengthened it"". In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4,500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union. When the denomination was formally recognized in March 1991, the organization reported 15,987 members in Russia. Beginning in 1993, Witness missionaries from Germany were assigned to Russia to support the local members. By 2014, Jehovah's Witnesses reported over 170,000 members in Russia.<ref>{{cite book|title=2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=184}}</ref><!--Please provide secondary source(s) for this history-->

 Some eparchies are organized into [[exarchate]]s, or autonomous churches.

The [[Chinese Orthodox Church|Chinese]] and [[Japanese Orthodox Church]]es were granted full autonomy by the Moscow Patriarchate, but this autonomy is not universally recognized. Smaller eparchies are usually governed by a single bishop. Larger eparchies, exarchates, and autonomous churches are governed by [[Metropolitan archbishop]]s and sometimes have one or more bishops assigned to them. The highest level of authority in the Church is represented by the [[Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia]], head of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Holy Synod is the governing body of the Church between the Bishops' Councils.

[Early Russian adherent Semyon Kozlitsky, a Russian Orthodox seminary graduate, associated personally with [[Charles Taze Russell]] as early as 1891 and was a member of the [[Bible Student movement]] in Russia, [[Siberia]], and what is now [[Kazakhstan]] until his death in 1935. In the 1920s, ''The Watch Tower'' was published in Russian, and Russian-language congregations were established in the United States and elsewhere.Although there were restrictions in Russia itself, the [[Latvia]] branch translated and printed Russian-language literature and the [[Estonia]] branch broadcast Russian-language radio lectures.]--> In 1935, the Watch Tower Society unsuccessfully attempted to establish a branch office in the [[Soviet Union]] to support members already there. By 1939, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were residing in the [[Baltic states]] when the Soviet Union absorbed those formerly independent countries. In the 1940s, the Soviet government forcibly dispersed thousands of Witnesses, in a program named [[Operation North]], later described by Dr. N. S. Gordienko, a professor at [[Herzen University]] as having ""just the opposite of what was expected; they wanted to weaken the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in the USSR, but in fact they only strengthened it"". In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4,500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union. When the denomination was formally recognized in March 1991, the organization reported 15,987 members in Russia. Beginning in 1993, Witness missionaries from Germany were assigned to Russia to support the local members. By 2014, Jehovah's Witnesses reported over 170,000 members in Russia.<ref>{{cite book|title=2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=184}}</ref><!--Please provide secondary source(s) for this history-->

-The Russian Orthodox Church is organized in a hierarchical structure. Each church and its attendees constitute a [[parish]] (''prikhod''). All parishes in a geographical region belong to an [[eparchy]] (''eparkhiya''&mdash;equivalent to a Western [[diocese]]). Eparchies are governed by [[bishop]]s (''episkope'' or ''archierey''). There are around 130 Russian Orthodox eparchies worldwide. As of February 2, 2010, the Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) has 160 dioceses including 30,142 parishes served by 207 bishops, 28,434 priests and 3,625 deacons. There are 788 monasteries, including 386 for men and 402 for women.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/1061651.html Доклад Святейшего Патриарха Кирилла на Архиерейском cовещании 2 февраля 2010 года] patriarchia.ru February 2, 2010</ref>
 
-Some eparchies are organized into [[exarchate]]s, or autonomous churches. These include the [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Belarusian]], [[Latvian Orthodox Church|Latvian]], [[Moldovan Orthodox Church|Moldovan]] and [[Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate|Estonian Orthodox churches]]. The [[Chinese Orthodox Church|Chinese]] and [[Japanese Orthodox Church]]es were granted full autonomy by the Moscow Patriarchate, but this autonomy is not universally recognized. Smaller eparchies are usually governed by a single bishop. Larger eparchies, exarchates, and autonomous churches are governed by [[Metropolitan archbishop]]s and sometimes have one or more bishops assigned to them. The highest level of authority in the Church is represented by the [[Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia]], head of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Holy Synod is the governing body of the Church between the Bishops' Councils.

+The Russian Orthodox Church is organized in a hierarchical structure. Each church and its attendees constitute a [[parish]] (''prikhod''). All parishes in a geographical region belong to an [[eparchy]] (''eparkhiya''&mdash;equivalent to a Western [[diocese]]). Eparchies are governed by [[bishop]]s (''episkope'' or ''archierey''). There are around 130 Russian Orthodox eparchies worldwide. As of February 2, 2010, the Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) has 160 dioceses including 30,142 parishes served by 207 bishops, 28,434 priests and 3,625 deacons. There are 788 monasteries, including 386 for men and 402 for women.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/1061651.html Доклад Святейшего Патриарха Кирилла на Архиерейском cовещании 2 февраля 2010 года] patriarchia.ru February 2, 2010</ref>

The [[Chinese Orthodox Church|Chinese]] and [[Japanese Orthodox Church]]es were granted full autonomy by the Moscow Patriarchate, but this autonomy is not universally recognized. Smaller eparchies are usually governed by a single bishop. Larger eparchies, exarchates, and autonomous churches are governed by [[Metropolitan archbishop]]s and sometimes have one or more bishops assigned to them. The highest level of authority in the Church is represented by the [[Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia]], head of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Holy Synod is the governing body of the Church between the Bishops' Councils.

 ''Zion's Watch Tower'' (now called ''[[The Watchtower]]'', the primary journal of the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]]) had subscribers in Russia as early as 1887.<!--Reducing tangential historical detail based only on primary sources and lacking notability... [Early Russian adherent Semyon Kozlitsky, a Russian Orthodox seminary graduate, associated personally with [[Charles Taze Russell]] as early as 1891 and was a member of the [[Bible Student movement]] in Russia, [[Siberia]], and what is now [[Kazakhstan]] until his death in 1935. In the 1920s, ''The Watch Tower'' was published in Russian, and Russian-language congregations were established in the United States and elsewhere.Although there were restrictions in Russia itself, the [[Latvia]] branch translated and printed Russian-language literature and the [[Estonia]] branch broadcast Russian-language radio lectures.]--> In 1935, the Watch Tower Society unsuccessfully attempted to establish a branch office in the [[Soviet Union]] to support members already there. By 1939, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were residing in the [[Baltic states]] when the Soviet Union absorbed those formerly independent countries. In the 1940s, the Soviet government forcibly dispersed thousands of Witnesses, in a program named [[Operation North]], later described by Dr. N. S. Gordienko, a professor at [[Herzen University]] as having ""just the opposite of what was expected; they wanted to weaken the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in the USSR, but in fact, they only strengthened it"". In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4,500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union. When the denomination was formally recognized in March 1991, the organization reported 15,987 members in Russia. Beginning in 1993, Witness missionaries from Germany were assigned to Russia to support the local members. By 2014, Jehovah's Witnesses reported over 170,000 members in Russia.<ref>{{cite book|title=2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=184}}</ref><!--Please provide secondary source(s) for this history-->

 ''Zion's Watch Tower'' (now called ''[[The Watchtower]]'', the primary journal of the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]]) had subscribers in Russia as early as 1887.<!--Reducing tangential historical detail based only on primary sources and lacking notability... [Early Russian adherent Semyon Kozlitsky, a Russian Orthodox seminary graduate, associated personally with [[Charles Taze Russell]] as early as 1891 and was a member of the [[Bible Student movement]] in Russia, [[Siberia]], and what is now [[Kazakhstan]] until his death in 1935. In the 1920s, ''The Watch Tower'' was published in Russian, and Russian-language congregations were established in the United States and elsewhere.Although there were restrictions in Russia itself, the [[Latvia]] branch translated and printed Russian-language literature and the [[Estonia]] branch broadcast Russian-language radio lectures.]--> In 1935, the Watch Tower Society unsuccessfully attempted to establish a branch office in the [[Soviet Union]] to support members already there. By 1939, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were residing in the [[Baltic states]] when the Soviet Union absorbed those formerly independent countries. In the 1940s, the Soviet government forcibly dispersed thousands of Witnesses, in a program named [[Operation North]], later described by Dr. N. S. Gordienko, a professor at [[Herzen University]] as having ""just the opposite of what was expected; they wanted to weaken the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in the USSR, but in fact, they only strengthened it"". In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4,500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union. When the denomination was formally recognized in March 1991, the organization reported 15,987 members in Russia. Beginning in 1993, Witness missionaries from Germany were assigned to Russia to support the local members. By 2014, Jehovah's Witnesses reported over 170,000 members in Russia.<ref>{{cite book|title=2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=184}}</ref><!--Please provide secondary source(s) for this history-->

 ===Jehovah's Witnesses===
 ''Zion's Watch Tower'' (now called ''[[The Watchtower]]'', the primary journal of the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]]) had subscribers in Russia as early as 1887.<!--Reducing tangential historical detail based only on primary sources and lacking notability... [Early Russian adherent Semyon Kozlitsky, a Russian Orthodox seminary graduate, associated personally with [[Charles Taze Russell]] as early as 1891 and was a member of the [[Bible Student movement]] in Russia, [[Siberia]], and what is now [[Kazakhstan]] until his death in 1935. In the 1920s, ''The Watch Tower'' was published in Russian, and Russian-language congregations were established in the United States and elsewhere.Although there were restrictions in Russia itself, the [[Latvia]] branch translated and printed Russian-language literature and the [[Estonia]] branch broadcast Russian-language radio lectures.]--> In 1935, the Watch Tower Society unsuccessfully attempted to establish a branch office in the [[Soviet Union]] to support members already there. By 1939, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were residing in the [[Baltic states]] when the Soviet Union absorbed those formerly independent countries. In the 1940s, the Soviet government forcibly dispersed thousands of Witnesses, in a program named [[Operation North]], later described by Dr. N. S. Gordienko, a professor at [[Herzen University]] as having ""just the opposite of what was expected; they wanted to weaken the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in the USSR, but in fact, they only strengthened it"". In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4,500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union. When the denomination was formally recognized in March 1991, the organization reported 15,987 members in Russia. Beginning in 1993, Witness missionaries from Germany were assigned to Russia to support the local members. By 2014, Jehovah's Witnesses reported over 170,000 members in Russia.<ref>{{cite book|title=2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=184}}</ref><!--Please provide secondary source(s) for this history-->",case fix (via [[WP:JWB]]),Dicklyon,2022-11-30T03:41:41Z,"The change made in this revision is a **case fix** in the term ""the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,"" where ""The"" was changed to ""the.""

 ''Zion's Watch Tower'' (now called ''[[The Watchtower]]'', the primary journal of the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]]) had subscribers in Russia as early as 1887.<!--Reducing tangential historical detail based only on primary sources and lacking notability... [Early Russian adherent Semyon Kozlitsky, a Russian Orthodox seminary graduate, associated personally with [[Charles Taze Russell]] as early as 1891 and was a member of the [[Bible Student movement]] in Russia, [[Siberia]], and what is now [[Kazakhstan]] until his death in 1935. In the 1920s, ''The Watch Tower'' was published in Russian, and Russian-language congregations were established in the United States and elsewhere.Although there were restrictions in Russia itself, the [[Latvia]] branch translated and printed Russian-language literature and the [[Estonia]] branch broadcast Russian-language radio lectures.]--> In 1935, the Watch Tower Society unsuccessfully attempted to establish a branch office in the [[Soviet Union]] to support members already there. By 1939, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were residing in the [[Baltic states]] when the Soviet Union absorbed those formerly independent countries. In the 1940s, the Soviet government forcibly dispersed thousands of Witnesses, in a program named [[Operation North]], later described by Dr. N. S. Gordienko, a professor at [[Herzen University]] as having ""just the opposite of what was expected; they wanted to weaken the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in the USSR, but in fact, they only strengthened it"". In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4,500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union. When the denomination was formally recognized in March 1991, the organization reported 15,987 members in Russia. Beginning in 1993, Witness missionaries from Germany were assigned to Russia to support the local members. By 2014, Jehovah's Witnesses reported over 170,000 members in Russia.<ref>{{cite book|title=2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=184}}</ref><!--Please provide secondary source(s) for this history-->

[Early Russian adherent Semyon Kozlitsky, a Russian Orthodox seminary graduate, associated personally with [[Charles Taze Russell]] as early as 1891 and was a member of the [[Bible Student movement]] in Russia, [[Siberia]], and what is now [[Kazakhstan]] until his death in 1935. In the 1920s, ''The Watch Tower'' was published in Russian, and Russian-language congregations were established in the United States and elsewhere.Although there were restrictions in Russia itself, the [[Latvia]] branch translated and printed Russian-language literature and the [[Estonia]] branch broadcast Russian-language radio lectures.]--> In 1935, the Watch Tower Society unsuccessfully attempted to establish a branch office in the [[Soviet Union]] to support members already there. By 1939, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were residing in the [[Baltic states]] when the Soviet Union absorbed those formerly independent countries. In the 1940s, the Soviet government forcibly dispersed thousands of Witnesses, in a program named [[Operation North]], later described by Dr. N. S. Gordienko, a professor at [[Herzen University]] as having ""just the opposite of what was expected; they wanted to weaken the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in the USSR, but in fact, they only strengthened it"". In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4,500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union. When the denomination was formally recognized in March 1991, the organization reported 15,987 members in Russia. Beginning in 1993, Witness missionaries from Germany were assigned to Russia to support the local members. By 2014, Jehovah's Witnesses reported over 170,000 members in Russia.<ref>{{cite book|title=2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=184}}</ref><!--Please provide secondary source(s) for this history-->

 ''Zion's Watch Tower'' (now called ''[[The Watchtower]]'', the primary journal of the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]]) had subscribers in Russia as early as 1887.<!--Reducing tangential historical detail based only on primary sources and lacking notability... [Early Russian adherent Semyon Kozlitsky, a Russian Orthodox seminary graduate, associated personally with [[Charles Taze Russell]] as early as 1891 and was a member of the [[Bible Student movement]] in Russia, [[Siberia]], and what is now [[Kazakhstan]] until his death in 1935. In the 1920s, ''The Watch Tower'' was published in Russian, and Russian-language congregations were established in the United States and elsewhere.Although there were restrictions in Russia itself, the [[Latvia]] branch translated and printed Russian-language literature and the [[Estonia]] branch broadcast Russian-language radio lectures.]--> In 1935, the Watch Tower Society unsuccessfully attempted to establish a branch office in the [[Soviet Union]] to support members already there. By 1939, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were residing in the [[Baltic states]] when the Soviet Union absorbed those formerly independent countries. In the 1940s, the Soviet government forcibly dispersed thousands of Witnesses, in a program named [[Operation North]], later described by Dr. N. S. Gordienko, a professor at [[Herzen University]] as having ""just the opposite of what was expected; they wanted to weaken the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in the USSR, but in fact, they only strengthened it"". In the 1950s and 1960s, Jehovah's Witnesses were tracked, infiltrated, harassed, and persecuted by the Soviet government. By 1971, there were more than 4,500 Witnesses in the Soviet Union. When the denomination was formally recognized in March 1991, the organization reported 15,987 members in Russia. Beginning in 1993, Witness missionaries from Germany were assigned to Russia to support the local members. By 2014, Jehovah's Witnesses reported over 170,000 members in Russia.<ref>{{cite book|title=2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=184}}</ref><!--Please provide secondary source(s) for this history-->
