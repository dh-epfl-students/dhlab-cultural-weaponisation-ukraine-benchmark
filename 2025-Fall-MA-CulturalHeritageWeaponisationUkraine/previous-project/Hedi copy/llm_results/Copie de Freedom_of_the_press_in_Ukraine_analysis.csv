The addition of this section could be seen as weaponised because it emphasizes Ukraine's struggles with press freedom and the implications of political changes, which may serve to frame the narrative around Ukraine's governance and its impact on cultural and media freedoms. The context of the comment by the user, which suggests a dismissive attitude towards Ukraine's claims of freedom, further indicates a potential bias in the portrayal of Ukraine's situation.",Weaponised

Weaponised

Justification: The addition of this sentence introduces a perspective that emphasizes the state of media freedom in Ukraine, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to criticisms of Ukrainian media practices. This framing can be used to support a specific political stance regarding Ukraine's governance and media landscape, potentially weaponizing the cultural narrative around freedom of expression in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.",Weaponised

+Amid tensions with Russia, Kiev is not tolerating any other points of view in the press. Under the impact of war and extreme social polarization, the democratic credentials of the pro-European Kiev government have been slipping as well. A crackdown on what authorities describe as “pro-separatist” points of view has triggered dismay among Western human rights monitors. For example, the September 11, 2014 shutdown of the independent Kiev-based Vesti newspaper by the Ukrainian Security Service for “violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity” brought swift condemnation from the international Committee to Protect Journalists and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.<ref name="":02"">{{Cite web|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2014/0921/Crackdown-in-Ukraine-sullies-its-democratic-aspirations|title = Crackdown in Ukraine sullies its democratic aspirations|date = September 21, 2014|accessdate = |website = The Christian Science Monitor|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

+ The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) broke into the office of a Kiev-based digital newspaper “Vesti”, physically trapping reporters and ultimately shutting down the website.
+
+Vesti News's editor-in-chief Igor Guzhva wrote on his Facebook page that the news outlet had been raided by SBU. The SBU reportedly took all servers, kept staffers in a ""hot corridor"" and shut down the website completely. Guzhva said that the purpose of the raid was ""to block our work."". “Journalists are not being let into their office,"" Guzhva wrote. ""Those who were already inside at the moment of the raid are being kept in the building and are not allowed to use cell phones.”
+
+Guzhva said that this is the second time in just six months that the SBU has tried to ""intimidate"" its editors. He added that he is unsure of the reason for the raid, but suspects that it might have to do with a story the website recently published on the SBU chief's daughter.<ref>{{Cite web|url = www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/11/ukraine-news-raid-vesti-kiev-website-media_n_5805642.html|title = Ukraine Security Services Break Into Newspaper Office, Shut Down Website|date = November 9, 2014|accessdate = |website = Huff Post Media|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

**Analysis:** The addition emphasizes Ukraine's proactive stance against perceived Russian propaganda and information warfare, framing the ministry's role as a defensive measure against external narratives. This aligns with a narrative that positions Ukraine as a victim of Russian aggression, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing national identity and the legitimacy of state actions in the context of conflict.

 Amid tensions with Russia, Kiev is not tolerating any other points of view in the press. Under the impact of war and extreme social polarization, the democratic credentials of the pro-European Kiev government have been slipping as well. A crackdown on what authorities describe as “pro-separatist” points of view has triggered dismay among Western human rights monitors. For example, the September 11, 2014 shutdown of the independent Kiev-based Vesti newspaper by the Ukrainian Security Service for “violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity” brought swift condemnation from the international Committee to Protect Journalists and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.<ref name="":02"">{{Cite web|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2014/0921/Crackdown-in-Ukraine-sullies-its-democratic-aspirations|title = Crackdown in Ukraine sullies its democratic aspirations|date = September 21, 2014|accessdate = |website = The Christian Science Monitor|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

 The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has resulted in a major threat to press freedom in recent months.

 For example, the September 11, 2014 shutdown of the independent Kiev-based Vesti newspaper by the Ukrainian Security Service for “violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity” brought swift condemnation from the international Committee to Protect Journalists and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.<ref name="":02"">{{cite web|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2014/0921/Crackdown-in-Ukraine-sullies-its-democratic-aspirations|title = Crackdown in Ukraine sullies its democratic aspirations|date = September 21, 2014|accessdate = |website = The Christian Science Monitor|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) broke into the office of a Kiev-based digital newspaper “Vesti”, physically trapping reporters and ultimately shutting down the website.  Vesti News's editor-in-chief Igor Guzhva wrote on his Facebook page that the news outlet had been raided by SBU. The SBU reportedly took all servers, kept staffers in a ""hot corridor"" and shut down the website completely. Guzhva said that the purpose of the raid was ""to block our work."". “Journalists are not being let into their office,"" Guzhva wrote. ""Those who were already inside at the moment of the raid are being kept in the building and are not allowed to use cell phones.” Guzhva said that this is the second time in just six months that the SBU has tried to ""intimidate"" its editors. He added that he is unsure of the reason for the raid, but suspects that it might have to do with a story the website recently published on the SBU chief's daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/11/ukraine-news-raid-vesti-kiev-website-media_n_5805642.html|title = Ukraine Security Services Break Into Newspaper Office, Shut Down Website|date = November 9, 2014|accessdate = |website = Huff Post Media|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

Vesti News's editor-in-chief Igor Guzhva wrote on his Facebook page that the news outlet had been raided by SBU. The SBU reportedly took all servers, kept staffers in a ""hot corridor"" and shut down the website completely. Guzhva said that the purpose of the raid was ""to block our work."". “Journalists are not being let into their office,"" Guzhva wrote. ""Those who were already inside at the moment of the raid are being kept in the building and are not allowed to use cell phones.” Guzhva said that this is the second time in just six months that the SBU has tried to ""intimidate"" its editors.

+<blockquote>due to profound changes in the media environment after the fall of President Viktor Yanukovych’s government in February, despite a rise in attacks on journalists during the Euromaidan protests of early 2014 and the subsequent conflict in eastern Ukraine. The level of government hostility and legal pressure faced by journalists decreased, as did political pressure on state-owned outlets. The media also benefited from improvements to the law on access to information and the increased independence of the broadcasting regulator.</blockquote>

 ",,Davide Denti (OBC),2016-02-24T15:11:39Z,"The change made was ""Rephrased 'Freedom of the press in Ukraine' to 'Media freedom in Ukraine' and added context regarding the improvement of press freedom in Ukraine since 2015, including specific incidents of violence against journalists and the impact of the Russian occupation on media freedom.""

Notably, the revision includes terms like ""Russian occupation of Crimea"" and ""war in Donbass,"" which are sensitive and politically charged phrases that can be seen as weaponising cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes conflict and oppression.

**Weaponised** - The inclusion of terms related to the Russian occupation and the war in Donbass suggests a narrative that could be used to frame the situation in Ukraine in a way that emphasizes victimhood and external aggression, which can be seen as a form of cultural and political weaponisation.",Weaponised

The level of government hostility and legal pressure faced by journalists decreased, as did political pressure on state-owned outlets. The media also benefited from improvements to the law on access to information and the increased independence of the broadcasting regulator.</blockquote>

 '''Transparency of media ownership''' refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures. A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes possible for the public as well as for media authorities to find out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies.
 
-The lack of transparency on media ownership has typically been a negative trait of the Ukrainian media system.

 == Situation in the Russian-annexed Crimea ==
 
 The media environment in [[Crimea]] was completely transformed by the March 2014 Russian [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] of the peninsula, after the ejection of [[Viktor Yanukovych]] from power in [[Ukraine]] following the [[euromaidan]] protests. Russian authorities engineered an annexation referendum to Russia, and restrictive Russian media laws started to be enacted in the Black Sea peninsula too. Media conditions in Crimea in 2014 were worse than in [[Russia]] itself, due to the effort of Russia-imposed authorities to rein in a previously relatively pluralistic media landscape. Media outlets were shut down, broadcasts of Ukrainian channels were suspended, and journalists fled the region due to fears of harassment, violence, and arrests. The situation of press freedom in Crimea in 2014 was identified by [[Freedom House]] as the worst in the European continent.<ref name=FHcrimea>[[Freedom House]], [https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/crimea Crimea 2015 Press Freedom] report</ref>",+Self-censorship,Niccolò Caranti (OBC),2017-05-15T13:12:31Z,"Added a section titled ""Self-censorship"" that discusses tendencies toward self-censorship in Ukraine's media landscape, including influences from media owners and government pressures.

 Specifically, the new law amends article 12 of the existing Law of Ukraine on Television and Radio Broadcasting of 1994, establishing that national and local government authorities, individuals and legal entities which are registered offline, political parties, religious organisations, professional unions, and persons that were convicted by courts and that are still serving their sentences cannot be owners of a TV or radio stations in Ukraine.

 Political interference in the media sector greatly diminished after the flight of [[Yanukovych]] from Ukraine, with media outlets almost immediately starting to openly discuss the events of the previous months, including the moments of violence, which had previously been censored or self-censored through pressures on owners and managers.

 <blockquote>due to profound changes in the media environment after the fall of President Viktor Yanukovych’s government in February, despite a rise in attacks on journalists during the Euromaidan protests of early 2014 and the subsequent conflict in eastern Ukraine. The level of government hostility and legal pressure faced by journalists decreased, as did political pressure on state-owned outlets. The media also benefited from improvements to the law on access to information and the increased independence of the broadcasting regulator.</blockquote>

 == Situation in the Russian-annexed Crimea ==
 
 The media environment in [[Crimea]] was completely transformed by the March 2014 Russian [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] of the peninsula, after the ejection of [[Viktor Yanukovych]] from power in [[Ukraine]] following the [[euromaidan]] protests. Russian authorities engineered an annexation referendum to Russia, and restrictive Russian media laws started to be enacted in the Black Sea peninsula too. Media conditions in Crimea in 2014 were worse than in [[Russia]] itself, due to the effort of Russia-imposed authorities to rein in a previously relatively pluralistic media landscape. Media outlets were shut down, broadcasts of Ukrainian channels were suspended, and journalists fled the region due to fears of harassment, violence, and arrests. The situation of press freedom in Crimea in 2014 was identified by [[Freedom House]] as the worst in the European continent.<ref name=FHcrimea>[[Freedom House]], [https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/crimea Crimea 2015 Press Freedom] report</ref>",/* Self-censorship */ how about some Situation in Ukraine?,Emijrp,2017-06-15T07:57:10Z,"Added a section titled ""Situation in Ukraine"" with details about the denial of entry to Russian journalists by Ukraine's border officers.

The level of government hostility and legal pressure faced by journalists decreased, as did political pressure on state-owned outlets. The media also benefited from improvements to the law on access to information and the increased independence of the broadcasting regulator.</blockquote>

 <blockquote>due to profound changes in the media environment after the fall of President Viktor Yanukovych’s government in February, despite a rise in attacks on journalists during the Euromaidan protests of early 2014 and the subsequent conflict in eastern Ukraine. The level of government hostility and legal pressure faced by journalists decreased, as did political pressure on state-owned outlets. The media also benefited from improvements to the law on access to information and the increased independence of the broadcasting regulator.</blockquote>
 In 2015 the main concerns about media freedom in Ukraine concern the handling of pro-Russian propaganda, the concentration of media ownership, and the high risks of violence against journalists, especially in the conflict areas in the east.<ref name=FH/>

 == Situation in the Russian-annexed Crimea ==
 
 The media environment in [[Crimea]] was completely transformed by the March 2014 Russian [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] of the peninsula, after the ejection of [[Viktor Yanukovych]] from power in [[Ukraine]] following the [[euromaidan]] protests. Russian authorities engineered an annexation referendum to Russia, and restrictive Russian media laws started to be enacted in the Black Sea peninsula too. Media conditions in Crimea in 2014 were worse than in [[Russia]] itself, due to the effort of Russia-imposed authorities to rein in a previously relatively pluralistic media landscape. Media outlets were shut down, broadcasts of Ukrainian channels were suspended, and journalists fled the region due to fears of harassment, violence, and arrests. The situation of press freedom in Crimea in 2014 was identified by [[Freedom House]] as the worst in the European continent.<ref name=FHcrimea>[[Freedom House]], [https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/crimea Crimea 2015 Press Freedom] report</ref>",Reverted 3 edits by [[Special:Contributions/Emijrp|Emijrp]] ([[User talk:Emijrp|talk]]): Rv per [[WP:SYNTH]] and [[WP:GEVAL]].

The media also benefited from improvements to the law on access to information and the increased independence of the broadcasting regulator.</blockquote>

 In 2014 restrictions to press freedom in Ukraine included police impeding access to public buildings, physical attacks on press rooms, and cyberattacks (e.g. against the ''Glavnoe'', ''Gordon'' and [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]] websites); in July 2014 a firebomb was thrown at the TV channel ''[[112 Ukraine]]''.<ref name=""FH"" />
 
 Political interference in the media sector greatly diminished after the flight of [[Yanukovych]] from Ukraine, with media outlets almost immediately starting to openly discuss the events of the previous months, including the moments of violence, which had previously been censored or self-censored through pressures on owners and managers. The [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2014]] was covered with a wide variety of political orientations in the media.<ref name=""FH"" /> Minor cases of pressures or censorship attempts were reported in 2014 too.

The addition of ""weasel word"" and ""cn"" (citation needed) suggests an attempt to undermine the credibility of the statement regarding the dangers faced by journalists in Ukraine. This could be interpreted as an effort to downplay or question the severity of the situation, which aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize concerns about media freedom and safety in the context of the conflict.",Weaponised

 '''Transparency of media ownership''' refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures. A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes possible for the public as well as for media authorities to find out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies.

 In 2014 restrictions to press freedom in Ukraine included police impeding access to public buildings, physical attacks on press rooms, and cyberattacks (e.g. against the ''Glavnoe'', ''Gordon'' and [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]] websites); in July 2014 a firebomb was thrown at the TV channel ''[[112 Ukraine]]''.<ref name=""FH"" />
 
 Political interference in the media sector greatly diminished after the flight of [[Yanukovych]] from Ukraine, with media outlets almost immediately starting to openly discuss the events of the previous months, including the moments of violence, which had previously been censored or self-censored through pressures on owners and managers.

 Specifically, the new law amends article 12 of the existing Law of Ukraine on Television and Radio Broadcasting of 1994, establishing that national and local government authorities, individuals and legal entities which are registered offline, political parties, religious organisations, professional unions, and persons that were convicted by courts and that are still serving their sentences cannot be owners of a TV or radio stations in Ukraine. Furthermore, the Law prohibits to physical or legal persons residing in a country which is recognised as an aggressor or occupier the right to own a television or a radio station in Ukraine.<ref name=LOC/> This sentence refers to the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] which [[2014 Crimean status referendum|annexed Crimea]] in 2014.<ref name=LOC/> The Law provides a new definition of ownership which is closely connected to the exercise of a decisive influence in the management or business activity of the media outlet directly or through other persons and includes also [[final beneficiaries]].<ref name=LOC/> The Law requires that information on the ownership structure and on the individuals owning at least 10% or more of a television or radio broadcasting have to be made public on the company's website and sent to the [[National Council for Questions of Television and Radio Broadcasting]], which is the national media regulator in Ukraine. According to the Law, the Council can impose fines when information provided are insufficient or incorrect.<ref name=LOC/>
 
 According to some experts, one of the main weakness of the new law is that it does not exclude funding from financial sources located in [[Cyprus]] (even if it prohibits the transfer of funds from offshore territories), through which ownership of most Ukrainian TV channels is exercised. Among some commentators there are some doubts that the Law will be amended to address this issue, due to the strong lobbying efforts of TV owners.<ref name=LOC/> Other doubts have been voiced due to the lack of an effective sanctions system.<ref name=""MOM"" />

 According to some experts, one of the main weakness of the new law is that it does not exclude funding from financial sources located in [[Cyprus]] (even if it prohibits the transfer of funds from offshore territories), through which ownership of most Ukrainian TV channels is exercised. Among some commentators there are some doubts that the Law will be amended to address this issue, due to the strong lobbying efforts of TV owners.<ref name=LOC/> Other doubts have been voiced due to the lack of an effective sanctions system.<ref name=""MOM"" />

 In 2014 restrictions to press freedom in Ukraine included police impeding access to public buildings, physical attacks on press rooms, and cyberattacks (e.g. against the ''Glavnoe'', ''Gordon'' and [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]] websites); in July 2014 a firebomb was thrown at the TV channel ''[[112 Ukraine]]''.<ref name=""FH"" />

 In 2014 restrictions to press freedom in Ukraine included police impeding access to public buildings, physical attacks on press rooms, and cyberattacks (e.g. against the ''Glavnoe'', ''Gordon'' and [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]] websites); in July 2014 a firebomb was thrown at the TV channel ''[[112 Ukraine]]''.<ref name=""FH"" />
 
 Political interference in the media sector greatly diminished after the flight of [[Yanukovych]] from Ukraine, with media outlets almost immediately starting to openly discuss the events of the previous months, including the moments of violence, which had previously been censored or self-censored through pressures on owners and managers. The [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] was covered with a wide variety of political orientations in the media.<ref name=""FH"" /> Minor cases of pressures or censorship attempts were reported in 2014 too.

 <blockquote>due to profound changes in the media environment after the fall of President Viktor Yanukovych’s government in February, despite a rise in attacks on journalists during the Euromaidan protests of early 2014 and the subsequent conflict in eastern Ukraine. The level of government hostility and legal pressure faced by journalists decreased, as did political pressure on state-owned outlets. The media also benefited from improvements to the law on access to information and the increased independence of the broadcasting regulator.</blockquote>

 A May 2014 report from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] found approximately 300 instances of perceived violent attacks on the media in Ukraine since November 2013.<ref name="":0"">{{cite web|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-media-idUSBREA4M0IB20140523|title = Ukraine media freedom under attack: OSCE|date = 23 May 2014|website = Reuters}}</ref> The Ukrainian NGO [[Institute of Mass Information]] recorded at least 995 violations of free speech in 2014 - the double than in 2013 (496) and triple than in 2012 (324). Most attacks on journalists happened during the [[euromaidan]] period in Kyiv (82 in January, 70 in February 2014). 78 journalists were abducted and illegally detained by various groups in 2014 - a new category of professional risk; 20 such cases happened in Donetsk in April 2014. 
 In 2014 restrictions to press freedom in Ukraine included police impeding access to public buildings, physical attacks on press rooms, and cyberattacks (e.g. against the ''Glavnoe'', ''Gordon'' and [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]] websites); in July 2014 a firebomb was thrown at the TV channel ''[[112 Ukraine]]''.<ref name=""FH"" />
 
 Political interference in the media sector greatly diminished after the flight of [[Yanukovych]] from Ukraine, with media outlets almost immediately starting to openly discuss the events of the previous months, including the moments of violence, which had previously been censored or self-censored through pressures on owners and managers. The [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] was covered with a wide variety of political orientations in the media.<ref name=""FH"" /> Minor cases of pressures or censorship attempts were reported in 2014 too.

 In January 2018, the Russian version of British historian [[Antony Beevor]]'s ''[[Stalingrad (Beevor book)|Stalingrad]]'' was added to this list. The head of the committee, Serhiy Oliyinyk, told [[Radio Free Europe]] that one particular reason was that Beevor had included information about Ukrainian militia killing 90 Jewish children on orders of the SS ""to save the feelings of the [[Sonderkommando]]."" He claimed this had never been confirmed at post-war trials and was taken from Soviet sources. Beevor strongly criticized the ban and said the source was actually German resistance fighter [[Helmuth Groscurth]].<ref>[https://www.rferl.org/a/beevor-historian-ukraine-ban-stalingrad/28980932.html Historian Beevor 'Astonished' At Ukraine Ban On Best-Selling 'Stalingrad'], Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty</ref> ""It’s utterly outrageous.

 The media environment in [[Crimea]] was completely transformed by the March 2014 Russian [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] of the peninsula, after the ejection of [[Viktor Yanukovych]] from power in [[Ukraine]] following the [[euromaidan]] protests. Russian authorities engineered an annexation referendum to Russia, and restrictive Russian media laws started to be enacted in the Black Sea peninsula too. Media conditions in Crimea in 2014 were worse than in [[Russia]] itself, due to the effort of Russia-imposed authorities to rein in a previously relatively pluralistic media landscape. Media outlets were shut down, broadcasts of Ukrainian channels were suspended, and journalists fled the region due to fears of harassment, violence, and arrests. The situation of press freedom in Crimea in 2014 was identified by [[Freedom House]] as the worst in the European continent.<ref name=FHcrimea>[[Freedom House]], [https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/crimea Crimea 2015 Press Freedom] report</ref>

 According to some experts, one of the main weakness of the new law is that it does not exclude funding from financial sources located in [[Cyprus]] (even if it prohibits the transfer of funds from offshore territories), through which ownership of most Ukrainian TV channels is exercised.

 In 2014 restrictions to press freedom in Ukraine included police impeding access to public buildings, physical attacks on press rooms, and cyberattacks (e.g. against the ''Glavnoe'', ''Gordon'' and [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]] websites); in July 2014 a firebomb was thrown at the TV channel ''[[112 Ukraine]]''.<ref name=""FH"" />
 
 Political interference in the media sector greatly diminished after the flight of [[Yanukovych]] from Ukraine, with media outlets almost immediately starting to openly discuss the events of the previous months, including the moments of violence, which had previously been censored or self-censored through pressures on owners and managers.

 According to some experts, one of the main weakness of the new law is that it does not exclude funding from financial sources located in [[Cyprus]] (even if it prohibits the transfer of funds from offshore territories), through which ownership of most Ukrainian TV channels is exercised. Among some commentators there are some doubts that the Law will be amended to address this issue, due to the strong lobbying efforts of TV owners.<ref name=LOC/> Other doubts have been voiced due to the lack of an effective sanctions system.<ref name=""MOM"" />

**Added**: Text discussing the pluralism and independence of Ukrainian media post-Orange Revolution, the cessation of tax inspections limiting press freedom, and the overall assessment of press freedom in Ukraine.

**Weaponised**: The content reflects a narrative that emphasizes the positive developments in Ukrainian media freedom following the Orange Revolution, which can be seen as a counter-narrative to Russian claims of media oppression. This framing can be used to bolster Ukraine's cultural and political identity against perceived external threats, thus potentially weaponizing the narrative of media freedom in the context of the ongoing conflict with Russia.",Weaponised

 In 2014 restrictions to press freedom in Ukraine included police impeding access to public buildings, physical attacks on press rooms, and cyberattacks (e.g. against the ''Glavnoe'', ''Gordon'' and [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]] websites); in July 2014 a firebomb was thrown at the TV channel ''[[112 Ukraine]]''.<ref name=""FH"" />
 
 Political interference in the media sector greatly diminished after the flight of [[Yanukovych]] from Ukraine, with media outlets almost immediately starting to openly discuss the events of the previous months, including the moments of violence, which had previously been censored or self-censored through pressures on owners and managers. The [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] was covered with a wide variety of political orientations in the media.<ref name=""FH"" /> Minor cases of pressures or censorship attempts were reported in 2014 too.

 <blockquote>due to profound changes in the media environment after the fall of President Viktor Yanukovych's government in February, despite a rise in attacks on journalists during the Euromaidan protests of early 2014 and the subsequent conflict in eastern Ukraine.

**Analysis:** The content remains focused on the Ukrainian government's actions regarding media and information policy, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict with Russia.

**Analysis:** The revision maintains a focus on the Ministry of Information Policy and its role in regulating media, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Ukraine's ongoing conflict with Russia. The changes do not introduce overtly weaponized language but rather update references and clarify the ministry's purpose. However, the context of media regulation in a conflict zone can be interpreted as a means of controlling narratives, which may have implications for cultural heritage and freedom of expression.

**Conclusion:** Not Weaponised – The changes are primarily administrative and do not introduce weaponized language or narratives.",Not Weaponised

 ","/* Russian invasion and Zelensky presidency (2019-present) */ Gonzalo Lira is no longer ""living in Ukraine""",TurboSuperA+,2025-04-14T15:48:05Z,"The change made in this revision is the removal of the phrase ""living in Ukraine"" in reference to Gonzalo Lira, and the addition of the phrase ""who died in custody"" to describe him.

**Change Description:** Removed ""living in Ukraine"" and added ""who died in custody"".

**Analysis:** The revision shifts the narrative surrounding Gonzalo Lira from a neutral description of his status to a more charged statement that implies a tragic outcome and potential victimization. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to frame Lira's situation in a way that elicits sympathy and highlights perceived injustices, which can be a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by invoking themes of oppression and martyrdom.

**Conclusion:** Weaponised. The language shift emphasizes victimhood and could be used to manipulate perceptions regarding the treatment of individuals in the context of the conflict.",Weaponised
