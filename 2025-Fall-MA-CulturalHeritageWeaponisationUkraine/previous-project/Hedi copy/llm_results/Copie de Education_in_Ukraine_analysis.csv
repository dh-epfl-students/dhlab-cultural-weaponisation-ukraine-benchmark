==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==
*[[National Technical University of Ukraine]]
*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:  
*""12"" = ""5+""
*""11"" = ""5""
*""10"" = ""5-""

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education.

Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:

""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the ''[[Kandidat nauk|Kandidat Nauk]]'' degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}, Candidate of Sciences). The seeker should pass three exams (in his/her special field, in a foreign language of his/her choice and in philosophy), publish at least three scientific articles, write a [[dissertation]] and defend it.

+
+After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Few (2 to 4) years of study in ''doctorantura'' ({{lang|ru|докторантура}}) with obtaining important scientific results, publishing them and writing new thesis would result in the ''Doctor Nauk'' degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}, Doctor of Sciences), but the typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''Kandidat'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only 1 of 4 ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.

+''Kandidat Nauk'' may keep position of Assistant Professor (''Docent'') in universities and of Researcher or Senior Researcher in a scientific institutes. ''Doctor Nauk'' can hold position of full Professor, Head of Laboratory or equal and higher ones.

And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

+==Language of education==
+After independence, a significant change in the language of instruction in educational institutions took place. According to the Razumkov centre, 49% of high school students in 1991/92 were receiving their education in Ukrainian, and 50% in Russian. In 2000/01, however, 70% of students attended Ukrainian schools (where Ukrainian is the primary language of instruction) while 29% were studying in Russian schools (both languages are studied in all schools in Ukraine, as part of the curriculum). This trend is opposite to the changes in the 1970s and 1980s, when the number of Russian schools was constantly being increased. The transition toward Ukrainian-language usage is taking a long time, and in some schools that had switched to Ukrainian from Russian, part or most of the instruction is still given in Russian.

+In general, most of the population in Ukraine is bilingual, at least to some degree. Most of the [[Ukrainophone]] population is also fluent in Russian and many Russian native speakers in Ukraine are fluent in Ukrainian as well.

Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:

Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

In case of all 5 grades, the scholarship is increased by 25% (""povyshena stipedia""). For most students the amount of government scholarship is not sufficient to cover their minimal living expenses. Most Universities provide subsidized housing for out-of-city students. Also, it's common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students.

It was the only degree awarded by Universities in the Soviet times.
 
 ===Postgraduate level===
-After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a university or a scientific institute to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the ''[[Kandidat nauk|Kandidat Nauk]]'' degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}, Candidate of Sciences). The candidate must pass three exams in the field of specialty, in a foreign language of his/her choice and in philosophy; publish at least three scientific articles, write a [[dissertation]] and defend it.

-After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura'' ({{lang|ru|докторантура}}). Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doctor Nauk]]'' degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}, Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''Kandidat'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 Historically, the language of instruction has often been changed in Ukraine. In the times of the [[Russian Empire]], the Ukrainian language was proscribed, and Russian language predominated among elite, which had access to schools. The initial policies of the [[Bolsheviks]] were supportive of local languages, and many Ukrainian-language schools were opened, with the long-term goal of getting rid of illiteracy. From the mid-1930s to the mid-1980s, the Soviet government policies favored [[Russification]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, the number of Russian schools was constantly being increased at the expense of Ukrainian schools. In 1991/92, according to the Razumkov centre, 49% of high school students were receiving their education in Ukrainian, and 50% in Russian. After independence the trend was reversed. However, reintroduction of formal Ukrainian-language study has taken longer than expected. In some schools that had tried to switch to Ukrainian from Russian, part or most of the instruction is still given in Russian.

 There are two degrees conferred by Ukrainian universities: the Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years) and the Master's Degree (5-6&nbsp;years). These degrees are introduced in accordance with [[Bologna process]], in which Ukraine is taking part. Historically, Specialist's Degree (usually 5 years) was also granted. It was the only degree awarded by Universities in the Soviet times.
 
 ===Postgraduate level===
-After obtaining a Master's Degree, a student may enter a university or a scientific institute to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''Aspirantura'' that usually results in the ''[[Kandidat nauk|Kandidat Nauk]]'' degree (Candidate of Sciences). Candidates must pass three qualifying exams (in the field of specialty, in a foreign language of their choice and in philosophy), publish at least three scientific articles, write a [[dissertation]] and defend it. This degree is roughly equivalent to the [[Ph.D.]] in the United States.

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''Doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a [[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]] degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''Kandidat'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

The initial policies of [[Bolsheviks]] were in support of local languages, and many Ukrainian schools were opened, with the long-term goal of getting rid of illiteracy completely. Since mid-1930s, over the next 50 years, the Soviet government policies were toward Russification. In the 1970s and 1980s, the number of Russian schools was constantly being increased at expense of Ukrainian schools. In 1991/92, according to the Razumkov centre, 49% of high school students were receiving their education in Ukrainian, and 50% in Russian. After independence the trend has been reverted. However, Ukrainian-language usage is taking a long time, and in some schools that had switched to Ukrainian from Russian, part or most of the instruction is still given in Russian.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

The initial policies of [[Bolsheviks]] were in support of local languages, and many Ukrainian schools were opened, with the long-term goal of getting rid of illiteracy completely. Since mid-1930s, over the next 50 years, the Soviet government policies were toward Russification. In the 1970s and 1980s, the number of Russian schools was constantly being increased at expense of Ukrainian schools.

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a [[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]] degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis.

 There are two degrees conferred by Ukrainian universities: the Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years) and the Master's Degree (5-6&nbsp;years).

-After obtaining a Master's or Specialist's Degree, a student may enter a university or a scientific institute to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''Aspirantura'' that usually results in the ''[[Kandidat nauk|Kandidat Nauk]]'' degree (Candidate of Sciences). Candidates must pass three qualifying exams (in the field of specialty, in a foreign language of their choice and in philosophy), publish at least three scientific articles, write a [[dissertation]] and defend it.

Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

This degree is roughly equivalent to the [[Ph.D.]] in the United States.<ref name=""GSE"">{{cite book|title=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]].|publisher=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya|edition=3rd ed.|pages=vol. 11|location=Moscow|language=Russian}}</ref>. 
 
-After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a [[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]] degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''Kandidat'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.

Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

+The Ukrainian educational system is arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education.
 
 ===School level===
 Primary and secondary education is divided into into ""younger"", ""middle"" and ""senior"" schools. Younger school comprises grades 1 to 4. Grades 5-9 are usually referred to as ""middle school"", while 10-11 are ""senior school"". Despite the names, students usually study in the same school building throughout their primary and secondary education.

 Higher education can be obtained either at the expense of the state or for a fee. It is common practice that university candidates are not required to pass an entrance examination if they are willing to pay for their education.<ref>Sometimes there are some exams for the paying candidate but, as a rule, they are a formality only.</ref>
 
-Students that study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term exams and differentiated test is at least 4 (see the 5-point grade system below); this rule may be somewhat changed in some universities. In the case of all 5 grades, the scholarship is increased by 25%. For most students the amount of government scholarship is not sufficient to cover their minimal living expenses. Most universities provide subsidized housing for out-of-city students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students.

Most universities provide subsidized housing for out-of-city students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students.
 
 There are two degrees conferred by Ukrainian universities: the Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years) and the Master's Degree (5-6&nbsp;years). These degrees are introduced in accordance with [[Bologna process]], in which Ukraine is taking part. Historically, Specialist's Degree (usually 5 years) is still also granted; it was the only degree awarded by universities in the Soviet times.
 
 ===Postgraduate level===
-After obtaining the Master's Degree or the Specialist's one, a student may enter a university or a scientific institute to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' that usually results in the ''[[Kandidat nauk|Kandidat Nauk]]'' degree (Candidate of Sciences). Candidates must pass three qualifying exams (in the field of specialty, in a foreign language of their choice and in philosophy), publish at least three scientific articles, write a [[dissertation]] and defend it. This degree is roughly equivalent to the [[Ph.D.]] in the United States.<ref name=""GSE"">{{cite book|title=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]].|publisher=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya|edition=3rd ed.|pages=vol. 11|location=Moscow|language=Russian}}</ref>.

-After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''Kandidat'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.

Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education.

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''Kandidat'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education.

A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 Upon obtaining a Master's Degree or Specialist, a student may enter a university or a scientific institute to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' that usually results in the ''[[Kandidat nauk|Kandidat Nauk]]'' degree (Candidate of Sciences). Candidates must pass three qualifying exams (in the field of specialty, in a foreign language of their choice and in philosophy), publish at least three scientific articles, write a [[dissertation]] and defend it.

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old.

And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 Upon obtaining a Master's Degree or Specialist, a student may enter a university or a scientific institute to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' that usually results in the ''[[Kandidat nauk|Kandidat Nauk]]'' degree (Candidate of Sciences). Candidates must pass three qualifying exams (in the field of specialty, in a foreign language of their choice and in philosophy), publish at least three scientific articles, write a [[dissertation]] and defend it.

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old.

There are schools with instruction in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Polish language|Polish]] in regions populated by those groups.
 Historically, the language of instruction has often changed in Ukraine. When Ukraine was part of the [[Russian Empire]], the Ukrainian language was proscribed, and Russian predominated among the elite, who had access to schools.
 The initial policies of the [[Bolsheviks]] were supportive of local languages, and many Ukrainian-language schools were opened, with the long-term goal of getting rid of illiteracy. From the mid-1930s to the mid-1980s, the Soviet government policies favoured [[Russification]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, the number of Russian-language schools constantly increased at the expense of Ukrainian-language schools. After Ukraine obtaining independence the trend was reversed. However, reintroduction of formal Ukrainian-language study has taken longer than expected. In some schools that has tried to switch to Ukrainian, part or most of the instruction is still given in Russian.

And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}).

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education.

Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 Students that study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term exams and differentiated test is at least 4 (see the 5-point grade system below); this rule may be different in some universities. In the case of all students with a grade 5, the scholarship is increased by 25%. For most students the level of government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic living expenses.

Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==

*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education.

Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:

As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99.

 Upon obtaining a Master's Degree or Specialist, a student may enter a university or a scientific institute to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' that usually results in the ''[[Kandidat nauk|Kandidat Nauk]]'' degree (Candidate of Sciences). Candidates must pass three qualifying exams (in the field of specialty, in a foreign language of their choice and in philosophy), publish at least three scientific articles, write a [[dissertation]] and defend it. This degree is roughly equivalent to the [[Ph.D.]] in the United States.<ref name=""GSE"">{{cite book|title=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]].|publisher=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya|edition=3rd|location=Moscow|language=Russian|nopp=true|page=Vol. 11}}</ref>.
 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.
 ''Kandidat Nauk'' may keep the position Associate Professor in universities, or Researcher/Senior Researcher in scientific institutes. ''Doctor Nauk'' can hold position of full Professor, Head of Laboratory or an equal/higher positions.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

-Upon obtaining a Master's Degree or Specialist, a student may enter a university or a scientific institute to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' that usually results in the ''[[Kandidat nauk|Kandidat Nauk]]'' degree (Candidate of Sciences). Candidates must pass three qualifying exams (in the field of specialty, in a foreign language of their choice and in philosophy), publish at least three scientific articles, write a [[dissertation]] and defend it.

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.
 ''Kandidat Nauk'' may keep the position Associate Professor in universities, or Researcher/Senior Researcher in scientific institutes. ''Doctor Nauk'' can hold position of full Professor, Head of Laboratory or an equal/higher positions.
 The Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science is considering changing the Soviet style ''Kandidat Nauk'' and ''Doctor Nauk'' degrees to Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor Habilitation, as has happened in several other post-Soviet countries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}","[[WP:CHECKWIKI]] error fixes + [[WP:GENFIXES|general fixes]], References after punctuation per [[WP:REFPUNC]] and [[WP:PAIC]] using [[Project:AWB|AWB]] (7507)",Yobot,2010-12-26T10:27:20Z,"The change made in this revision is a rephrasing of sentences for clarity and punctuation adjustments.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99.

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education.

And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99.

Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

 In 2000/01 [[academic year]], 70% of students attended Ukrainian-language schools (that is where [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is the primary language of instruction), while 29% were studying in [[Russian language|Russian-language]] schools. There are schools with instruction in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Polish language|Polish]] in regions populated by those groups.
 Historically, the language of instruction has often changed in Ukraine. When Ukraine was part of the [[Russian Empire]], the Ukrainian language was proscribed, and Russian predominated among the elite, who had access to schools.
-The initial policies of the [[Bolsheviks]] were supportive of local languages, and many Ukrainian-language schools were opened, with the long-term goal of getting rid of illiteracy. From the mid-1930s to the mid-1980s, the Soviet government policies favoured [[Russification]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, the number of Russian-language schools constantly increased at the expense of Ukrainian-language schools. After Ukraine obtaining independence the trend was reversed. However, reintroduction of formal Ukrainian-language study has taken longer than expected. In some schools that has tried to switch to Ukrainian, part or most of the instruction is still given in Russian.

Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education.

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}).

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.
 ''Kandidat Nauk'' may keep the position Associate Professor in universities, or Researcher/Senior Researcher in scientific institutes. ''Doctor Nauk'' can hold position of full Professor, Head of Laboratory or an equal/higher positions.
 The Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science is considering changing the Soviet style ''Kandidat Nauk'' and ''Doctor Nauk'' degrees to Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor Habilitation, as has happened in several other post-Soviet countries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}",proper spelling of the word in Ukrainian (& it's latinization),BezosibnyjUA,2013-04-04T02:27:19Z,"Changed ""Kandidat Nauk"" to ""Kandydat Nauk"" for proper spelling in Ukrainian.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 The initial policies of the [[Bolsheviks]] were supportive of local languages, and many Ukrainian-language schools were opened, with the long-term goal of getting rid of illiteracy. From the mid-1930s to the mid-1980s, the Soviet government policies favoured [[Russification]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, the number of Russian-language schools constantly increased at the expense of Ukrainian-language schools. After Ukraine obtaining independence the trend was reversed. However, reintroduction of formal Ukrainian-language study has taken longer than expected. In some schools that have tried to switch to Ukrainian, part or most of the instruction is still given in Russian.
 In universities there are similar trends. In 1991/92 [[academic year]], according to the [[Razumkov Centre]], 49% of high school students were receiving their education in Ukrainian, and 50% in Russian.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

**User Context:** The user is identified by an IP address, which does not provide specific insight into their motivations or affiliations.

**Analysis:** The removal of multiple links that provide educational resources and information about Ukraine, alongside the addition of a single link, could suggest a shift in focus or an attempt to streamline the information presented. However, the nature of the removed links does not inherently carry weaponised language or narratives.

==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==
*[[National Technical University of Ukraine]]
*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 Since 2006 (and even earlier in some universities), university students are graded on a rating scale of 0 to 100. These grades can be transformed to the 5-point scale approximately as follows (this system may vary a little from university to university and may change from time to time):
-*from 90 to 100 means ""5""

 Both the rating scale and the 5-point scale are used in university registers. Some lecturers prefer to use A-F-point scale to rate students during their passing the exams.
 
 As for secondary schools, they also used the above-mentioned 5-point scale till 2000.

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 {{Main|Higher education in Ukraine}}
 [[Higher education in Ukraine|Higher education]] is either state funded or private. Students that study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term exams and differentiated test is at least 4 (see the 5-point grade system below); this rule may be different in some universities. In the case of all grades being the highest (5), the scholarship is increased by 25%. For most students the level of government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic living expenses. Most universities provide subsidized housing for out-of-city students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students.
 There are two degrees conferred by Ukrainian universities: the Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years) and the Master's Degree (5–6th&nbsp;year). These degrees are introduced in accordance with [[Bologna process]], in which Ukraine is taking part.

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 Primary and secondary education is divided into three levels of accreditation of general education: I - ""younger"", II - ""middle"", and III - ""senior"". I level of accreditation comprises grades 1 to 4. Grades 5-9 are usually considered a II level of accreditation or a base secondary education, while 10-11 are a III level. Despite the names, students usually study in the same school institution throughout their primary and secondary education. [[Primary school]]ing lasts 4 years and [[middle school]] 5.

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.
 ''Kandidat Nauk'' may keep the position Associate Professor in universities, or Researcher/Senior Researcher in scientific institutes. ''Doctor Nauk'' can hold position of full Professor, Head of Laboratory or an equal/higher positions.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:  
*""12"" = ""5+""

==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==
*[[National Technical University of Ukraine]]
*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 ==Languages used in Educational Establishments==
 In 2000/2001 [[academic year]], 70% of students attended Ukrainian-language schools (that is where [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is the primary language of instruction), while 29% were studying in [[Russian language|Russian-language]] schools. There are schools with instruction in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Polish language|Polish]] in regions populated by those groups.
 Historically, the language of instruction has often changed in Ukraine. When Ukraine was part of the [[Russian Empire]], the Ukrainian language was proscribed, and Russian predominated among the elite, who had access to schools.
-The initial policies of the [[Bolsheviks]] were supportive of local languages, and many Ukrainian-language schools were opened, with the long-term goal of getting rid of illiteracy. From the mid-1930s to the mid-1980s, the Soviet government policies favoured [[Russification]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, the number of Russian-language schools constantly increased at the expense of Ukrainian-language schools. After Ukraine obtaining independence the trend was reversed. However, reintroduction of formal Ukrainian-language study has taken longer than expected. In some schools that have tried to switch to Ukrainian, part or most of the instruction is still given in Russian.

There are schools with instruction in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Polish language|Polish]] in regions populated by those groups.
 Historically, the language of instruction has often changed in Ukraine. When Ukraine was part of the [[Russian Empire]], the Ukrainian language was proscribed, and Russian predominated among the elite, who had access to schools.
 The initial policies of the [[Bolsheviks]] were supportive of local languages, and many Ukrainian-language schools were opened, with the long-term goal of getting rid of illiteracy. From the mid-1930s to the mid-1980s, the Soviet government policies favoured [[Russification]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, the number of Russian-language schools constantly increased at the expense of Ukrainian-language schools. After Ukraine obtaining independence the trend was reversed. However, reintroduction of formal Ukrainian-language study has taken longer than expected. In some schools that have tried to switch to Ukrainian, part or most of the instruction is still given in Russian.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==
*[[National Technical University of Ukraine]]
*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:  
*""12"" = ""5+""
*""11"" = ""5""
*""10"" = ""5-""

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years).

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education.

A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 {{Main article|Higher education in Ukraine}}
 [[Higher education in Ukraine|Higher education]] is either state funded or private. Students who study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term exams and differentiated test is at least 4 (see the 5-point grade system below); this rule may be different in some universities. In the case of all grades being the highest (5), the scholarship is increased by 25%. For most students the level of government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic living expenses. Most universities provide subsidized housing for out-of-city students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students.
-There are two degrees conferred by Ukrainian universities: the bachelor's degree (4&nbsp;years) and the master's degree (5–6th&nbsp;year). These degrees are introduced in accordance with [[Bologna process]], in which Ukraine is taking part. Historically, Specialist's Degree (usually 5 years) is still also granted; it was the only degree awarded by universities in the Soviet times.

Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:

 Students who get a failing grade of ""2"", have two more chances to pass an examination.
 Since 2006 (and even earlier in some universities), university students are graded on a rating scale of 0 to 100. These grades can be transformed to the 5-point scale approximately as follows (this system may vary a little from university to university and may change from time to time):
 *from 90 to 100 means ""5"" —– A
-*from 75 to 89  means ""4"" —— B,C

I level of accreditation comprises grades 1 to 4. Grades 5-9 are usually considered a II level of accreditation or a base secondary education, while 10-11 are a III level. Despite the names, students usually study in the same school institution throughout their primary and secondary education. [[Primary school]]ing lasts 4 years and [[middle school]] 5.

==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==
*[[National Technical University of Ukraine]]
*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:  
*""12"" = ""5+""
*""11"" = ""5""
*""10"" = ""5-""
*""9"" = ""4+""
*""8"" = ""4""

And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 The initial policies of the [[Bolsheviks]] were supportive of local languages, and many Ukrainian-language schools were opened, with the long-term goal of getting rid of illiteracy. From the mid-1930s to the mid-1980s, the Soviet government policies favoured [[Russification]].

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.
 ''Kandidat Nauk'' may keep the position Associate Professor in universities, or Researcher/Senior Researcher in scientific institutes. ''Doctor Nauk'' can hold position of full Professor, Head of Laboratory or an equal/higher positions.

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:

""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.
 ''Kandidat Nauk'' may keep the position Associate Professor in universities, or Researcher/Senior Researcher in scientific institutes. ''Doctor Nauk'' can hold position of full Professor, Head of Laboratory or an equal/higher positions.
 The Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science is considering changing the Soviet style ''Kandidat Nauk'' and ''Doctor Nauk'' degrees to Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor Habilitation, as has happened in several other post-Soviet countries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,

""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

In 2008 entrance exams were abolished and the IGTs became the standard for determining entrance eligibility.<ref>[http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=z0073-08 Про затвердження Порядку проведення зовнішнього незалежного оцінювання...| від 24.01.2008<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{ref-uk}}</ref> But in 2010 the system was changed again.<!--It's necessary to write more about this, but I don't know details and don't want to look for.-->
 
 In [[school year]] 2009-2010 potential graduates are scheduled to undergo external independent testing after the final state examination, in the following subjects: [[Ukrainian language]] and [[Ukrainian literature|literature]], [[history of Ukraine]], [[mathematics]], [[biology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[geography]], and one foreign language (of the pupil's choice) in either [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The results of the testing will have the same status as entrance examinations to institutions of higher education.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/50275 School leavers to have external independent testing after state final examination], [[Kyiv Post]] (October 8, 2009) {{dead link|date=March 2016}}</ref> But some universities can convert points in the external independent test certificate according to their own rating system.

+Since 2018, pre-higher education now lasts for 12 years. This means all students who entered grade 1 in 2018 will graduate after completing grade 12; however this does not apply to students who have completed grade 1 prior to 2018 <ref>https://mon.gov.ua/storage/app/media/zagalna%20serednya/Book-ENG.pdf</ref>.

==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==
*[[National Technical University of Ukraine]]
*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:  
*""12"" = ""5+""
*""11"" = ""5""
*""10"" = ""5-""

 Since 2006 (and even earlier in some universities), university students are graded on a rating scale of 0 to 100. These grades can be transformed to the 5-point scale approximately as follows (this system may vary a little from university to university and may change from time to time):
 *from 90 to 100 means ""5"" —– A
 *from 75 to 89  means ""4"" —— B, C
-*from 60 to 74  means ""3"" —— D
-*from 0  to 59  means ""2"" —— E
+*from 60 to 74  means ""3"" —— D, E
+*from 0  to 59  means ""2"" —— F
 Both the rating scale and the 5-point scale are used in university registers. Some lecturers prefer to use A-F-point scale to rate students during their passing the exams.
 
 As for secondary schools, they also used the above-mentioned 5-point scale till 2000. Since 2000 secondary schools use a 12-point scale, which could be transformed into the traditional 5-point scale as follows:{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}","/* Marks */  correction (as in ECTS scale, therefore in Ukrainian universities as well, E is a passing grade which is equal to 3)",46.219.215.64,2019-08-04T22:20:06Z,"Changed the grading scale representation by modifying the grades associated with the scores: ""Removed 'E' from the D grade and added 'F' for the failing grade.""

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education.

A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 {{Main article|Higher education in Ukraine}}
 [[Higher education in Ukraine|Higher education]] is either state funded or private. Students who study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term exams and differentiated test is at least 4 (see the 5-point grade system below); this rule may be different in some universities. In the case of all grades being the highest (5), the scholarship is increased by 25%. For most students the level of government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic living expenses. Most universities provide subsidized housing for out-of-city students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students.

 There are two degrees conferred by Ukrainian universities: the bachelor's degree (4&nbsp;years) and the master's degree (5–6th&nbsp;year). These degrees are introduced in accordance with [[Bologna process]], in which Ukraine is taking part. Historically, Specialist's Degree (usually 5 years) is still also granted; it was the only degree awarded by universities in the Soviet times.  Almost all major universities are located in oblast centers.

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Students who study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term exams and differentiated test is at least 4 (see the 5-point grade system below); this rule may be different in some universities. In the case of all grades being the highest (5), the scholarship is increased by 25%. For most students the level of government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic living expenses. Most universities provide subsidized housing for out-of-city students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students.

==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==
*[[National Technical University of Ukraine]]
*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:  
*""12"" = ""5+""
*""11"" = ""5""
*""10"" = ""5-""
*""9"" = ""4+""
*""8"" = ""4""

 ===Postgraduate level===
 {{Main article|Postgraduate education in Ukraine}}
-Upon obtaining a master's degree or Specialist, a student may enter a university or a scientific institute to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' that usually results in the ''Kandydat Nauk'' degree ([[Candidate of Sciences]]). Candidates must pass three or more qualifying exams (one or more in the field of specialty, one in a foreign language of their choice and one in philosophy), publish at least five papers in peer reviewed journals (according to requirements existed up to 2013 they had to publish at least three papers), write a [[dissertation]] and defend it. This degree is roughly equivalent to the [[Ph.D.]] in the United States.<ref name=""GSE"">{{cite book|title=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]].|publisher=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya|edition=3rd|location=Moscow|language=Russian|nopp=true|page=Vol. 11}}</ref>

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.
 ''Kandidat Nauk'' may keep the position Associate Professor in universities, or Researcher/Senior Researcher in scientific institutes. ''Doctor Nauk'' can hold position of full Professor, Head of Laboratory or an equal/higher positions.
 The Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science is considering changing the Soviet style ''Kandidat Nauk'' and ''Doctor Nauk'' degrees to Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor Habilitation, as has happened in several other post-Soviet countries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:

Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education.

+The institution is called ''Middle School of General Education'' (ZOSh) or simply ''Middle School,'' and usually combines primary and secondary levels of education. The system was first introduced in 1958 and included a 12-grade system, while in 1965 it was a 10-grade system. Most  middle schools have all three levels of accreditation for General Education. Some remote schools have only two levels, which is the minimum requirement for all middle schools.
+
+Primary and secondary education is divided into three levels of accreditation of general education: I - ""younger"", II - ""middle"", and III - ""senior"". Level 1  comprises grades 1 to 4. Grades 5-9 are usually considered a II level of accreditation or a base secondary education, while 10-12 are a III level. Despite the names, students usually study in the same school throughout their primary and secondary education. [[Primary school|Elementary school]]ing lasts for 4 years, [[middle school]] for 5 and [[Secondary school|high school]] for 3.

==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==
*[[National Technical University of Ukraine]]
*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:  
*""12"" = ""5+""
*""11"" = ""5""
*""10"" = ""5-""
*""9"" = ""4+""

==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==
*[[National Technical University of Ukraine]]
*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:

Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==

*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.
 ''Kandidat Nauk'' may keep the position Associate Professor in universities, or Researcher/Senior Researcher in scientific institutes. ''Doctor Nauk'' can hold position of full Professor, Head of Laboratory or an equal/higher positions.
 The Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science is considering changing the Soviet style ''Kandidat Nauk'' and ''Doctor Nauk'' degrees to Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor Habilitation, as has happened in several other post-Soviet countries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==

*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:

-Since 2006 (and even earlier in some universities), university students are graded on a rating scale of 0 to 100. These grades can be transformed to the 5-point scale approximately as follows (this system may vary a little from university to university and may change from time to time):
-*from 90 to 100 means ""5"" —– A
-*from 74 to 89  means ""4"" —— B, C
-*from 60 to 73  means ""3"" —— D, E
-*from 0  to 59  means ""2"" —— F
-Both the rating scale and the 5-point scale are used in university registers. Some lecturers prefer to use A-F-point scale to rate students during their passing the exams.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==

*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

 ===Postgraduate level===
 {{Main article|Postgraduate education in Ukraine}}
-Upon obtaining a master's degree or Specialist, a student may enter a university or a scientific institute to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' that usually results in the ''Kandydat Nauk'' degree ([[Candidate of Sciences]]). Candidates must pass three or more qualifying exams (one or more in the field of specialty, one in a foreign language of their choice and one in philosophy), publish at least five papers in peer reviewed journals (according to requirements existed up to 2013 they had to publish at least three papers), write a [[dissertation]] and defend it. This degree is roughly equivalent to the [[Ph.D.]] in the United States.<ref name=""GSE"">{{cite book|title=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]].|publisher=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya|edition=3rd|location=Moscow|language=ru|no-pp=true|page=Vol. 11}}</ref>

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.
 ''Kandidat Nauk'' may keep the position Associate Professor in universities, or Researcher/Senior Researcher in scientific institutes. ''Doctor Nauk'' can hold position of full Professor, Head of Laboratory or an equal/higher positions.
 The Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science is considering changing the Soviet style ''Kandidat Nauk'' and ''Doctor Nauk'' degrees to Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor Habilitation, as has happened in several other post-Soviet countries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:  
*""12"" = ""5+""
*""11"" = ""5""
*""10"" = ""5-""
*""9"" = ""4+""
*""8"" = ""4""

"This article is about '''[[education]] in [[Ukraine]]'''.

==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==
*[[National Technical University of Ukraine]]
*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:  
*""12"" = ""5+""

Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:

 ===Postgraduate level===
 {{Main article|Postgraduate education in Ukraine}}
-Upon obtaining a master's degree or Specialist, a student may enter a university or a scientific institute to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' that usually results in the ''Kandydat Nauk'' degree ([[Candidate of Sciences]]). Candidates must pass three or more qualifying exams (one or more in the field of specialty, one in a foreign language of their choice and one in philosophy), publish at least five papers in peer reviewed journals (according to requirements existed up to 2013 they had to publish at least three papers), write a [[dissertation]] and defend it. This degree is roughly equivalent to the [[Ph.D.]] in the United States.<ref name=""GSE"">{{cite book|title=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]].|publisher=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya|edition=3rd|location=Moscow|language=ru|no-pp=true|page=Vol. 11}}</ref>

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.
 ''Kandidat Nauk'' may keep the position Associate Professor in universities, or Researcher/Senior Researcher in scientific institutes. ''Doctor Nauk'' can hold position of full Professor, Head of Laboratory or an equal/higher positions.
 The Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science is considering changing the Soviet style ''Kandidat Nauk'' and ''Doctor Nauk'' degrees to Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor Habilitation, as has happened in several other post-Soviet countries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

 ===Postgraduate level===
 {{Main article|Postgraduate education in Ukraine}}
-Upon obtaining a master's degree or Specialist, a student may enter a university or a scientific institute to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' that usually results in the ''Kandydat Nauk'' degree ([[Candidate of Sciences]]). Candidates must pass three or more qualifying exams (one or more in the field of specialty, one in a foreign language of their choice and one in philosophy), publish at least five papers in peer reviewed journals (according to requirements existed up to 2013 they had to publish at least three papers), write a [[dissertation]] and defend it. This degree is roughly equivalent to the [[Ph.D.]] in the United States.<ref name=""GSE"">{{cite book|title=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia|Great Soviet Encyclopedia.]]|publisher=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya|edition=3rd|location=Moscow|language=ru|no-pp=true|page=Vol. 11}}</ref>

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.
-''Kandidat Nauk'' may keep the position Associate Professor in universities, or Researcher/Senior Researcher in scientific institutes. ''Doctor Nauk'' can hold position of full Professor, Head of Laboratory or an equal/higher positions.

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,

 Students who get a failing grade of ""2"", have two more chances to pass an examination.
 Since 2006 (and even earlier in some universities), university students are graded on a rating scale of 0 to 100. These grades can be transformed to the 5-point scale approximately as follows (this system may vary a little from university to university and may change from time to time):

 Both the rating scale and the 5-point scale are used in university registers. Some lecturers prefer to use A-F-point scale to rate students during their passing the exams.
 
 As for secondary schools, they also used the above-mentioned 5-point scale till 2000. Since 2000 secondary schools use a 12-point scale, which could be transformed into the traditional 5-point scale as follows:{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

 Here signs ""+"" and ""-"" denote respectively better and worse version of a mark, for example, ""4-"" means ""somewhat worse than good"".

Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==

*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,

 The initial policies of the [[Bolsheviks]] were supportive of local languages, and many Ukrainian-language schools were opened, with the long-term goal of getting rid of illiteracy. From the mid-1930s to the mid-1980s, the Soviet government policies favoured [[Russification]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, the number of Russian-language schools constantly increased at the expense of Ukrainian-language schools. After Ukraine obtained independence the trend was reversed. However, reintroduction of formal Ukrainian-language study has taken longer than expected. In some schools that have tried to switch to Ukrainian, part or most of the instruction is still given in Russian.
 In universities there are similar trends. In 1991/92 [[academic year]], according to the [[Razumkov Centre]], 49% of high school students were receiving their education in Ukrainian, and 50% in Russian.

-Upon obtaining a master's degree or Specialist, a student may enter a university or a scientific institute to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' that usually results in the ''Kandydat Nauk'' degree ([[Candidate of Sciences]]). Candidates must pass three or more qualifying exams (one or more in the field of specialty, one in a foreign language of their choice and one in philosophy), publish at least five papers in peer-reviewed journals (according to requirements existed up to 2013 they had to publish at least three papers), write a [[dissertation]] and defend it.

 After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. This takes from two to four years of study in ''doctorantura''. Significant scientific results must be obtained and published, and a new thesis written. This produces a ''[[Doktor nauk|Doctor Nauk]]'' degree (Doctor of Sciences), but the more typical way is working in a university or scientific institute with parallel preparation of a thesis. The average time between obtaining ''[[Kandidat]]'' and ''Doctor'' degrees is roughly 10 years, and most of new ''Doctors'' are 40 and more years old. Only one of four ''Kandidats'' reaches this grade.
 ''Kandidat Nauk'' may keep the position associate professor in universities, or Researcher/Senior Researcher in scientific institutes. ''Doctor Nauk'' can hold position of full Professor, Head of Laboratory or an equal/higher positions.

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,

Weaponised

This addition highlights criticism of Ukraine's education law, framing it as a significant issue regarding the rights of national minorities. This aligns with narratives that can be used to portray Ukraine's policies as oppressive, which may serve to weaponize cultural heritage discussions in the context of minority rights.",Weaponised
"This article is about '''[[education]] in [[Ukraine]]'''.

==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==
*[[National Technical University of Ukraine]]
*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:  
*""12"" = ""5+""
*""11"" = ""5""
*""10"" = ""5-""
*""9"" = ""4+""
*""8"" = ""4""
*""7"" = ""4-""
*""6"" = ""3+""
*""5"" = ""3""
*""4"" = ""3-""
*""3"" = ""2+""
*""2"" = ""2""
*""1"" = ""2-""

Grades 5-9 are usually considered a II level of accreditation or a base secondary education, while 10-12 are a III level. Despite the names, students usually study in the same school throughout their primary and secondary education. [[Primary school|Elementary school]]ing lasts for 4 years, [[middle school]] for 5 and [[Secondary school|high school]] for 3.

 In 2000/2001 [[academic year]], 70% of students attended Ukrainian-language schools (that is where [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is the primary language of instruction), while 29% were studying in [[Russian language|Russian-language]] schools. There are schools with instruction in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Polish language|Polish]] in regions populated by those groups.
 Historically, the language of instruction has often changed in Ukraine. When Ukraine was part of the [[Russian Empire]], the Ukrainian language was proscribed, and Russian predominated among the elite, who had access to schools.
 The initial policies of the [[Bolsheviks]] were supportive of local languages, and many Ukrainian-language schools were opened, with the long-term goal of getting rid of illiteracy. From the mid-1930s to the mid-1980s, the Soviet government policies favoured [[Russification]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, the number of Russian-language schools constantly increased at the expense of Ukrainian-language schools. After Ukraine obtained independence the trend was reversed. However, reintroduction of formal Ukrainian-language study has taken longer than expected. In some schools that have tried to switch to Ukrainian, part or most of the instruction is still given in Russian.
 In universities there are similar trends. In 1991/92 [[academic year]], according to the [[Razumkov Centre]], 49% of high school students were receiving their education in Ukrainian, and 50% in Russian.
 
-As of 2024, the number of secondary schools in which education takes place exclusively in the Ukrainian language, in 2023 was 12,155 - 98.4%. In addition, 3,834,708 students - 99.1% - study Ukrainian. 447 schoolchildren (0.01%) continue to study in Russian at the level of the state language. In the 2022/2023 academic year, there were 1,362 of them. In 2022, the number of students studying Russian in schools decreased more than 100 times: from 454,800 in September 2021 to about 4,000 as of September 1, 2022.

==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==
*[[National Technical University of Ukraine]]
*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:  
*""12"" = ""5+""
*""11"" = ""5""
*""10"" = ""5-""
*""9"" = ""4+""
*""8"" = ""4""
*""7"" = ""4-""
*""6"" = ""3+""
*""5"" = ""3""
*""4"" = ""3-""
*""3"" = ""2+""
*""2"" = ""2""
*""1"" = ""2-""

==General information==
Ukraine's educational system has produced nearly 100% literacy.

==Major universities==
*[[National Technical University of Ukraine]]
*[[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev]]
*[[Kharkiv National University]]
*[[Donetsk National University]]

==Ukrainian educational system==
Simiralry to [[Education in Russia|Russian educational system]], Ukriane's one may be arranged into three major groups: secondary education, higher education, and postgraduate education. 

Since 2005 12-year school system was introduced in Unkraine: primary education takes 4 years to complete (engaging six-year-old children), middle education takes 5 years to complete, depending on the school. And then there are 3 profile years. Full secondary education is compulsory for all Ukrainian citizens. 

The higher education can be obtained at the expense of either state budget or own. It is common practice that an university entrant doesn't need to pass entrance examination to enter university if he/she will study at the his/her own expense (actually there are some examsbut they are formal only).

Students that study at the expense of state receive scholarship of 136 [[hryvnia]]s if their average mark of end-of-term exams (""sessiya"" - ""сессия"") and differentiated test (""differensirovannyi zachot"" – ""дифференцированный зачёт"") is 4 to 4.99. In case of 5 average the scholarship is increased to 170 [[hryvnia]]s.

There are three different degrees that are conferred by Ukrainian universities: Bachelor's Degree (4&nbsp;years), Specialist's Degree (5&ndash;6 years), and Master's Degree (6&nbsp;years). Bachelor's and Master's degrees were introduced relatively recently; they did not exist in the Soviet Union. As Unkraine is taking part in [[Bologna process]] they will eventually replace Specialist's Degree.

After obtaining a Specialist's or Master's Degree, a student may enter a University to pursue postgraduate education. The first level of postgraduate education is ''aspirantura'' ({{lang|ru|аспирантура}}) that usually results in the Candidate of Sciences Degree ({{lang|ru|кандидат наук}}). This degree is roughly equivalent to the Ph.D. in the United States.  After graduation a student may continue postgraduate education. Four years of study would result in the Doctor's Degree ({{lang|ru|доктор наук}}) . A Candidate of Sciences Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of assistant professor and a Doctor's Degree may be accompanied by honorary degree of professor.

===Marks===

Ukrainian univesities use traditional 5-grade scale:
""5"" = excellent,
""4"" = good,
""3"" = acceptable,
""2"" = ""unacceptable"" (Fail).

If student gets ""2"" he/she has 3 chances to resit an examination.

Since 2001 schools use 12-grade scale:  
*""12"" = ""5+""
*""11"" = ""5""
*""10"" = ""5-""
*""9"" = ""4+""
