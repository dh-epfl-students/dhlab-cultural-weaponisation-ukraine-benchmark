 ==Christmas Traditions==
 
-At [[Christmas]] time there is a custom on the night of Christmas Eve to have a 12 course meal, symbolic of the 12 apostles. This custom is practiced by both the Ukrainian [[Catholic]] and [[Orthodox]] Churches, and is also practiced outside of Ukraine's borders by the people of the Diaspora. This meal is both meatless and dairyless. It usually consists of a few fish dishes (baked fish, pickled herrring), Verenyky, Holobtsi, Kolach (round braided bread), Kutya (cooked wheat with poppies, and honey or sugar - only made in the Christmas season), some mushroom dishes, Garlic, as well as a few others.

-There are also symbolic accompaniments to the meal.  One such example is that the meal starts in the evening as soon as the first star is seen in the sky. This is of course linked to the star that the wise men followed to reach Jesus. There is also a candle in the window to show that anyone wandering the street, that doesn't have a place to go is welcome to join the family for the evening and celebrate. Since this meal is supposed to be just a family affair, for the night the guest is considered an honourary family member. The use of wheat is also important.  There is usually a sheave of wheat placed in the corner near the table. This is to remind the family of the ancestors that have passed on, and to symbolize their presence at the meal. Also wheat is placed under the tablecloth and under the table. Also, an extra plate is set at the table, this plate is for Jesus, as it is believed he is present at the meal.

-Carols are also an important part of the Christmas tradition. Some carols reach back into the pre-christianity period of Ukraine. The most widely recognizeable Ukrainian Carol is the ""Carol of the Bells"" which is actually not a christmas carol but a New Years carol titled ""Shchedryk"" in Ukrainian. Christmas carols are a tradition that the entire family participates in. In addition, one is only allowed to sing these carols during the Christmas season, and never out of season.

This custom is practiced by both the Ukrainian [[Catholic]] and [[Orthodox]] Churches, and is also practiced outside of Ukraine's borders by the people of the [[Diaspora]]. This meal is both meatless and [[dairy|dairyless]]. It usually consists of a few fish dishes (baked fish, pickled [[herring]]), verenyky, holobtsi, kolach (round braided [[bread]]), kutya (cooked wheat with [[poppy|poppies]], and [[honey]] or [[sugar]] - only made in the Christmas season), some [[mushroom]] dishes, and [[garlic]], as well as a few other ingredients.
 
-There are also symbolic accompaniments to the meal.  One such example is that the meal starts in the evening as soon as the first star is seen in the sky. This is of course linked to the star that the wise men followed to reach Jesus. There is also a candle in the window to show that anyone wandering the street, that doesn't have a place to go is welcome to join the family for the evening and celebrate. Since this meal is supposed to be just a family affair, for the night the guest is considered an honourary family member. The use of wheat is also important.  There is usually a sheave of wheat placed in the corner near the table. This is to remind the family of the ancestors that have passed on, and to symbolize their presence at the meal. Also wheat is placed under the tablecloth and under the table. Also, an extra plate is set at the table, this plate is for Jesus, as it is believed he is present at the meal.

-[[Carols]] are also an important part of the Christmas tradition. Some carols reach back into the pre-christianity period of Ukraine. The most widely recognizeable Ukrainian Carol is the ""Carol of the Bells"" which is actually not a christmas carol but a New Years carol titled ""Shchedryk"" in Ukrainian. Christmas carols are a tradition that the entire family participates in. In addition, one is only allowed to sing these carols during the Christmas season, and never at any other time.

+Food
+
+Cultural food is an important part to the Ukrainian culture.  Special foods are used at Easter as well as Christmas, that are not made at any other point during the year. The most known foods are: Borshch (a vegetable soup, most often made with beets), Holobtsi (Cabbage Rolls), Verenyky (Often called Perogies), and Pyrohy (a fried, dessert version of Verenyky).
+
+Chirstmas Traditions
+
+At Christmastime there is a custom on the night of Christmas Eve to have a 12 course meal, symbolic of the 12 apostles.

+Ukrainians generally carry themselves in a very civilized manner. Men always hold the door open for a woman when she enters a builing, stand up when a woman enters the room, and, if there is a shortage of seats, will give up their seats to the women. In rural areas men will sometimes kiss a woman's hand, but this is starting to go out of fashion.
+
+Some rules to rememeber in Ukraine include:
+
+- Never shake hands over a threshold
+- Never put a bottle on the corner of a table
+- Always bring an odd number of flowers to a house
+- Women should never sit on cement
+- When passing through the aisles of a theatre, always face the people sitting down

-Cultural [[food]] is an important part to the Ukrainian culture.  Special foods are used at [[Easter]] as well as [[Christmas]], that are not made at any other time of the year. The most well known foods are: [[Borshch]] (a vegetable soup, most often made with beets), [[holobtsi]] ([[cabbage]] rolls), verenyky (often called [[pierogi]]), and pyrohy (a fried, dessert version of verenyky).

 ==Christmas Traditions==
 
-At [[Christmas]] time there is a custom on the night of [[Christmas]] Eve to have a 12 course meal, symbolic of the 12 [[apostles]]. This custom is practiced by both the Ukrainian [[Catholic]] and [[Orthodox]] Churches, and is also practiced outside of Ukraine's borders by the people of the [[Diaspora]]. This meal is both meatless and [[dairy|dairyless]]. It usually consists of a few fish dishes (baked fish, pickled [[herring]]), verenyky, holobtsi, kolach (round braided [[bread]]), kutya (cooked wheat with [[poppy|poppies]], and [[honey]] or [[sugar]] - only made in the Christmas season), some [[mushroom]] dishes, and [[garlic]], as well as a few other ingredients.

-There are also [[symbolism|symbolic]] accompaniments to the meal.  One such example is that the meal starts in the evening, as soon as the first [[star]] is seen in the [[sky]]. This is of course linked to the star that the [[Magi|wise men]] followed to reach [[Jesus]]. There is also a [[candle]] in the window to show that anyone wandering the street that doesn't have a place to go is welcome to join the family for the evening and celebrate. As the meal is supposed to be just a family affair, for the night the guest is considered an honourary family member. The use of wheat is also important.  There is usually a sheaf of wheat placed in the corner near the table. This is to remind the family of the ancestors that have passed on, and to symbolise their presence at the meal. Also wheat is placed under the tablecloth and under the table. Also, an extra plate is set at the table; this plate is for Jesus, as it is believed he is present at the meal.

-[[Carols]] are also an important part of the Christmas tradition. Some carols reach back into the pre-christianity period of Ukraine. The most widely recognised Ukrainian carol is the ""Carol of the Bells"" (which is actually not a christmas carol but a [[New Year]]'s carol, titled ""Shchedryk"" in Ukrainian). Christmas carols are a tradition that the entire family participates in. In addition, one is only allowed to sing these carols during the Christmas season, and never at any other time.

 A Ukrainian style of dancing is called [[Kalyna]]. Both men and women participate in this type of dancing. 
-*The women wear colourful costumes, sometimes featuring a solid-coloured (usually blue, green, red, or black) tunic and matching apron, and under that an open skirt, and below that a white skirt with an embroidered hem that should reach an inch or so below the knee. If they wear a tunic, then under that they wear a long-sleeved richly embroidered white shirt. Traditionally, women wear a type of red leather boots to dance in. They also wear a beautiful flower head piece, that is a headband covered with flowers and has long flowing ribbons down the back that flow when they dance, and plain red beaded necklaces.
-*The men wear baggy pants (usually blue, white, black or red) and a shirt (usually white, but sometimes black) embroidered at the neck and down the stomach. Over the shirt they wear a richly embroidered vest. Around their waste they wear a thick sash with fringed ends. Like the women, they wear boots, but these can be black or white in addition to red.
-*Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the [[previtanya]], is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with salt on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[Hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements.

+== Weddings ==
 Weddings traditionally take place in churches, the bride in white and the groom in black. Wedding celebrations are known to continue for days, even a week. They are accompanied by lively music and dancing, drinking and eating, and fellowship. 
 Some particular wedding customs include:
-*Before the wedding, the bride and groom's family presents the bride with bread with salt and flowers to wish her prosperity in her marriage.
-*When leaving the church, the bride carries a basket of candies or sweets to throw to children and the crowd. 
-*The groom carries her down any stairs.
-*At the reception, the bride dances with each of the unmarried women present, and places a special veil on each of them. This veil symbolises that they are still pure, but that the bride hopes they will get married soon.
-*The groom sits on a pillow placed on a chair and removes the bride's stockings. This symbolises that she is a woman.

 Ukrainians generally carry themselves in a very polite, civilized manner. Men always hold the door open for a woman when she enters a building, stand up when a woman enters the room, and, if there is a shortage of seats, will give up their seats to the women. In rural areas men will sometimes kiss a woman's hand, but this is starting to go out of fashion.

 There are also [[symbolism|symbolic]] accompaniments to the meal.  The meal starts in the evening, as soon as the first evening [[star]] is seen, representing the star that the [[Magi|wise men]] followed to reach [[Jesus]]. There is also a [[candle]] in the window to show that anyone wandering the street that doesn't have a place to go is welcome to join the family for the evening and celebrate. As the meal is supposed to be just a family affair, for the night the guest is considered an honorary family member. The use of wheat is also important.  There is usually a sheaf of wheat placed in the corner near the table, to remind the family of the ancestors that have passed on, and to symbolise their presence at the table. Also wheat is placed under the tablecloth and under the table. Also, an extra plate is set at the table for Jesus.

Men always hold the door open for a woman when she enters a building, stand up when a woman enters the room, and, if there is a shortage of seats, will give up their seats to the women.

Over the shirt they sometimes will wear a richly embroidered vest. Around their waist they wear a thick sash with fringed ends. Like the women, they wear boots, but these can be black or white in addition to red.
 * Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the [[previtanya]], is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with salt on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].

 Ukrainians generally carry themselves in a very polite, civilized manner.

In rural areas men will sometimes kiss a woman's hand, but this is starting to go out of fashion.

At Christmas time, for example, ''[[kutia]]'' - a mixture of cooked buckwheat groats, poppy seeds, and honey, and special sweet breads - is prepared.

 [[Food]] is an important part to the Ukrainian culture.  Special foods are used at [[Easter]] as well as [[Christmas]], that are not made at any other time of the year. At Christmas time, for example, ''[[kutia]]'' - a mixture of cooked buckwheat groats, poppy seeds, and honey, and special sweet breads - is prepared.
 
 Ukrainians like fish, cheeses and a variety of sausages. Typically bread is a core part of every meal, and must be included for the meal to be ""complete.""  At Christmas time, for example, it is tradition to have a [[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|twelve-course meal]]. Included at Easter are the famous [[Pysanky]] (coloured and patterned eggs). Making these eggs is a long but fun process, and they are not actually eaten, but displayed in the centre of the table (usually around the bread).

Like the women, they wear boots, but these can be black or white in addition to red.
 * Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the [[previtanya]], is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with salt on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].

 Ukrainians generally carry themselves in a very polite, civilized manner. Men often hold the door open for a woman when she enters a building, stand up when a woman enters the room, and, if there is a shortage of seats, men will give up their seats to the women. In rural areas, men will sometimes kiss a woman's hand, but this is starting to go out of fashion.
  
 According to convention, when standing at a threshold (doorsill), do not shake hands or offer anything to be taken by the person on the other side. A young unmarried man or woman should not be seated at a table's corner.  Always buy an odd number of flowers as a gift, unless it is a funeral.  In that case, it is appropriate to buy an even number. When passing through the aisles in a theater or elsewhere, it is polite to face the people sitting down.

 According to convention, when standing at a threshold (doorsill), do not shake hands or offer anything to be taken by the person on the other side. A young unmarried man or woman should not be seated at a table's corner.  Always buy an odd number of flowers as a gift, unless it is a funeral.  In that case, it is appropriate to buy an even number. When passing through the aisles in a theater or elsewhere, it is polite to face the people sitting down.

 The town of Pripyat, Ukraine was the site of the Chernobyl accident, which occurred in April 26, 1986 when a nuclear plant exploded. The fallout contaminated large areas of northern Ukraine and even parts of Belarus. This spurred on a local independence movement called the Rukh that plagued the Soviet Union during the late 1980s.
 
 Ukraine declared itself an independent state on August 24, 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and was a founding member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). On December 1, 1991 Ukrainian voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum formalizing independence from the Soviet Union. The Union formally ceased to exist in December 25, 1991, and with this Ukraine's independence was officially recognized by the international community.

+[edit] Life
+Born into a serf family in the village of Moryntsi, of Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire (now in Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine) Shevchenko was orphaned at the age of eleven.[1] He was taught to read by a village precentor, and loved to draw at every opportunity. Shevchenko went with his Russian aristocrat lord Pavel Engelhardt to Vilna (Vilnius, 1828–31) and then to Saint Petersburg.
+
+Engelhardt noticed Shevchenko's artistic talent and apprenticed him in Vilna to Jan Rustem, then in Saint Petersburg to Vasiliy Shiriaev for four years. There he met the Ukrainian artist Ivan Soshenko, who introduced him to other compatriots such as Yevhen Hrebinka and Vasyl Hryhorovych, and to the Russian painter Alexey Venetsianov. Through these men Shevchenko also met the famous painter and professor Karl Briullov, who donated his portrait of the Russian poet Vasily Zhukovsky as a lottery prize, whose proceeds were used to buy Shevchenko's freedom on May 5, 1838.[1]
+
+
+[edit] First Successes
+ 
+Self-portrait of Taras Shevchenko, 1840.In the same year Shevchenko was accepted as a student into the Academy of Arts in the workshop of Karl Briullov. The next year he became a resident student at the Association for the Encouragement of Artists. At the annual examinations at the Imperial Academy of Arts, Shevchenko was given a Silver Medal for a landscape. In 1840 he again received the Silver Medal, this time for his first oil painting, The Beggar Boy Giving Bread to a Dog.
+
+He began writing poetry while he was a serf and in 1840 his first collection of poetry, Kobzar, was published. Ivan Franko, the renowned Ukrainian poet in the generation after Shevchenko, had this to say of the compilation: ""[Kobzar] immediately revealed, as it were, a new world of poetry. It burst forth like a spring of clear, cold water, and sparkled with a clarity, breadth and elegance of artistic expression not previously known in Ukrainian writing.""
+
+ 
+Gypsy Fortune Teller. 1841. Oil on canvas. Winner of the 1841 Silver Medal at the Imperial Academy of Arts.In 1841, the epic poem Haidamaky was released. In September of 1841, Shevchenko was awarded his third Silver Medal for The Gypsy Fortune Teller. Shevchenko also wrote plays. In 1842, he released a part of the tragedy Nykyta Hayday and in 1843 he completed the drama Nazar Stodolya.
+
+While residing in Saint Petersburg, Shevchenko made three trips to Ukraine, in 1843, 1845, and 1846. The difficult conditions under which his countrymen lived had a profound impact on the poet-painter. Shevchenko visited his still enserfed siblings and other relatives, met with prominent Ukrainian writers and intellectuals such as: Yevhen Hrebinka, Panteleimon Kulish, and Mykhaylo Maksymovych, and was befriended by the princely Repnin family especially Varvara Repnina.
+
+In 1844, distressed by the condition of Ukraine in the Russian Empire, Shevchenko decided to capture some of his homeland's historical ruins and cultural monuments in an album of etchings, which he called Picturesque Ukraine.
+
+
+[edit] Exile
+ 
+Self-portrait as a soldier, 1847.On March 22, 1845, the Council of the Academy of Arts granted Shevchenko the title of an artist. He again travelled to Ukraine where he met the historian, Nikolay Kostomarov and other members of the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius, a political society dedicated to the political liberalization of the Empire and transforming it into a federation-like polity of Slavic nations. Upon the society's suppression by the authorities, Shevchenko was arrested along with other members on April 5, 1847. Although he probably was not an official member of the Brotherhood, during the search his poem ""The Dream"" (""Son"") was found. This poem criticized imperial rule, personally attacked Emperor Nicholas I and his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, and therefore was considered extremely inflammatory, and of all the members of the dismantled society Shevchenko was punished most severely.
+
+Shevchenko was sent to prison in Saint Petersburg. He was exiled as a private with the Russian military Orenburg garrison at Orsk, near Orenburg, near the Ural Mountains. Tsar Nicholas I, confirming his sentence, added to it, ""Under the strictest surveillance, without a right to write or paint.""
+
+With the exception of some short periods of his exile, the enforcement of the Tsar's ban on his creative work was lax. The poet produced several drawings and sketches as well as writings while serving and traveling on assignment in the Ural regions and areas on modern Kazakhstan.
+
+But it was not until 1857 that Shevchenko finally returned from exile after receiving a pardon, though he was not permitted to return to St. Petersburg but was ordered to Nizhniy Novgorod. In May of 1859, Shevchenko got permission to move to his native Ukraine. He intended to buy a plot of land not far from the village of Pekariv and settle in Ukraine. In July, he was arrested on a charge of blasphemy, but was released and ordered to return to St. Petersburg.
+
+
+[edit] Death of Shevchenko
+ 
+Last self-portrait, 1860.Taras Shevchenko spent the last years of his life working on new poetry, paintings, and engravings, as well as editing his older works. But after his difficult years in exile his final illness proved too much. Shevchenko died in Saint Petersburg on March 10, 1861, the day after his 47th birthday.
+
+He was first buried at the Smolensk Cemetery in Saint Petersburg. However, fulfilling Shevchenko's wish, expressed in his poem ""Testament"" (""Zapovit""), to be buried in Ukraine, his friends arranged to transfer his remains by train to Moscow and then by horse-drawn wagon to his native land. Shevchenko's remains were buried on May 8 on Chernecha Hill (Monk's Hill; now Taras Hill) by the Dnieper River near Kaniv.[1] A tall mound was erected over his grave, now a memorial part of the Kaniv Museum-Preserve.
+
+Dogged by terrible misfortune in love and life, the poet died seven days before the Emancipation of Serfs was announced. His works and life are revered by Ukrainians and his impact on Ukrainian literature is immense.
+
+
+[edit] Heritage and legacy
+
+[edit] Impact
+ 
+100 hryvnias 
+1939 Soviet monument to Taras Shevchenko in Kiev, Ukraine, is located across the Kiev University that bears the poet's name.[2]Taras Shevchenko has a unique place in Ukrainian cultural history and in world literature. His writings formed the foundation for the modern Ukrainian literature to a degree that he is also considered the founder of the modern written Ukrainian language (although Ivan Kotlyarevsky pioneered the literary work in what was close to the modern Ukrainian in the end of the eighteenth century.) Shevchenko's poetry contributed greatly to the growth of Ukrainian national consciousness, and his influence on various facets of Ukrainian intellectual, literary, and national life is still felt to this day. Influenced by Romanticism, Shevchenko managed to find his own manner of poetic expression that encompassed themes and ideas germane to Ukraine and his personal vision of its past and future.
+
+In view of his literary importance, the impact of his artistic work is often missed although his contemporaries valued his artistic work no less, or perhaps even more, than the literary one. A great number of his pictures, drawings and etchings preserved to this day testify for his unique artistic talent. He also experimented with the photography and it is little known that Shevchenko may be considered to have pioneered the art of etching in the Russian Empire (in 1860 he was awarded the title of the Academician in the Imperial Academy of Arts specifically for his achievements in etching.)[3]
+
+ 
+Commemorative coin issued in the USSR in 1989 on his 175th anniv.His influence on the Ukrainian culture has been so immense, that even at Soviet times, the official position was to downplay strong Ukrainian nationalism expressed in his poetry, suppressing any mention of it, and to put an emphasis on the social and anti-Tsarist aspects of his legacy, the Class struggle within the Russian Empire. Shevchenko, who himself was born a serf and suffered tremendously for his political views in opposition to the established order of the Empire, was presented in the Soviet times as an internationalist who stood up in general for the plight of the poor classes exploited by the reactionary political regime rather than the vocal proponent of the Ukrainian national idea.
+
+This view is significantly revised in modern independent Ukraine, where he is now viewed as almost an iconic figure with unmatched significance for the Ukrainian nation, a view that has been mostly shared all along by the Ukrainian diaspora that has always revered Shevchenko.
+
+
+[edit] Monuments and memorials
+ 
+The ceremonial opening of the monument by the Latvian sculptor Janis Tilbergs to Taras Shevchenko in Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) on December 1, 1918. The inscription says: ""To the great Ukrainian poet-pesant T. G. Shevchenko (1814 - 1861) from the great Russian nation."" The plaster monument existed for only eight years due to the deterioration of the material in the open air. It was planned to be replaced by a bronze version, which never happened.There are many monuments to Shevchenko throughout Ukraine, most notably at his memorial in Kaniv and in the center of Kiev, just across from the Kiev University that bears his name. The Kiev Metro station, Tarasa Shevchenka, is also dedicated to Shevchenko. Among other notable monuments to the poet located throughout Ukraine are the ones in Kharkiv (in front of the Shevchenko Park), Lviv, Luhansk and many others.
+
+Outside of Ukraine, monuments to Shevchenko have been put up in several location of the former USSR associated with his legacy, both in the Soviet and the post-Soviet times. The modern monument in Saint Petersburg was erected on December 22, 2000, but the first monument (pictured) was built in the city in 1918 on the order of Lenin shortly after the Great Russian Revolution. There is also a monument located next to the Shevchenko museum at the square that bears the poet's name in Orsk, Russia (the location of the military garrison where the poet served) where there are also a street, a library and the Pedagogical Institute named to the poet.[4] There are Shevchenko monuments and museums in the cities of Kazakhstan where he was later transferred by the military: Aqtau (the city was named Shevchenko between 1964 and 1992) and nearby Fort Shevchenko (renamed from Fort Alexandrovsky in 1939).
+
+After Ukraine gained its independence in the wake of the 1991 Soviet Collapse, some Ukrainian cities replaced their statues of Lenin with statues of Taras Shevchenko[5] and in some locations that lacked streets named to him, local authorities renamed the streets or squares to Shevchenko, even though these sites usually have little or no connection to his biography. These memorials testify, perhaps, to a greater spirit of patriotism than historical accuracy.
+
+Outside of Ukraine and the former USSR, monuments to Shevchenko have been put up in many countries, usually under the initiative of local Ukrainian diasporas. There are several memorial societies and monuments to him throughout Canada and the United States, most notably a monument in Washington, D.C., near Dupont Circle. There is also a monument in Tipperary Hill in Syracuse, United States, a park named after him in Elmira Heights, N.Y. and a street named after him in New York City's East Village.
+
+The town of Vita in Manitoba, Canada was originally named Shevchenko in his honor. There is a Shevchenko Square in Paris located in the heart of the central Saint-Germain-des-Prés district. The Leo Mol sculpture garden in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, contains many images of Taras Shevchenko.
+
+A two-tonne bronze statue of Shevchenko, located in a memorial park outside of Oakville, Ontario was discovered stolen in December 2006. It was taken for scrap metal; the head was recovered in a damaged state, but the statue was not repairable.
+
+In 2001, the Ukrainian society ""Prosvita"" raised the initiative of building a Church near the Chernecha Mount in Kaniv, where Taras Shevchenko is buried.[6] [7] The initiative got a rather supportive response in the society. Since than many charity events have been held all over the country to gather donations for the above purpose. A marathon under the slogan ""Let’s Build a Church for the Kobzar"" by the First National Radio Channel of Ukraine has collected 39 thousand hryvnias (about 1,600 US dollars) in October, 2003.

-== UKRAINIAN HISTORY ==
-
-
-History of Ukraine
-
-Early pre-history
-The first identifiable groups to populate what is now Ukraine were the Neolithic people of the Trypillian culture, followed by the Iranians (Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians), and Goths, among other nomadic peoples who arrived throughout the first millennium BC. During this period, the plains of Scythia were the road for the migration of peoples from Asia into Europe.
-
-Around 600 B.C., the ancient Greeks founded on the north-eastern shore of the Black Sea the colonies of Tyras, Olbia, Hermonassa, perpetuated by Roman and Byzantine cities until the sixth century A.D.
-
-Slavic tribes occupied central and eastern plains of Scythia as early as the sixth century. Around this time the Antes civilization which may have been a largely Slavic nation, occupied much of Ukraine.
-
- 
-
-
-Kievan Rus'
-In the 9th century, Kiev was conquered from the Khazars by the Varangian (Swedish Viking) Oleg. The Khazars were a Turkic semi-nomadic people from Central Asia who adopted Judaism. They founded the independent Khazar kingdom in the 7th century C.E. in the southeastern part of today's Europe, near the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus. In addition to western Kazakhstan, the Khazar kingdom also included territory in what is now eastern Ukraine, Azerbaijan, southern Russia, and Crimea.
-
-During this time, several Slavic tribes were native to Ukraine, including the Polanians, the Derevlianians, the Severians, the Ulychians, and Tivertsians, and Dulebians. Situated on lucrative trade routes, Kiev among the Polanians quickly prospered as the center of the powerful Slavic/Scandinavian state of Kievan Rus.
-
-In the 11th century, Kievan Rus' was, geographically, the largest state in Europe. During this time, Ukraine became known in the rest of Europe as Ruthenia (the Latin name for Rus', especially after the separation of Russia from Rus' propria). In addition, the name ""Ukraine"" first appears in recorded history on maps of the period. The meaning of term seems to have been synonymous with the land of Rus' propria--the principalities of Kiev, Chernihiv and Pereyaslav. The term, ""Greater Rus' was used to apply to all the lands ruled by Kiev, including those that were not just Slavic, but also Finno-Ugric in the northeast portions of the state. Local regional subdivisions of Rus' appeared in the Slavic heartland, including, ""Belarus'"" (White Ruthenia), ""Chorna Rus'"" (Black Ruthenia) and ""Cherven' Rus'"" (Red Ruthenia) in northwestern and western Ukraine.
-
-Although Christianity had made inroads into Ukraine before the first ecumenical council, the Council of Nicea (particularly along the Black Sea coast) and, in Western Ukraine during the time of empire of Great Moravia, the formal governmental acceptance of Christianity in Rus' occurred at the Baptism of Kiev in 988. The major cause of the Christianization of Ukraine was the Grand-Duke, Volodymyr the Great. His Christian interest was mid-wifed by his grandmother, Princess Olga. Later, an enduring part of the Ukrainian legal tradition was set down by the Kievan ruler, Yaroslav, who promulgated the Russkaya Pravda (Ruthenian Truth) which endured through the Lithuanian period of Rus'.
-
-Conflict among the various principalities of Rus', in spite of the efforts of Grand Prince Vladimir Monomakh, led to decline, beginning in the 12th century. In Rus' propria, the Kiev region, the nascent Ruthenian/Ukrainian principalities of Halych and Volynia extended their rule. In the north, the name of Moscow appeared in the historical record in the principality of Suzdal, which gave rise to the nation of Russia. In the northwest, the principality of Polotsk increasing asserted the autonomy of Belarus'. Kiev was sacked by Russians (1169), Polovtzians and Mongol raiders in the 12th and 13th centuries. Subsequently, all principalities of Ukraine acknowledged dependence upon the Mongols (1239-1240). The Mongol overlordship was very cruel, and people often fled to other countries. Ukrainian settlements appeared in Poland and Hungary.
-
- 
-
-Halych-Volynia
-The local successor state to Kyivan Rus' on the territory of both Kyiv and today's Ukraine was the principality of Halych-Volynia.
-
-Previously, Volodymyr the Great had established the cities of Halych and Volodymyr Volynski as regional capitals for the western Ukrainian heartland. In the thirteenth century, the city of L'viv eventually became the national capital. This new, more exclusively Ukrainian state was based upon the Dulibian, Tivertsian and Bilyy Khorvaty (White Croatian) tribes. The state was ruled by the descendants of Yaroslav Mudry and Volodymyr Monomakh. For a brief period, the country was ruled by a Hungarian nobleman. Battles with the neighboring states of Poland and Lithuania also occurred, as well as internecine warfare with the independent Ukrainian principality of Chernihiv to the east. The nation reached its peak with the extension of rule to neighboring Wallachia/Bessarabia, all the way to the shores of the Black Sea.
-
-During this period (around 1200-1400) each principality was independent of the other for a period of time. The state of Halych-Volynia eventually became a vassal to the Mongolian Empire, but efforts to gain European support for opposition to the Mongols continued. This period marked the first ""King of Rus'""; previously, the rulers of Rus' were termed, ""Grand Dukes"" or ""Princes.""

-
-Loss of Independence
-During the 14th century, Poland and Lithuania fought wars against the Mongol invaders, and eventually most of Ukraine passed to the rule of Poland and Lithuania. More particularly, the lands of Volynia in the north and northwest passed to the rule of Lithuanian princes, while the south-west passed to the control of Poland (Galicia) and Hungary (Zakarpattya). Most of Ukraine bordered parts of Lithuania, and some say that the name, ""Ukraine"" comes from the local word for ""border,"" although the name ""Ukraine"" was also used centuries earlier. Lithuania took control of the state of Volynia in northern/northwestern Ukraine, including the region around Kyiv (Rus'), and the rulers of Lithuania then adopted the title of ruler of Rus'. Poland took control of the region of Halychyna. Following the union between Poland and Lithuania, Poles, Germans, Armenians and Jews immigrated to the country.

-The Commonwealth
-After the Union of Lublin in 1569 and the formation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth the gentry of Ukraine voted for membership in the Polish part of the Commonwealth. The period immediately following the creation of the Commmonwealth, saw a huge revitalization in colonisation efforts. Many new cities and villages were founded. New schools spread the ideas of the Renaissance; Polish peasants who arrived in great numbers were quickly Ruthenised; during this time, many Ukrainian nobles became Polonized. Social tensions also grew. Ruthenian/Ukrainian peasants (and some from other nations) who fled efforts to force them into servitude came to be known as Cossacks and earned a reputation for their fierce martial spirit.
-
-
- 
-The Kozak Era
-The 1648 Ukrainian Kozak (Cossack) rebellion and war of independence (Chmielnicki Uprising), which started an era known in Polish history as The Deluge, undermined the foundations and stability of the Commonwealth. The nascent Cossack Hetmanate, usually viewed as forerunner of the Ukrainian state, found itself in a three-sided military and diplomatic rivalry with the Ottoman Turks, who controlled the Tatars to the south, the Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania, and the rising state of Muscovy to the East. The reconstituted Ukrainian state sought a treaty of protection with Muscovy (the predecessor to the modern Russian state) in 1654. This agreement was known as the Treaty of Pereyaslav. Commonwealth authorities then sought compromise with the Ukrainian Cossack state by signing the Union of Hadyach in 1658, but the agreement was later superseded by 1667 Polish-Russian Treaty of Andrusovo, which divided Ukraine between the Commonwealth and Russia. 
-
- 
-
-Partitions/Transition to Russian/Austrian Rule
-
-
-Tsarist rule over central Ukraine gradually replaced 'protection' over the subsequent decades. Through the Partitions of Poland Ukraine fell under the control of the Austrians in the extreme west (see: Galicia) and of the Russians elsewhere. Ottoman Empire control receded from south-central Ukraine, while the rule of Hungary over the Trans-Carpathian region continued. Ukrainian writers and intellectuals were inspired by the nationalistic spirit stirring other European peoples existing under other imperial governments and became determined to revive the Ukrainian linguistic and cultural traditions and re-establish a Ukrainian nation-state. The Russians in particular imposed strict limits on attempts to elevate Ukrainian language and culture, even banning its use and study. The fate of the Ukrainians was much more positive under the Austrians. During this time, the people of Ukraine began to accept a change of their name from Rus'/Rusyny (Ruthenia/Ruthenians) to Ukraine/Ukrainians.
-
- 
-
-
-The 20th Century
-When World War I and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia shattered the Habsburg and Russian empires, Ukrainians declared independent statehood. Between 1917 and 1918, three separate Ukrainian republics manifested independence, including the Rada, the Directorate, the Hetmanate, and the Ukrainian Peoples Republic of Symon Petlura. However, with the failure of the Kiev Operation and the end of Polish-Soviet War, after the Peace of Riga in March 1921, the western part of the traditional territory had been incorporated into Poland, and the larger, central and eastern part became part of the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian SSR.
-
-The Ukrainian national idea persevered during the inter-war years, and Ukrainian culture even enjoyed a revival due to Bolshevik concessions in the early Soviet years. By the late 1920s, however, the Soviet reaction was severe, particularly under Stalin.
-
-To satisfy the state's need for increased food supplies and finance industrialization, Stalin instituted a program of collectivization of agriculture, which profoundly affected Ukraine, breadbasket of the USSR. In the late 1920s and early '30s the state compounded the peasants' lands and animals into collective farms. Starting in 1929 a policy of enforcement was applied, using regular troops and secret police to confiscate lands and material where necessary.
-
-Many resisted, and a desperate struggle of the peasantry against the authorities ensued. Some slaughtered their livestock rather than turn it over to the collectives. Wealthier peasants were labeled ""kulaks"", enemies of the state. Tens of thousands were executed or deported to labour camps.
-
-Forced collectivization had a devastating effect on agricultural productivity. Despite this, in 1932 Stalin increased Ukraine's production quotas by 44%, ensuring that they could not be met. Soviet law required that the members of a collective farm would receive no grain until government quotas were satisfied. The authorities in many instances exacted such high levels of procurement from collective farms that starvation became widespread. At least four million starved to death in a famine, called the Holodomor in Ukrainian.
-
-The Soviet Union suppressed information about the famine, and as late as the 1980s admitted only that there was some hardship because of kulak sabotage and bad weather. Today, its existence is accepted. Some historians consider the famine of 1932–33 to be the necessary consequence of Stalin's program of industrialization and collectivization. Others maintain that the famine was an avoidable, deliberate act of genocide.
-
-After German and Soviet troops invaded Poland in 1939, (see: Polish September Campaign) the western Ukrainian regions were incorporated into the Soviet Union. When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 (see: Operation Barbarossa), many Ukrainians, particularly in the west, welcomed them, but this did not last. In the encirclement battle of Kiev, acclaimed by the Soviets as a Hero City, more than 660,000 Soviet troops were taken captive.
-
-Some elements of the Ukrainian nationalist underground fought both Nazi and Soviet forces. Others initially regarded the Nazis as ""liberators"", and hoped to establish an autonomous Ukrainian state. However, German rule in the occupied territories eventually aided the Soviet cause. Nazi administrators of conquered Soviet territories made little attempt to exploit the population's dissatisfaction with Soviet political and economic policies. Instead, the Nazis divided the territory of Ukraine, preserved the collective-farm system, systematically carried out genocidal policies against Jews, and deported others (mainly Ukrainians) to forced labour in Germany. Under these circumstances, the great majority of the Soviet people fought and worked on their country's behalf, thus ensuring the regime's survival. However, in some regions of Ukraine, resistance against Soviet forces continued as late as the 1950s.
-
-Total civilian losses during the War and German occupation in Ukraine are estimated at 7 million, including over a million Jews shot and killed by the Einsatzgruppen. The great majority fell victim to atrocities, forced labor, and even massacres of whole villages in reprisal for attacks against Nazi forces. Of the estimated 11 million Soviet troops who fell in battle against the Nazis, about a fourth (2.7 million) were ethnic Ukrainians. Thus, the Ukrainian nation is distinguished as one of the first nations to fight the Axis powers in Carpatho-Ukraine and one that saw some of the greatest bloodshed during the War.
-
- 
-
-
-Independence
-Little changed for Ukraine over the next few decades. During periods of relative liberalization — as under Nikita Khrushchev from 1955 to 1964 — Ukrainian communists pursued national objectives. In the years of perestroika, under U.S.S.R. President Mikhail Gorbachev, national goals were again advanced by Ukrainian officials.
-
-The town of Pripyat, Ukraine was the site of the Chernobyl accident, which occurred in April 26, 1986 when a nuclear plant exploded. The fallout contaminated large areas of northern Ukraine and even parts of Belarus. This spurred on a local independence movement called the Rukh that plagued the Soviet Union during the late 1980s.
-
-Ukraine declared itself an independent state on August 24, 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and was a founding member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). On December 1, 1991 Ukrainian voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum formalizing independence from the Soviet Union. The Union formally ceased to exist in December 25, 1991, and with this Ukraine's independence was officially recognized by the international community.

-[edit] Life
-Born into a serf family in the village of Moryntsi, of Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire (now in Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine) Shevchenko was orphaned at the age of eleven.[1] He was taught to read by a village precentor, and loved to draw at every opportunity. Shevchenko went with his Russian aristocrat lord Pavel Engelhardt to Vilna (Vilnius, 1828–31) and then to Saint Petersburg.
-
-Engelhardt noticed Shevchenko's artistic talent and apprenticed him in Vilna to Jan Rustem, then in Saint Petersburg to Vasiliy Shiriaev for four years. There he met the Ukrainian artist Ivan Soshenko, who introduced him to other compatriots such as Yevhen Hrebinka and Vasyl Hryhorovych, and to the Russian painter Alexey Venetsianov. Through these men Shevchenko also met the famous painter and professor Karl Briullov, who donated his portrait of the Russian poet Vasily Zhukovsky as a lottery prize, whose proceeds were used to buy Shevchenko's freedom on May 5, 1838.[1]
-
-
-[edit] First Successes
- 
-Self-portrait of Taras Shevchenko, 1840.In the same year Shevchenko was accepted as a student into the Academy of Arts in the workshop of Karl Briullov. The next year he became a resident student at the Association for the Encouragement of Artists. At the annual examinations at the Imperial Academy of Arts, Shevchenko was given a Silver Medal for a landscape. In 1840 he again received the Silver Medal, this time for his first oil painting, The Beggar Boy Giving Bread to a Dog.
-
-He began writing poetry while he was a serf and in 1840 his first collection of poetry, Kobzar, was published. Ivan Franko, the renowned Ukrainian poet in the generation after Shevchenko, had this to say of the compilation: ""[Kobzar] immediately revealed, as it were, a new world of poetry. It burst forth like a spring of clear, cold water, and sparkled with a clarity, breadth and elegance of artistic expression not previously known in Ukrainian writing.""
-
- 
-Gypsy Fortune Teller. 1841. Oil on canvas. Winner of the 1841 Silver Medal at the Imperial Academy of Arts.In 1841, the epic poem Haidamaky was released. In September of 1841, Shevchenko was awarded his third Silver Medal for The Gypsy Fortune Teller. Shevchenko also wrote plays. In 1842, he released a part of the tragedy Nykyta Hayday and in 1843 he completed the drama Nazar Stodolya.
-
-While residing in Saint Petersburg, Shevchenko made three trips to Ukraine, in 1843, 1845, and 1846. The difficult conditions under which his countrymen lived had a profound impact on the poet-painter. Shevchenko visited his still enserfed siblings and other relatives, met with prominent Ukrainian writers and intellectuals such as: Yevhen Hrebinka, Panteleimon Kulish, and Mykhaylo Maksymovych, and was befriended by the princely Repnin family especially Varvara Repnina.
-
-In 1844, distressed by the condition of Ukraine in the Russian Empire, Shevchenko decided to capture some of his homeland's historical ruins and cultural monuments in an album of etchings, which he called Picturesque Ukraine.
-
-
-[edit] Exile
- 
-Self-portrait as a soldier, 1847.On March 22, 1845, the Council of the Academy of Arts granted Shevchenko the title of an artist. He again travelled to Ukraine where he met the historian, Nikolay Kostomarov and other members of the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius, a political society dedicated to the political liberalization of the Empire and transforming it into a federation-like polity of Slavic nations. Upon the society's suppression by the authorities, Shevchenko was arrested along with other members on April 5, 1847. Although he probably was not an official member of the Brotherhood, during the search his poem ""The Dream"" (""Son"") was found. This poem criticized imperial rule, personally attacked Emperor Nicholas I and his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, and therefore was considered extremely inflammatory, and of all the members of the dismantled society Shevchenko was punished most severely.
-
-Shevchenko was sent to prison in Saint Petersburg. He was exiled as a private with the Russian military Orenburg garrison at Orsk, near Orenburg, near the Ural Mountains. Tsar Nicholas I, confirming his sentence, added to it, ""Under the strictest surveillance, without a right to write or paint.""
-
-With the exception of some short periods of his exile, the enforcement of the Tsar's ban on his creative work was lax. The poet produced several drawings and sketches as well as writings while serving and traveling on assignment in the Ural regions and areas on modern Kazakhstan.
-
-But it was not until 1857 that Shevchenko finally returned from exile after receiving a pardon, though he was not permitted to return to St. Petersburg but was ordered to Nizhniy Novgorod. In May of 1859, Shevchenko got permission to move to his native Ukraine. He intended to buy a plot of land not far from the village of Pekariv and settle in Ukraine. In July, he was arrested on a charge of blasphemy, but was released and ordered to return to St. Petersburg.
-
-
-[edit] Death of Shevchenko
- 
-Last self-portrait, 1860.Taras Shevchenko spent the last years of his life working on new poetry, paintings, and engravings, as well as editing his older works. But after his difficult years in exile his final illness proved too much. Shevchenko died in Saint Petersburg on March 10, 1861, the day after his 47th birthday.
-
-He was first buried at the Smolensk Cemetery in Saint Petersburg. However, fulfilling Shevchenko's wish, expressed in his poem ""Testament"" (""Zapovit""), to be buried in Ukraine, his friends arranged to transfer his remains by train to Moscow and then by horse-drawn wagon to his native land. Shevchenko's remains were buried on May 8 on Chernecha Hill (Monk's Hill; now Taras Hill) by the Dnieper River near Kaniv.[1] A tall mound was erected over his grave, now a memorial part of the Kaniv Museum-Preserve.
-
-Dogged by terrible misfortune in love and life, the poet died seven days before the Emancipation of Serfs was announced. His works and life are revered by Ukrainians and his impact on Ukrainian literature is immense.

-100 hryvnias 
-1939 Soviet monument to Taras Shevchenko in Kiev, Ukraine, is located across the Kiev University that bears the poet's name.[2]Taras Shevchenko has a unique place in Ukrainian cultural history and in world literature. His writings formed the foundation for the modern Ukrainian literature to a degree that he is also considered the founder of the modern written Ukrainian language (although Ivan Kotlyarevsky pioneered the literary work in what was close to the modern Ukrainian in the end of the eighteenth century.) Shevchenko's poetry contributed greatly to the growth of Ukrainian national consciousness, and his influence on various facets of Ukrainian intellectual, literary, and national life is still felt to this day. Influenced by Romanticism, Shevchenko managed to find his own manner of poetic expression that encompassed themes and ideas germane to Ukraine and his personal vision of its past and future.
-
-In view of his literary importance, the impact of his artistic work is often missed although his contemporaries valued his artistic work no less, or perhaps even more, than the literary one. A great number of his pictures, drawings and etchings preserved to this day testify for his unique artistic talent. He also experimented with the photography and it is little known that Shevchenko may be considered to have pioneered the art of etching in the Russian Empire (in 1860 he was awarded the title of the Academician in the Imperial Academy of Arts specifically for his achievements in etching.)[3]
-
- 
-Commemorative coin issued in the USSR in 1989 on his 175th anniv.His influence on the Ukrainian culture has been so immense, that even at Soviet times, the official position was to downplay strong Ukrainian nationalism expressed in his poetry, suppressing any mention of it, and to put an emphasis on the social and anti-Tsarist aspects of his legacy, the Class struggle within the Russian Empire. Shevchenko, who himself was born a serf and suffered tremendously for his political views in opposition to the established order of the Empire, was presented in the Soviet times as an internationalist who stood up in general for the plight of the poor classes exploited by the reactionary political regime rather than the vocal proponent of the Ukrainian national idea.
-
-This view is significantly revised in modern independent Ukraine, where he is now viewed as almost an iconic figure with unmatched significance for the Ukrainian nation, a view that has been mostly shared all along by the Ukrainian diaspora that has always revered Shevchenko.
-
-
-[edit] Monuments and memorials
- 
-The ceremonial opening of the monument by the Latvian sculptor Janis Tilbergs to Taras Shevchenko in Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) on December 1, 1918. The inscription says: ""To the great Ukrainian poet-pesant T. G. Shevchenko (1814 - 1861) from the great Russian nation."" The plaster monument existed for only eight years due to the deterioration of the material in the open air. It was planned to be replaced by a bronze version, which never happened.There are many monuments to Shevchenko throughout Ukraine, most notably at his memorial in Kaniv and in the center of Kiev, just across from the Kiev University that bears his name. The Kiev Metro station, Tarasa Shevchenka, is also dedicated to Shevchenko. Among other notable monuments to the poet located throughout Ukraine are the ones in Kharkiv (in front of the Shevchenko Park), Lviv, Luhansk and many others.
-
-Outside of Ukraine, monuments to Shevchenko have been put up in several location of the former USSR associated with his legacy, both in the Soviet and the post-Soviet times. The modern monument in Saint Petersburg was erected on December 22, 2000, but the first monument (pictured) was built in the city in 1918 on the order of Lenin shortly after the Great Russian Revolution. There is also a monument located next to the Shevchenko museum at the square that bears the poet's name in Orsk, Russia (the location of the military garrison where the poet served) where there are also a street, a library and the Pedagogical Institute named to the poet.[4] There are Shevchenko monuments and museums in the cities of Kazakhstan where he was later transferred by the military: Aqtau (the city was named Shevchenko between 1964 and 1992) and nearby Fort Shevchenko (renamed from Fort Alexandrovsky in 1939).
-
-After Ukraine gained its independence in the wake of the 1991 Soviet Collapse, some Ukrainian cities replaced their statues of Lenin with statues of Taras Shevchenko[5] and in some locations that lacked streets named to him, local authorities renamed the streets or squares to Shevchenko, even though these sites usually have little or no connection to his biography. These memorials testify, perhaps, to a greater spirit of patriotism than historical accuracy.
-
-Outside of Ukraine and the former USSR, monuments to Shevchenko have been put up in many countries, usually under the initiative of local Ukrainian diasporas. There are several memorial societies and monuments to him throughout Canada and the United States, most notably a monument in Washington, D.C., near Dupont Circle. There is also a monument in Tipperary Hill in Syracuse, United States, a park named after him in Elmira Heights, N.Y. and a street named after him in New York City's East Village.
-
-The town of Vita in Manitoba, Canada was originally named Shevchenko in his honor. There is a Shevchenko Square in Paris located in the heart of the central Saint-Germain-des-Prés district. The Leo Mol sculpture garden in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, contains many images of Taras Shevchenko.
-
-A two-tonne bronze statue of Shevchenko, located in a memorial park outside of Oakville, Ontario was discovered stolen in December 2006. It was taken for scrap metal; the head was recovered in a damaged state, but the statue was not repairable.
-
-In 2001, the Ukrainian society ""Prosvita"" raised the initiative of building a Church near the Chernecha Mount in Kaniv, where Taras Shevchenko is buried.[6] [7] The initiative got a rather supportive response in the society. Since than many charity events have been held all over the country to gather donations for the above purpose. A marathon under the slogan ""Let’s Build a Church for the Kobzar"" by the First National Radio Channel of Ukraine has collected 39 thousand hryvnias (about 1,600 US dollars) in October, 2003.

+History of Ukraine
+
+Early pre-history
+The first identifiable groups to populate what is now Ukraine were the Neolithic people of the Trypillian culture, followed by the Iranians (Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians), and Goths, among other nomadic peoples who arrived throughout the first millennium BC. During this period, the plains of Scythia were the road for the migration of peoples from Asia into Europe.
+
+Around 600 B.C., the ancient Greeks founded on the north-eastern shore of the Black Sea the colonies of Tyras, Olbia, Hermonassa, perpetuated by Roman and Byzantine cities until the sixth century A.D.
+
+Slavic tribes occupied central and eastern plains of Scythia as early as the sixth century. Around this time the Antes civilization which may have been a largely Slavic nation, occupied much of Ukraine.
+
+ 
+
+
+Kievan Rus'
+In the 9th century, Kiev was conquered from the Khazars by the Varangian (Swedish Viking) Oleg. The Khazars were a Turkic semi-nomadic people from Central Asia who adopted Judaism. They founded the independent Khazar kingdom in the 7th century C.E. in the southeastern part of today's Europe, near the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus. In addition to western Kazakhstan, the Khazar kingdom also included territory in what is now eastern Ukraine, Azerbaijan, southern Russia, and Crimea.
+
+During this time, several Slavic tribes were native to Ukraine, including the Polanians, the Derevlianians, the Severians, the Ulychians, and Tivertsians, and Dulebians. Situated on lucrative trade routes, Kiev among the Polanians quickly prospered as the center of the powerful Slavic/Scandinavian state of Kievan Rus.
+
+In the 11th century, Kievan Rus' was, geographically, the largest state in Europe. During this time, Ukraine became known in the rest of Europe as Ruthenia (the Latin name for Rus', especially after the separation of Russia from Rus' propria). In addition, the name ""Ukraine"" first appears in recorded history on maps of the period. The meaning of term seems to have been synonymous with the land of Rus' propria--the principalities of Kiev, Chernihiv and Pereyaslav. The term, ""Greater Rus' was used to apply to all the lands ruled by Kiev, including those that were not just Slavic, but also Finno-Ugric in the northeast portions of the state. Local regional subdivisions of Rus' appeared in the Slavic heartland, including, ""Belarus'"" (White Ruthenia), ""Chorna Rus'"" (Black Ruthenia) and ""Cherven' Rus'"" (Red Ruthenia) in northwestern and western Ukraine.
+
+Although Christianity had made inroads into Ukraine before the first ecumenical council, the Council of Nicea (particularly along the Black Sea coast) and, in Western Ukraine during the time of empire of Great Moravia, the formal governmental acceptance of Christianity in Rus' occurred at the Baptism of Kiev in 988. The major cause of the Christianization of Ukraine was the Grand-Duke, Volodymyr the Great. His Christian interest was mid-wifed by his grandmother, Princess Olga. Later, an enduring part of the Ukrainian legal tradition was set down by the Kievan ruler, Yaroslav, who promulgated the Russkaya Pravda (Ruthenian Truth) which endured through the Lithuanian period of Rus'.
+
+Conflict among the various principalities of Rus', in spite of the efforts of Grand Prince Vladimir Monomakh, led to decline, beginning in the 12th century. In Rus' propria, the Kiev region, the nascent Ruthenian/Ukrainian principalities of Halych and Volynia extended their rule. In the north, the name of Moscow appeared in the historical record in the principality of Suzdal, which gave rise to the nation of Russia. In the northwest, the principality of Polotsk increasing asserted the autonomy of Belarus'. Kiev was sacked by Russians (1169), Polovtzians and Mongol raiders in the 12th and 13th centuries. Subsequently, all principalities of Ukraine acknowledged dependence upon the Mongols (1239-1240). The Mongol overlordship was very cruel, and people often fled to other countries. Ukrainian settlements appeared in Poland and Hungary.
+
+ 
+
+Halych-Volynia
+The local successor state to Kyivan Rus' on the territory of both Kyiv and today's Ukraine was the principality of Halych-Volynia.
+
+Previously, Volodymyr the Great had established the cities of Halych and Volodymyr Volynski as regional capitals for the western Ukrainian heartland. In the thirteenth century, the city of L'viv eventually became the national capital. This new, more exclusively Ukrainian state was based upon the Dulibian, Tivertsian and Bilyy Khorvaty (White Croatian) tribes. The state was ruled by the descendants of Yaroslav Mudry and Volodymyr Monomakh. For a brief period, the country was ruled by a Hungarian nobleman. Battles with the neighboring states of Poland and Lithuania also occurred, as well as internecine warfare with the independent Ukrainian principality of Chernihiv to the east. The nation reached its peak with the extension of rule to neighboring Wallachia/Bessarabia, all the way to the shores of the Black Sea.
+
+During this period (around 1200-1400) each principality was independent of the other for a period of time. The state of Halych-Volynia eventually became a vassal to the Mongolian Empire, but efforts to gain European support for opposition to the Mongols continued. This period marked the first ""King of Rus'""; previously, the rulers of Rus' were termed, ""Grand Dukes"" or ""Princes.""

+
+Loss of Independence
+During the 14th century, Poland and Lithuania fought wars against the Mongol invaders, and eventually most of Ukraine passed to the rule of Poland and Lithuania. More particularly, the lands of Volynia in the north and northwest passed to the rule of Lithuanian princes, while the south-west passed to the control of Poland (Galicia) and Hungary (Zakarpattya). Most of Ukraine bordered parts of Lithuania, and some say that the name, ""Ukraine"" comes from the local word for ""border,"" although the name ""Ukraine"" was also used centuries earlier. Lithuania took control of the state of Volynia in northern/northwestern Ukraine, including the region around Kyiv (Rus'), and the rulers of Lithuania then adopted the title of ruler of Rus'. Poland took control of the region of Halychyna. Following the union between Poland and Lithuania, Poles, Germans, Armenians and Jews immigrated to the country.
+

+
+The Commonwealth
+After the Union of Lublin in 1569 and the formation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth the gentry of Ukraine voted for membership in the Polish part of the Commonwealth. The period immediately following the creation of the Commmonwealth, saw a huge revitalization in colonisation efforts. Many new cities and villages were founded. New schools spread the ideas of the Renaissance; Polish peasants who arrived in great numbers were quickly Ruthenised; during this time, many Ukrainian nobles became Polonized. Social tensions also grew. Ruthenian/Ukrainian peasants (and some from other nations) who fled efforts to force them into servitude came to be known as Cossacks and earned a reputation for their fierce martial spirit.
+
+
+ 
+The Kozak Era
+The 1648 Ukrainian Kozak (Cossack) rebellion and war of independence (Chmielnicki Uprising), which started an era known in Polish history as The Deluge, undermined the foundations and stability of the Commonwealth. The nascent Cossack Hetmanate, usually viewed as forerunner of the Ukrainian state, found itself in a three-sided military and diplomatic rivalry with the Ottoman Turks, who controlled the Tatars to the south, the Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania, and the rising state of Muscovy to the East. The reconstituted Ukrainian state sought a treaty of protection with Muscovy (the predecessor to the modern Russian state) in 1654. This agreement was known as the Treaty of Pereyaslav. Commonwealth authorities then sought compromise with the Ukrainian Cossack state by signing the Union of Hadyach in 1658, but the agreement was later superseded by 1667 Polish-Russian Treaty of Andrusovo, which divided Ukraine between the Commonwealth and Russia. 
+
+ 
+
+Partitions/Transition to Russian/Austrian Rule
+
+
+Tsarist rule over central Ukraine gradually replaced 'protection' over the subsequent decades. Through the Partitions of Poland Ukraine fell under the control of the Austrians in the extreme west (see: Galicia) and of the Russians elsewhere. Ottoman Empire control receded from south-central Ukraine, while the rule of Hungary over the Trans-Carpathian region continued. Ukrainian writers and intellectuals were inspired by the nationalistic spirit stirring other European peoples existing under other imperial governments and became determined to revive the Ukrainian linguistic and cultural traditions and re-establish a Ukrainian nation-state. The Russians in particular imposed strict limits on attempts to elevate Ukrainian language and culture, even banning its use and study. The fate of the Ukrainians was much more positive under the Austrians. During this time, the people of Ukraine began to accept a change of their name from Rus'/Rusyny (Ruthenia/Ruthenians) to Ukraine/Ukrainians.
+
+ 
+
+
+The 20th Century
+When World War I and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia shattered the Habsburg and Russian empires, Ukrainians declared independent statehood. Between 1917 and 1918, three separate Ukrainian republics manifested independence, including the Rada, the Directorate, the Hetmanate, and the Ukrainian Peoples Republic of Symon Petlura. However, with the failure of the Kiev Operation and the end of Polish-Soviet War, after the Peace of Riga in March 1921, the western part of the traditional territory had been incorporated into Poland, and the larger, central and eastern part became part of the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian SSR.
+
+The Ukrainian national idea persevered during the inter-war years, and Ukrainian culture even enjoyed a revival due to Bolshevik concessions in the early Soviet years. By the late 1920s, however, the Soviet reaction was severe, particularly under Stalin.
+
+To satisfy the state's need for increased food supplies and finance industrialization, Stalin instituted a program of collectivization of agriculture, which profoundly affected Ukraine, breadbasket of the USSR. In the late 1920s and early '30s the state compounded the peasants' lands and animals into collective farms. Starting in 1929 a policy of enforcement was applied, using regular troops and secret police to confiscate lands and material where necessary.
+
+Many resisted, and a desperate struggle of the peasantry against the authorities ensued. Some slaughtered their livestock rather than turn it over to the collectives. Wealthier peasants were labeled ""kulaks"", enemies of the state. Tens of thousands were executed or deported to labour camps.
+
+Forced collectivization had a devastating effect on agricultural productivity. Despite this, in 1932 Stalin increased Ukraine's production quotas by 44%, ensuring that they could not be met. Soviet law required that the members of a collective farm would receive no grain until government quotas were satisfied. The authorities in many instances exacted such high levels of procurement from collective farms that starvation became widespread. At least four million starved to death in a famine, called the Holodomor in Ukrainian.
+
+The Soviet Union suppressed information about the famine, and as late as the 1980s admitted only that there was some hardship because of kulak sabotage and bad weather. Today, its existence is accepted. Some historians consider the famine of 1932–33 to be the necessary consequence of Stalin's program of industrialization and collectivization. Others maintain that the famine was an avoidable, deliberate act of genocide.
+
+After German and Soviet troops invaded Poland in 1939, (see: Polish September Campaign) the western Ukrainian regions were incorporated into the Soviet Union. When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 (see: Operation Barbarossa), many Ukrainians, particularly in the west, welcomed them, but this did not last. In the encirclement battle of Kiev, acclaimed by the Soviets as a Hero City, more than 660,000 Soviet troops were taken captive.
+
+Some elements of the Ukrainian nationalist underground fought both Nazi and Soviet forces. Others initially regarded the Nazis as ""liberators"", and hoped to establish an autonomous Ukrainian state. However, German rule in the occupied territories eventually aided the Soviet cause. Nazi administrators of conquered Soviet territories made little attempt to exploit the population's dissatisfaction with Soviet political and economic policies. Instead, the Nazis divided the territory of Ukraine, preserved the collective-farm system, systematically carried out genocidal policies against Jews, and deported others (mainly Ukrainians) to forced labour in Germany. Under these circumstances, the great majority of the Soviet people fought and worked on their country's behalf, thus ensuring the regime's survival. However, in some regions of Ukraine, resistance against Soviet forces continued as late as the 1950s.
+
+Total civilian losses during the War and German occupation in Ukraine are estimated at 7 million, including over a million Jews shot and killed by the Einsatzgruppen. The great majority fell victim to atrocities, forced labor, and even massacres of whole villages in reprisal for attacks against Nazi forces. Of the estimated 11 million Soviet troops who fell in battle against the Nazis, about a fourth (2.7 million) were ethnic Ukrainians. Thus, the Ukrainian nation is distinguished as one of the first nations to fight the Axis powers in Carpatho-Ukraine and one that saw some of the greatest bloodshed during the War.
+
+ 
+
+
+Independence
+Little changed for Ukraine over the next few decades. During periods of relative liberalization — as under Nikita Khrushchev from 1955 to 1964 — Ukrainian communists pursued national objectives. In the years of perestroika, under U.S.S.R. President Mikhail Gorbachev, national goals were again advanced by Ukrainian officials.
+
+The town of Pripyat, Ukraine was the site of the Chernobyl accident, which occurred in April 26, 1986 when a nuclear plant exploded. The fallout contaminated large areas of northern Ukraine and even parts of Belarus. This spurred on a local independence movement called the Rukh that plagued the Soviet Union during the late 1980s.
+
+Ukraine declared itself an independent state on August 24, 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and was a founding member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). On December 1, 1991 Ukrainian voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum formalizing independence from the Soviet Union.

 Ukrainians generally carry themselves in a very polite, civilized manner. Men often hold the door open for a woman when she enters a building, stand up when a woman enters the room, and, if there is a shortage of seats, men will give up their seats to the women. In rural areas, men will sometimes kiss a woman's hand, but this is starting to go out of fashion.

+[edit] Life
+Franko was born in Nahuevychi, (currently Ivana-Franka) in Austrian-controlled eastern Galicia, today part of the Lviv Oblast (province of Ukraine), and was the son of a village blacksmith, of German ancestry. The family's original surname was Frank. He attended school in the village Yasenycia Silna from 1862 until 1864, and from there attended a Basilian monastic school in Drohobych until 1867. In 1875, he graduated from the Drohobych gymnasium, and continued on to Lviv University, where he studied classical philosophy and Ukrainian language and literature. It was at this University that Franko began his literary career, with various works of poetry and his novel Petriï i Dovbushchuky published by the students' magazine Druh (Friend), whose editorial board he would later join.
+
+ 
+The grave of Ivan Franko in the Lychakivskiy Cemetery in Lviv, Ukraine.Ivan Franko was introduced to Mykhailo Drahomanov at Lviv University, with whom he shared a long political and literary association. His socialist political writings, along with his association with Drahomanov, resulted in Franko's arrest in 1877 along with, among others, Mykhailo Pavlyk and Ostap Terletsky. They were accused of belonging to a secret socialist organization, which did not exist. However, the eight months in prison did not discourage his political writings and activities. In prison, Franko wrote the satire Smorhonska Akademiya (The Smorhon Academy). After release, he studied the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, contributed articles to the Polish newspaper Praca and helped organize workers' groups in Lviv. In 1878 Franko and Pavlyk founded the magazine Hromads'kyi Druh. Only two issues were published before it was banned by the government; however, the journal was reborn under the names Dzvin and Molot. Franko published a series of books called Dribna Biblioteka from 1878 until his second arrest for arousing the peasants to civil disobedience in 1880. After three months in the Kolomyia prison, the writer returned to Lviv. His impressions of this exile are enumerated in his novel Na Dni (On the Bottom). Upon his release, Franko was kept under police surveillance. At odds with the administration, Franko was expelled from the Lviv University that would be renamed Ivan Franko National University of Lviv after the writer's death.
+
+Franko was an active contributor to the journal Swit (The World) in 1881. He wrote more than half of the material, excluding the unsigned editorials. Later that year, Franko moved to his native Nahuevychi where he wrote the novel Zakhar Berkut, translated Goethe's Faust and Heine's poem Deutschland: ein Wintermärchen into Ukrainian. He also wrote a series of articles on Taras Shevchenko, and reviewed the collection Khutorna Poeziya by P. Kulish. Franko worked for the journal Zorya (Sunrise), and became a member of the editing board of the newspaper Dilo (Action) a year later.
+
+He married Olha Khorunzhynska in May 1886, to whom he dedicated the collection Z vershyn i nyzhyn (From Hills and Valleys), a book of poetry and verse. His wife was to later suffer from a debilitating mental illness, one of the reasons that Franko would not leave Lviv for treatment in Kiev in 1916, shortly before his death.
+
+In 1888 Franko was a contributor to the journal Pravda, which, along with his association with compatriots from Dnieper Ukraine, led to a third arrest in 1889. After this two-month prison term, he co-founded the Ruthenian-Ukrainian Radical Party with Mykhailo Drahomanov and Mykhailo Pavlyk. Franko was the Radical party's candidate for seats in the Parliament of Austria-Hungary and the Galicia Diet, but never won an election.
+
+In 1891, Franko attended Chernivtsi University (where he prepared a dissertation on Ivan Vyshensky), and afterwards attended Vienna University to defend a doctoral dissertation on the spiritual romance Barlaam and Josaphat under the supervision of Vatroslav Jagić, who was considered the foremost expert of Slavic languages at the time. Franko was appointed lecturer in the history of Ukrainian literature at Lviv University in 1894; however, he was not able to chair the Department of Ukrainian literature there because of opposition from Vicegerent Kazimierz Badeni and Galician conservative circles.
+

+Ivan Franko statue in front of the Lviv University.One of his articles, Sotsiializm i sotsiial-demokratyzm (Socialism and Social Democracy), a severe criticism of Ukrainian Social Democracy and the socialism of Marx and Engels, was published in 1898 in the journal Zhytie I Slovo, which he and his wife founded. He continued his anti-Marxist stance in a collection of poetry entitled Mii izmarahd (My Emerald) in 1898, where he called Marxism ""a religion founded on dogmas of hatred and class struggle."" His long time collaborative association with Mykhailo Drahomanov were strained due to their diverging views on socialism and the national question. Franko would later accuse Drahomanov of tying Ukraine's fate to that of Russia in Suspil'nopolitychni pohliady M. Drahomanova (The Sociopolitical Views of M. Drahomanov), published in 1906. After a split in the Radical Party, in 1899, Franko, together with the Lviv historian, Mykhailo Hrushevsky, founded the National Democratic Party where he worked until 1904, when he retired from political life.
+
+In 1902 students and activists in Lviv, embarrassed that Franko was living in poverty, purchased a house for him in the city. He lived there for the remaining 14 years of his life. The house is now the site of the Ivan Franko Museum.
+
+In 1914, his jubilee collection, Pryvit Ivanovi Frankovi (Greeting Ivan Franko), and the collection Iz lit moyeyi molodosti (From the Years of My Youth) were published.
+
+
+[edit] Death
+He died in poverty at 4 p.m. on May 28, 1916. Those who came to pay their respects saw him lying on the table covered with nothing but a ragged sheet. His burial and burial-clothes were paid for by his admirers, and none of his family came to visit him.
+
+These events caused Heinrich Wigeleiser of the Academic Gymnasium to tell his Ukrainian students:
+
+“ ""Go and see him lying – as poor as your entire nation is. You did not prize him when he was alive and you do not prize him now, when he is dead"" ” 
+
+Franko was buried at the Lychakivskiy Cemetery in Lviv.

After this two-month prison term, he co-founded the Ruthenian-Ukrainian Radical Party with Mykhailo Drahomanov and Mykhailo Pavlyk. Franko was the Radical party's candidate for seats in the Parliament of Austria-Hungary and the Galicia Diet, but never won an election.
-
-In 1891, Franko attended Chernivtsi University (where he prepared a dissertation on Ivan Vyshensky), and afterwards attended Vienna University to defend a doctoral dissertation on the spiritual romance Barlaam and Josaphat under the supervision of Vatroslav Jagić, who was considered the foremost expert of Slavic languages at the time. Franko was appointed lecturer in the history of Ukrainian literature at Lviv University in 1894; however, he was not able to chair the Department of Ukrainian literature there because of opposition from Vicegerent Kazimierz Badeni and Galician conservative circles.
-
- 
-Ivan Franko statue in front of the Lviv University.One of his articles, Sotsiializm i sotsiial-demokratyzm (Socialism and Social Democracy), a severe criticism of Ukrainian Social Democracy and the socialism of Marx and Engels, was published in 1898 in the journal Zhytie I Slovo, which he and his wife founded. He continued his anti-Marxist stance in a collection of poetry entitled Mii izmarahd (My Emerald) in 1898, where he called Marxism ""a religion founded on dogmas of hatred and class struggle."" His long time collaborative association with Mykhailo Drahomanov were strained due to their diverging views on socialism and the national question. Franko would later accuse Drahomanov of tying Ukraine's fate to that of Russia in Suspil'nopolitychni pohliady M. Drahomanova (The Sociopolitical Views of M. Drahomanov), published in 1906. After a split in the Radical Party, in 1899, Franko, together with the Lviv historian, Mykhailo Hrushevsky, founded the National Democratic Party where he worked until 1904, when he retired from political life.
-
-In 1902 students and activists in Lviv, embarrassed that Franko was living in poverty, purchased a house for him in the city. He lived there for the remaining 14 years of his life. The house is now the site of the Ivan Franko Museum.
-
-In 1914, his jubilee collection, Pryvit Ivanovi Frankovi (Greeting Ivan Franko), and the collection Iz lit moyeyi molodosti (From the Years of My Youth) were published.
-
-
-[edit] Death
-He died in poverty at 4 p.m. on May 28, 1916. Those who came to pay their respects saw him lying on the table covered with nothing but a ragged sheet. His burial and burial-clothes were paid for by his admirers, and none of his family came to visit him.
-
-These events caused Heinrich Wigeleiser of the Academic Gymnasium to tell his Ukrainian students:
-
-“ ""Go and see him lying – as poor as your entire nation is. You did not prize him when he was alive and you do not prize him now, when he is dead"" ” 
-
-Franko was buried at the Lychakivskiy Cemetery in Lviv.

-
-[edit] Literary Works
- 
-One of the many portraits of Ivan Franko by Ukranian impressionist artist Ivan Trush.In 1876, Lesyshyna Cheliad and Dva Pryiateli (Two Friends) were published in the literary almanac Dnistrianka. Later that year he wrote his first collection of poetry, Ballads and Tales. His first of the stories in the Boryslaw series were published in 1877.
-
-Franko depicted the harsh experience of Ukrainian workers and peasants in his novels Boryslaw Laughs (1881-1882) and Boa Constrictor (1878). His works deal with Ukrainian nationalism and history (Zakhar Berkut, 1883), social issues (Basis of Society, 1895 and Withered Leaves, 1896), and philosophy (Semper Tiro, 1906).
-
-He has drawn parallels to the Israelite search for a homeland and the Ukrainian desire for independence in In Death of Cain (1889) and Moses (1905). Stolen Happiness (1893) is considered as his best dramatic masterpiece. In total, Franko has written more than 1,000 works.",Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/Victorpoop|Victorpoop]] ([[User talk:Victorpoop|talk]]) to last version by TravisTX,Elipongo,2008-04-29T00:23:53Z,"Removed a significant section about Ivan Franko, including his biography, literary works, and details of his death.

-{{main|Ukrainian cuisine|Ukrainian wine}}
-
-[[Food]] is an important part to the Ukrainian culture.  Special foods are used at [[Easter]] as well as [[Christmas]], that are not made at any other time of the year. At Christmas time, for example, ''[[kutia]]'' - a mixture of cooked buckwheat groats, poppy seeds, and honey, and special sweet breads - is prepared.
-
-An average Ukrainian diet consists of fish, cheeses and a variety of sausages. [[Head cheese]] is also quite popular in Ukraine as well as Kovbasa, a type of sausage. Typically bread is a core part of every meal, and must be included for the meal to be ""complete.""  At Christmas time, for example, it is tradition to have a [[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|twelve-course meal]]. Included at Easter are the famous [[pysanky]] (coloured and patterned eggs). Making these eggs is a long process, and they are not actually eaten, but displayed in the centre of the table (usually around the bread).
-
-Ukrainians often toast to good health, linger over their meal, and engage in lively conversation with family and friends. Often they will drink tea (''[[chai]]''), wine, or coffee afterwards with a simple dessert, such as a fruit pastry.
-
-===Best-known foods===
-* [[Salo (food)|Salo]] (salted pork fat with garlic)
-* [[Borshch]] (a vegetable based soup, usually with beets and beef or pork meat)
-* [[Holubtsi]] (cabbage rolls stuffed with rice and meat usually)
-* [[Varenyky]] (stuffed dumplings, also known as [[perogies]] or pyrohy)
-* [[Pampushky]] (a fried, dessert version of varenyky, filled with fruit instead of meat or cheese)
-
-==Dance==
-{{main|Ukrainian dance}}
-
-A Ukrainian style of dancing is called [[Kalyna]]. Both men and women participate in this type of dancing. 
-
-* The women wear colourful costumes, sometimes featuring a solid-coloured (usually blue, green, red, or black) tunic and matching apron, and under that an open skirt, and below that a white skirt with an embroidered hem that should reach an inch or so below the knee. If they wear a tunic, then under that they wear a long-sleeved richly [[Ukrainian embroidery|embroidered]] white shirt. Traditionally, women wear a type of red leather boots to dance in. They also wear a beautiful flower head piece ([[vinok]]), that is a headband covered with flowers and has long flowing ribbons down the back that flow when they dance, and plain red coral necklaces.
-* The men wear baggy pants (usually blue, white, black or red) and a shirt (usually white, but sometimes black) embroidered at the neck and down the stomach. Over the shirt they sometimes will wear a richly embroidered vest. Around their waist they wear a thick sash with fringed ends. Like the women, they wear boots, but these can be black or white in addition to red.
-* Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the [[previtanya]], is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with salt on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].

-==Weddings==
-{{main|Ukrainian wedding traditions}}
-Weddings traditionally take place in churches, the bride in white and the groom in black. Wedding celebrations are known to continue for days, even a week. They are accompanied by lively music and dancing, drinking and eating, and fellowship. 
-Some particular wedding customs include:
-
-* Before the wedding, the groom goes with his friends to the bride's house and bargains with ""money' to get a bride from her family. 
-* When leaving the church, the bride carries a basket of candies or sweets to throw to children and the crowd
-* The groom carries her down any stairs
-* At the reception, the bride dances with each of the unmarried women present, and places a special veil on each of them. This veil symbolises that they are still pure, but that the bride hopes they will get married soon. She also throws a bunch of flowers and the girl who catches it first will likely be the next to marry.

 * At the reception, the bride dances with each of the unmarried women present, and places a special veil on each of them. This veil symbolises that they are still pure, but that the bride hopes they will get married soon. She also throws a bunch of flowers and the girl who catches it first will likely be the next to marry.
 
+== Humor ==
+Ukrainian humor often deals with Ukrainian everyday life, Russians (often referred to as ""[[Moskal]]i,"") other [[Minority group|ethnic minorities]] and Ukrainians themselves. A majority of jokes make fun of stereotypical ethnic features.
+
+Below is a typical example of a Ukrainian joke. It portraits Ukrainians as greedy and [[Salo (food)|salo]]-loving.
+  A [[Moskal]] comes to a Ukrainian who is eating [[Salo (food)|salo]].
+  -""Give me some salo, I'm starving!"" says the Moskal.
+  -""First drink a bucket of water, and then you may have some,"" replies the Ukrainian.
+  The Moskal barely finishes the bucket and sets it down.
+  ""Now you may have some"" the Ukrainian says.
+  ""Oh God, no, I'm full!""
+  ""See? You really were thirsty, not hungry.""
+
+Another one shows the people's discontent with their political leaders:
+  [[Lukashenko]] and [[Putin]] are flying on an airplane.
+  Putin asks Lukashenko, ""Which nation do you think would mourn more for their leader more should this plane crash?""
+  ""The Ukrainians,"" Lukashenko quickly replies.
+  -""Why is that?""
+  -""[[Kuchma]] isn't traveling with us.""
+
+Some Ukrainian jokes are based on [[word play]]. Here is an example:
+  A terrorist with an automatic rifle storms into [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukrainian parliament) and yells,
+  -""Excuse me, allow me to interrupt you.""
+  -""Go ahead.""
+  ''The person that's telling the joke imitates gunshot sounds''
+
+The pun here, is that the word '''""to interrupt""''' is the same in Ukrainian as the word '''""to kill off.""'''
+It is also worth mentioning that the Ukrainian parliament sessions sometimes end up in fistfights and for one group of people to be yelling while someone else is speaking or giving a speech is not at all uncommon.

 Ukrainians generally carry themselves in a very polite, civilized manner. Men often hold the door open for a woman when she enters a building, stand up when a woman enters the room, and, if there is a shortage of seats, men will give up their seats to the women. In rural areas, men will sometimes kiss a woman's hand, but this is starting to go out of fashion.

+==Cultural differences between Ukrainians and Russians==
+
+Ukrainians are completely different from Russians - Ukrainians have totally different Western-style culture and European mentality.
+
+Speaking from a neutral viewpoint, Ukraine (Europe) is located at the very heart of Europe and it has a century- long tradition of Western-style culture, tolerance, Western-style democracy and rule of law.
+
+Russians invaded Ukraine in the XVII century and they tried to force Western-leaning democratic Ukrainians to adopt the Russian mentality. But all Ukrainians said ""No!"". Ukrainians fought bravely in many wars to free themselves from the Russian yoke.
+
+They won their struggle in 1991, Ukrainians defeated the communist oppressive regime of the USSR (also called the ""Soviet Union""). The victory of Ukrainians meant the end of the evil Soviet Union empire and Euro-Atlantic freedoms for the Ukrainians!
+
+Ukraine is now working to join European Union, NATO and many other Western-style Euro-Atlantic organizations. Ukrainians are no less pro-Western and civilized that Poles, Romanians, or even Belgians!

+==Cultural differences between Ukrainians and Russians==
+
+Ukrainians are completely different from Russians - Ukrainians have totally different Western-style culture and European mentality.
+
+Speaking from a neutral viewpoint, Ukraine (Europe) is located at the very heart of Europe and it has a century- long tradition of Western-style culture, tolerance, Western-style democracy and rule of law.
+
+Russians invaded Ukraine in the XVII century and they tried to force Western-leaning democratic Ukrainians to adopt the Russian mentality. But all Ukrainians said ""No!"". Ukrainians fought bravely in many wars to free themselves from the Russian yoke.
+
+They won their struggle in 1991, Ukrainians defeated the communist oppressive regime of the USSR (also called the ""Soviet Union""). The victory of Ukrainians meant the end of the evil Soviet Union empire and Euro-Atlantic freedoms for the Ukrainians!
+
+Ukraine is now working to join European Union, NATO and many other Western-style Euro-Atlantic organizations. Ukrainians are no less pro-Western and civilized that Poles, Romanians, or even Belgians!

If they wear a tunic, then under that they wear a long-sleeved richly [[Ukrainian embroidery|embroidered]] white shirt. Traditionally, women wear a type of red leather boots to dance in. They also wear a flower head piece ([[vinok]]), that is a headband covered with flowers and has long flowing ribbons down the back that flow when they dance, and plain red coral necklaces.

 * Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the [[pryvitannia]], is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with salt on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].

-== Humor ==
-Ukrainian humor often deals with Ukrainian everyday life, Russians (often referred to as ""[[Moskal]]i,"") other [[Minority group|ethnic minorities]] and Ukrainians themselves. A majority of jokes make fun of stereotypical ethnic features.
-
-Below is a typical example of a Ukrainian joke.
-  A [[Moskal]] comes to a Ukrainian who is eating [[Salo (food)|salo]].
-  -""Give me some salo, I'm starving!"" says the Moskal.
-  -""First drink a bucket of water, and then you may have some,"" replies the Ukrainian.
-  The Moskal barely finishes the bucket and sets it down.
-  ""Now you may have some"" the Ukrainian says.
-  ""Oh God, no, I'm full!""
-  ""See? You really were thirsty, not hungry.""
-
-Another one shows the people's discontent with their political leaders:
-  [[Lukashenko]] and [[Putin]] are flying on an airplane.
-  Putin asks Lukashenko, ""Which nation do you think would mourn more for their leader more 
-  should this plane crash?""
-  - ""The Ukrainians,"" Lukashenko quickly replies.
-  -""Why is that?""
-  -""[[Kuchma]] isn't traveling with us.""
-
-Some Ukrainian jokes are based on [[word play]]. Here is an example:
-  A terrorist with an automatic rifle storms into [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukrainian parliament) and yells,
-  -""Excuse me, allow me to interrupt you.""
-  -""Go ahead.""
-  ''The person that's telling the joke imitates gunshot sounds''
-
-The pun here, is that the word '''""to interrupt""''' is the same in Ukrainian as the word '''""to kill off.""'''
-It is also worth mentioning that the Ukrainian parliament sessions sometimes end up in fistfights and for one group of people to be yelling while someone else is speaking or giving a speech is not at all uncommon.

-
-[[Food]] is an important part to the Ukrainian culture.  Special foods are used at [[Easter]] as well as [[Christmas]], that are not made at any other time of the year. At Christmas time, for example, ''[[kutia]]'' - a mixture of cooked wheat groats, [[poppy seed]]s, and honey, and special sweet breads - is prepared.
-
-An average Ukrainian diet consists of fish, cheeses and a variety of sausages. [[Head cheese]] is also quite popular in Ukraine as well as Kolbasa ({{lang-ua|Ковбаса́, ''Kovbasa''}}), a type of sausage. Typically bread is a core part of every meal, and must be included for the meal to be ""complete.""  At Christmas time, for example, it is tradition to have a [[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|twelve-course meal]]. Included at Easter are the famous [[pysanky]] (coloured and patterned eggs). Making these eggs is a long process, and they are not actually eaten, but displayed in the centre of the table (usually around the bread).
-
-Ukrainians often toast to good health, linger over their meal, and engage in lively conversation with family and friends. Often they will drink tea (''[[chai]]''), wine, or coffee afterwards with a simple dessert, such as a fruit pastry.

-==Dance==
-{{Main|Ukrainian dance}}
-
-Traditional dances are popular within Ukraine, many of which derive from rural [[Cossack]] villages.<ref name=""ukraine1""/>
-
-One Ukrainian style of dancing is called [[Kalyna]]. Both men and women participate in this type of dancing. 
-
-* The women wear colourful costumes, sometimes featuring a solid-coloured (usually blue, green, red, or black) tunic and matching apron, and under that an open skirt, and below that a white skirt with an embroidered hem that should reach an inch or so below the knee. If they wear a tunic, then under that they wear a long-sleeved richly [[Ukrainian embroidery|embroidered]] white shirt. Traditionally, women wear a type of red leather boots to dance in. They also wear a flower head piece ([[vinok]]), that is a headband covered with flowers and has long flowing ribbons down the back that flow when they dance, and plain red coral necklaces.
-* The men wear baggy trousers (usually blue, white, black or red) and a shirt (usually white, but sometimes black) embroidered at the neck and down the stomach. Over the shirt they sometimes will wear a richly embroidered vest. Around their waist they wear a thick sash with fringed ends. Like the women, they wear boots, but these can be black or white in addition to red.
-* Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the [[pryvitannia]], is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with salt on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].

-Weddings traditionally take place in churches, the bride in white and the groom in black. Wedding celebrations are known to continue for days, even a week. They are accompanied by lively music and dancing, drinking and eating, and fellowship.

-
-* Before the wedding, the groom goes with his friends to the bride's house  each of them. This veil symbolises that they are still pure, but that the bride hopes they will get married soon. She also throws her veil and the girl who catches it first will likely be the next to marry.

+==Traditional dresses and weaving==
+Ukrainian traditional dresses are mostly fabricated out of hand-weaved tissues. These are typically adorned with designs in red, blue or black colors <ref>[http://ua-travelling.com/en/article/Ukraine-clothes]</ref>. Only in the village of Krupove ([[Rivne Oblast]]) the art of [[weaving]] is still practiced on handmade, wooden looms, today. A large number of artisanal crafts are fabricated by its local population. Many people in the village master the art of traditional tissue production such as the weaving and embroidering of national dresses and suits. In most families this knowledge has been passed from generation to generation.
+Krupove is also the native village of two celebrated personalities in the sector of tissue production. Uliana Petrivna <ref>[http://storinka-m.kiev.na/article.php?id=478]</ref> and Nina Myhailivna <ref>[http://www.rv.gov.ua/sitenew/main/ua/1160.htm]</ref> have made very important and internationally recognized contributions to the maintenance of Ukrainian culture.

+
+==Cuisine==
+{{main|Ukrainian cuisine|Ukrainian wine}}
+
+[[Food]] is an important part to the Ukrainian culture.  Special foods are used at [[Easter]] as well as [[Christmas]], that are not made at any other time of the year. At Christmas time, for example, ''[[kutia]]'' - a mixture of cooked wheat groats, [[poppy seed]]s, and honey, and special sweet breads - is prepared.
+
+An average Ukrainian diet consists of fish, cheeses and a variety of sausages. [[Head cheese]] is also quite popular in Ukraine as well as Kolbasa ({{lang-ua|Ковбаса́, ''Kovbasa''}}), a type of sausage. Typically bread is a core part of every meal, and must be included for the meal to be ""complete.""  At Christmas time, for example, it is tradition to have a [[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|twelve-course meal]]. Included at Easter are the famous [[pysanky]] (coloured and patterned eggs). Making these eggs is a long process, and they are not actually eaten, but displayed in the centre of the table (usually around the bread).
+
+Ukrainians often toast to good health, linger over their meal, and engage in lively conversation with family and friends. Often they will drink tea (''[[chai]]''), wine, or coffee afterwards with a simple dessert, such as a fruit pastry.
+
+Popular foods in Ukraine include, [[Salo (food)|Salo]], [[Borshch]] (national soup),<ref name=autogenerated1 /> [[Cabbage roll]], [[Chicken Kiev]], <ref name=autogenerated1 /> [[Vareniki]], [[Pączki]] and [[Crêpe]].
+
+==Dance==
+{{Main|Ukrainian dance}}
+
+Traditional dances are popular within Ukraine, many of which derive from rural [[Cossack]] villages.<ref name=""ukraine1""/>
+
+One Ukrainian style of dancing is called [[Kalyna]]. Both men and women participate in this type of dancing. 
+
+* The women wear colourful costumes, sometimes featuring a solid-coloured (usually blue, green, red, or black) tunic and matching apron, and under that an open skirt, and below that a white skirt with an embroidered hem that should reach an inch or so below the knee. If they wear a tunic, then under that they wear a long-sleeved richly [[Ukrainian embroidery|embroidered]] white shirt. Traditionally, women wear a type of red leather boots to dance in. They also wear a flower head piece ([[vinok]]), that is a headband covered with flowers and has long flowing ribbons down the back that flow when they dance, and plain red coral necklaces.
+* The men wear baggy trousers (usually blue, white, black or red) and a shirt (usually white, but sometimes black) embroidered at the neck and down the stomach. Over the shirt they sometimes will wear a richly embroidered vest. Around their waist they wear a thick sash with fringed ends. Like the women, they wear boots, but these can be black or white in addition to red.
+* Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the [[pryvitannia]], is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with salt on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].
+
+==Weddings==
+{{main|Ukrainian wedding traditions}}
+Weddings traditionally take place in churches, the bride in white and the groom in black. Wedding celebrations are known to continue for days, even a week. They are accompanied by lively music and dancing, drinking and eating, and fellowship. 
+Some particular wedding customs include:
+
+* Before the wedding, the groom goes with his friends to the bride's house and bargains with ""money' to get a bride from her family. 
+* When leaving the church, the bride carries a basket of candies or sweets to throw to children and the crowd
+* The groom carries her down any stairs
+* At the reception, the bride dances with each of the unmarried women present, and places a special veil on each of them. This veil symbolises that they are still pure, but that the bride hopes they will get married soon. She also throws her veil and the girl who catches it first will likely be the next to marry.

 ''LIGHT, LUCIDITY AND FREEDOM''
 
-The city of Odessa is arguably the most important artistic centre in the Ukraine. Its landscape stands firmly within the artist's field of vision, transformed into a creative image by figurative experiment. Indeed, with its spectacular topography and pan-meditteranean, Odessa has long been an inspriation to the great painters, who exploit the bright sun filled colours of the Odessa landscape. Odessa painters are able to capture the purest elements of art, exploiting not just the airy brightness typical of the city but also the rectilinear and cursive shapes of rock formations along the shores of the Black Sea and even the expanse of the shoreline repeated in horizontal stripes on their canvasses.

Odessa painters are able to capture the purest elements of art, exploiting not just the airy brightness typical of the city but also the rectilinear and cursive shapes of rock formations along the shores of the Black Sea and even the expanse of the shoreline repeated in horizontal stripes on their canvasses.
 The importance of light in their work can not be overstressed. The unique qualities of light on the Black Sea shore have caused artists working their to deploy a diversity of spacial solutions and to develop special notions of plasticity to convey volumes and outlines. Formal experiment with light developed during the 1970's in contrast to the deepening gloom of social reality and the slow decline of national consciousnes; the works of Odessa artists more and more are imbued with the strongest sensations of purifying, cleansing sunlight in all its depth. One Ukrainian painter in the 1970's defined her aesthetic credo as: 'light, lucidity and freedom'
 
 '''""The Specific Characteristics of The Odessa Group""'''
 
-There is a strong folkloric tendency in Odessa art and an awareness of the Black Sea's ancient cultures. One ritual characteristic is the ubiquitous female form. Totemistic 'stone women' are plentiful on the steppes of the Ukraine and in the museums of Odessa and contemporary Ukranian art reflects this. The woman is invoked to protect even the modern artist. She is the original source of life whether mother or mother-earth, both stone goddess and contemporary icon. The woman has become the symbol of a primeval deity, invoked to protect the work and lending it a spiritual (pre-Christian) intensity. She can be an angel, lover, mother-earth or goddess but always a woman.

She can be an angel, lover, mother-earth or goddess but always a woman.
 
 Characteristically, Odessa art is non-literary and rejects narrative implication. These artists strive for the purity of the image, with an emphasis on decorativeness and on a specifically painterly professionalism. Formal experiment often leads to metaphysical flight and aesthetic rebellion is confined within the frame of the painting without reference to any social theories. There is an implicitly optimistic psyche motivating the creative energy of the artists. It is a psyche in which there is no room for fatalistic notions.

+""Art has never been unchangeable. It is evident that Ukrainian art could not grow stiff. As far back as the revolution, we had Futurists and Constructivists and Cubists. All that was choked from above.""
+M. Butovych. New York. 1956
+
+In 1963, the destroyer of Ukrainian Avant-garde, art critic Kuriltseva, complacently summed up the results of her activities: ""Where have the once notorious Bohomazov and the Pastukhov brothers vanished? They disappeared from art without trace, as if they had never existed.""*
+
+Her generation triumphed: Khrushchev himself headed the struggle against abstractionism and other 'isms/ They persecuted leftists for decades, killed the Boichukists, in 1937, in the People's Commissariat for Public Education, burnt down portraits of 'the enemies of the people' painted by Petrytsky, cut paintings by Sedlyar, Shekhtman and Hvozdyk in the Kyiv Museum of Russian Art, in 1952, passed death sentences to canvases by Palmov, Bohomazov and others in the Museum of Ukrainian Fine Arts, and, in the same year, destroyed works by Arkhypenko, Kovzhun and Narbut in Lviv, and fired Yermylov and Synyakova from the Artists Union for their pro-Western moods.
+
+Meanwhile, the youth of the 1960s tried to find information on Ukrainian Avant-garde art and discovered a hot mainland of Ukrainian art history. They sought out the survived Boichukists and Constructivists Pavlenko, Yermylov, Bizyukov, Vrona, Pecharkovska, Kolos, and the widows and relatives of the deceased Bohomazova, Petrytska, Redko, Zhdanko, Khvostenko, and Manevych. They searched in the funds, archives and libraries. They also informed collectors Sigalov, Ivakin, Sveshnikov and Lobanov-Rostovsky, as well as consulted with researchers from Moscow, Leningrad, Warsaw, Paris, and the USA. They risked their careers and freedom to penetrate Ukrainian diaspora 'In search of the time past.""
+
+A counter current of interest was from Western art historians, specializing in Russian art, who told each other ""Go to Kyiv, there is Bohomazov."" As it turned out, the roots of Russian Avant-garde could be found in Ukraine. For example, what was Goncharova's paintings inspired with? — the Polovtsian stone images on the steppes of Ukraine. Which cities were associated with the life and work of the Futurist and trans-rationalist Terentyev? — Kherson, Kharkiv, Odessa and Dnipropetrovsk. Why did Malevych make such frequent mentions of Pymonenko and ""the famous master from Chernihiv, Murashko"" in the last years of his life? What does the title of Exter's painting, Fundukleyivska at Night, mean? How can you explain why Davyd Burlyuk called himself a 'Tartar-Za-porozhian Futurist'? How did it happen that Matyushin, prohibited in Leningrad, was readily published in Kharkiv?
+
+Deciding these questions, some Western historians of Russian art became historians of Ukrainian Avant-garde as well (the Marcades — France, Boiko — Poland, Bowlt — the USA, Nakov — France, Mudrak — the USA).
+
+Furthermore, well-known London art collector, Mr. Lobanov-Rostovsky, collects sketches by stage designers of the Kyiv school, Exter, Meller, Petrytsky, Khvostov, Rabynovych, Tyshler and Chelishchev. At the 1988 exhibition of his collection of paintings in Moscow, he told me with conviction: 'You must write a book on five uniquely gifted Ukrainian artists: Arkhypenko, Bohomazov, Exter, Yermylov and Petrytsky."" I gladly consented to this proposition adding to the list some more names — Malevych, Palmov, Tatlin, Burlyuk and Boichuk. These are the great names around which dozens of students and adherents grouped establishing various art trends, schools and currents. Through them, Ukrainian culture was rapidly Europeanized, while in Europe and America it began to breathe with Rus-Ukraine. Unfortunately, Stalin's terror cut off informatbn of Ukrainian art to the world.
+
+...The notion 'Ukrainian Avant-garde' was introduced by Paris art critic, Nakov, in reference to the exhibition, Tatlin's Dream, held in London in 1973. For the first time ever, the West saw world-class works by Yermylov and Bohomazov, two obscure Avant-gardists from Ukraine. Their works brought to mind the names of world-famous masters whose origin, education, self-perception and national traditions were linked with Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, Odessa and with the Ukrainian cultural tradition in general. Among them were Burlyuk, ""the most faithful son of Ukraine,"" the Pole, Malevych, who considered himself to be a Ukrainian; Tatlin, professor of the Kyiv Art Institute and bandura-player; Exter, the founder of the Ukrainian school of constructivist stage design. And lastly, Arkhypenko, who was inspired by his indelible impressions of his homeland, the magic of the Tripillya civilizatbn. the archaic Polovtsian stone images, the resonant contours of mosaics in the St. Sophia of Kyiv and reliefs of St. Michael's Cathedral of the Golden Domes, and the colours of folk ceramics.

+LIGHT, LUCIDITY AND FREEDOM
+
+The city of Odessa is arguably the most important artistic centre in the Ukraine. Its landscape stands firmly within the artist's field of vision, transformed into a creative image by figurative experiment. Indeed, with its spectacular topography and pan-meditteranean, Odessa has long been an inspriation to the great painters, who exploit the bright sun filled colours of the Odessa landscape. Odessa painters are able to capture the purest elements of art, exploiting not just the airy brightness typical of the city but also the rectilinear and cursive shapes of rock formations along the shores of the Black Sea and even the expanse of the shoreline repeated in horizontal stripes on their canvasses.
+The importance of light in their work can not be overstressed. The unique qualities of light on the Black Sea shore have caused artists working their to deploy a diversity of spacial solutions and to develop special notions of plasticity to convey volumes and outlines. Formal experiment with light developed during the 1970's in contrast to the deepening gloom of social reality and the slow decline of national consciousnes; the works of Odessa artists more and more are imbued with the strongest sensations of purifying, cleansing sunlight in all its depth. One Ukrainian painter in the 1970's defined her aesthetic credo as: 'light, lucidity and freedom'
+
+""The Specific Characteristics of The Odessa Group""
+
+There is a strong folkloric tendency in Odessa art and an awareness of the Black Sea's ancient cultures. One ritual characteristic is the ubiquitous female form. Totemistic 'stone women' are plentiful on the steppes of the Ukraine and in the museums of Odessa and contemporary Ukranian art reflects this. The woman is invoked to protect even the modern artist. She is the original source of life whether mother or mother-earth, both stone goddess and contemporary icon. The woman has become the symbol of a primeval deity, invoked to protect the work and lending it a spiritual (pre-Christian) intensity. She can be an angel, lover, mother-earth or goddess but always a woman.
+
+Characteristically, Odessa art is non-literary and rejects narrative implication. These artists strive for the purity of the image, with an emphasis on decorativeness and on a specifically painterly professionalism. Formal experiment often leads to metaphysical flight and aesthetic rebellion is confined within the frame of the painting without reference to any social theories. There is an implicitly optimistic psyche motivating the creative energy of the artists. It is a psyche in which there is no room for fatalistic notions.
+
+Whether in exile in Munich, New York or Washington, in internal exile in Moscow, or living in Odessa, these artists have remained true to their century-long traditions of formal pictorial experiment.

 '''""The Specific Characteristics of The Odessa Group""'''
 
-There is a strong folkloric tendency in Odessa art and an awareness of the Black Sea's ancient cultures. One ritual characteristic is the ubiquitous female form. Totemistic 'stone women' are plentiful on the steppes of the Ukraine and in the museums of Odessa and contemporary Ukrainian art reflects this. The woman is invoked to protect even the modern artist. She is the original source of life whether mother or mother-earth, both stone goddess and contemporary icon. The woman has become the symbol of a primeval deity, invoked to protect the work and lending it a spiritual (pre-Christian) intensity. She can be an angel, lover, mother-earth or goddess but always a woman.

 Characteristically, Odessa art is non-literary and rejects narrative implication. These artists strive for the purity of the image, with an emphasis on decorativeness and on a specifically painterly professionalism. Formal experiment often leads to metaphysical flight and aesthetic rebellion is confined within the frame of the painting without reference to any social theories. There is an implicitly optimistic psyche motivating the creative energy of the artists. It is a psyche in which there is no room for fatalistic notions.

 * At the reception, the bride dances with each of the unmarried women present, and places a special veil on each of them. This veil symbolises that they are still pure, but that the bride hopes they will get married soon. She also throws her veil and the girl who catches it first will likely be the next to marry.

 [[Image:Virsky Vstup.JPG|thumb|The Ukrainian Welcome Dance, known as ''[[Pryvit]]''.|300px|right]]
 
 Traditional dances are popular within Ukraine, many of which derive from rural [[Cossack]] villages.<ref name=""ukraine1""/> One Ukrainian style of dancing is called the ''[[kalyna]]''. Both men and women participate in this type of dancing.
-
 * The women wear colourful costumes, sometimes featuring a solid-coloured (usually blue, green, red, or black) tunic and matching apron, and under that an open skirt, and below that a white skirt with an embroidered hem that should reach an inch or so below the knee. If they wear a tunic, then under that they wear a long-sleeved richly [[Ukrainian embroidery|embroidered]] white shirt. Traditionally, women wear a type of red leather boots to dance in. They also wear a flower head piece ([[vinok]]), that is a headband covered with [[flowers]] and has long flowing ribbons down the back that flow when they dance, and plain red coral [[necklaces]].
 * The men wear baggy [[trousers]] (usually blue, white, black or red) and a shirt (usually white, but sometimes black) embroidered at the neck and down the stomach. Over the shirt they sometimes will wear a richly embroidered [[vest]]. Around their waist they wear a thick sash with fringed ends. Like the women, they wear [[boots]], but these can be black or white in addition to red.
 * Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the ''[[pryvitannia]]'', is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with [[salt]] on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].

Like the women, they wear [[boots]], but these can be black or white in addition to red.
 * Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the ''[[pryvitannia]]'', is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with [[salt]] on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].

 ''""Art has never been unchangeable. It is evident that Ukrainian art could not grow stiff. As far back as the revolution, we had Futurists and Constructivists and Cubists. All that was choked from above.""''
 M. Butovych. New York. 1956
 
-In 1963, the destroyer of Ukrainian Avant-garde, art critic Kuriltseva, complacently summed up the results of her activities: ""Where have the once notorious Bohomazov and the Pastukhov brothers vanished? They disappeared from art without trace, as if they had never existed.""*
+In 1963, the art critic Kuriltseva, destroyer of the Ukrainian Avant-garde,  complacently summed up the results of her activities: ""Where have the once notorious Bohomazov and the Pastukhov brothers vanished? They disappeared from art without trace, as if they had never existed.""*
 
 Her generation triumphed: Khrushchev himself headed the struggle against abstractionism and other 'isms/ They persecuted leftists for decades, killed the Boichukists, in 1937, in the People's Commissariat for Public Education, burnt down portraits of 'the enemies of the people' painted by Petrytsky, cut paintings by Sedlyar, Shekhtman and Hvozdyk in the Kyiv Museum of Russian Art, in 1952, passed death sentences to canvases by Palmov, Bohomazov and others in the Museum of Ukrainian Fine Arts, and, in the same year, destroyed works by Arkhypenko, Kovzhun and Narbut in Lviv, and fired Yermylov and Synyakova from the Artists Union for their pro-Western moods.
 
-Meanwhile, the youth of the 1960s tried to find information on Ukrainian Avant-garde art and discovered a hot mainland of Ukrainian art history. They sought out the survived Boichukists and Constructivists Pavlenko, Yermylov, Bizyukov, Vrona, Pecharkovska, Kolos, and the widows and relatives of the deceased Bohomazova, Petrytska, Redko, Zhdanko, Khvostenko, and Manevych. They searched in the funds, archives and libraries. They also informed collectors Sigalov, Ivakin, Sveshnikov and Lobanov-Rostovsky, as well as consulted with researchers from Moscow, Leningrad, Warsaw, Paris, and the USA. They risked their careers and freedom to penetrate Ukrainian diaspora 'In search of the time past.""

-A counter current of interest was from Western art historians, specializing in Russian art, who told each other ""Go to Kyiv, there is Bohomazov."" As it turned out, the roots of Russian Avant-garde could be found in Ukraine. For example, what was Goncharova's paintings inspired with? — the Polovtsian stone images on the steppes of Ukraine. Which cities were associated with the life and work of the Futurist and trans-rationalist Terentyev? — Kherson, Kharkiv, Odessa and Dnipropetrovsk. Why did Malevych make such frequent mentions of Pymonenko and ""the famous master from Chernihiv, Murashko"" in the last years of his life? What does the title of Exter's painting, Fundukleyivska at Night, mean? How can you explain why Davyd Burlyuk called himself a 'Tartar-Za-porozhian Futurist'? How did it happen that Matyushin, prohibited in Leningrad, was readily published in Kharkiv?

How did it happen that Matyushin, prohibited in Leningrad, was readily published in Kharkiv?
 
 Deciding these questions, some Western historians of Russian art became historians of Ukrainian Avant-garde as well (the Marcades — France, Boiko — Poland, Bowlt — the USA, Nakov — France, Mudrak — the USA).
 
-Furthermore, well-known London art collector, Mr. Lobanov-Rostovsky, collects sketches by stage designers of the Kyiv school, Exter, Meller, Petrytsky, Khvostov, Rabynovych, Tyshler and Chelishchev. At the 1988 exhibition of his collection of paintings in Moscow, he told me with conviction: 'You must write a book on five uniquely gifted Ukrainian artists: Arkhypenko, Bohomazov, Exter, Yermylov and Petrytsky."" I gladly consented to this proposition adding to the list some more names — Malevych, Palmov, Tatlin, Burlyuk and Boichuk. These are the great names around which dozens of students and adherents grouped establishing various art trends, schools and currents. Through them, Ukrainian culture was rapidly Europeanized, while in Europe and America it began to breathe with Rus-Ukraine. Unfortunately, Stalin's terror cut off informatbn of Ukrainian art to the world.

-...The notion 'Ukrainian Avant-garde' was introduced by Paris art critic, Nakov, in reference to the exhibition, Tatlin's Dream, held in London in 1973. For the first time ever, the West saw world-class works by Yermylov and Bohomazov, two obscure Avant-gardists from Ukraine. Their works brought to mind the names of world-famous masters whose origin, education, self-perception and national traditions were linked with Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, Odessa and with the Ukrainian cultural tradition in general. Among them were Burlyuk, ""the most faithful son of Ukraine,"" the Pole, Malevych, who considered himself to be a Ukrainian; Tatlin, professor of the Kyiv Art Institute and bandura-player; Exter, the founder of the Ukrainian school of constructivist stage design. And lastly, Arkhypenko, who was inspired by his indelible impressions of his homeland, the magic of the Tripillya civilizatbn. the archaic Polovtsian stone images, the resonant contours of mosaics in the St. Sophia of Kyiv and reliefs of St. Michael's Cathedral of the Golden Domes, and the colours of folk ceramics.

-[[Food]] is an important part to the Ukrainian culture. Special foods are used at [[Easter]], as well as [[Christmas]], that are not made at any other time of the year. At Christmas time, for example, ''[[kutia]]'', a mixture of cooked wheat [[groats]], [[poppy seeds]], and [[honey]], and special sweet breads are prepared.
-
-An average Ukrainian diet consists of [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[cheese]], and a variety of [[sausages]]. [[Head cheese]] is also quite popular in Ukraine, as well as ''Kolbasa'' ({{lang-ua|Ковбаса́, ''Kovbasa''}}), a type of sausage. Typically [[bread]] is a core part of every meal, and must be included for the meal to be ""complete."" At Christmas time, for example, it is the tradition to have a [[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|twelve-course meal]]. Included at Easter are the famous [[pysanky]] (colored and patterned eggs). Making these eggs is a long process, and they are not actually eaten, but displayed in the center of the table (usually around the bread).

-In 1963, the art critic Kuriltseva, destroyer of the Ukrainian Avant-garde,  complacently summed up the results of her activities: ""Where have the once notorious Bohomazov and the Pastukhov brothers vanished? They disappeared from art without trace, as if they had never existed.""*

 Her generation triumphed: Khrushchev himself headed the struggle against abstractionism and other 'isms/ They persecuted leftists for decades, killed the Boichukists, in 1937, in the People's Commissariat for Public Education, burnt down portraits of 'the enemies of the people' painted by Petrytsky, cut paintings by Sedlyar, Shekhtman and Hvozdyk in the Kyiv Museum of Russian Art, in 1952, passed death sentences to canvases by Palmov, Bohomazov and others in the Museum of Ukrainian Fine Arts, and, in the same year, destroyed works by Arkhypenko, Kovzhun and Narbut in Lviv, and fired Yermylov and Synyakova from the Artists Union for their pro-Western moods.

-Additional interest came from Western art historians, specializing in Russian art, who told each other ""Go to Kyiv, there is Bohomazov."" As it turned out, the roots of Russian Avant-garde could be found in Ukraine. For example, [[Natalie Goncharova]] had been inspired by  Polovtsian stone images from the steppes of Ukraine. Which cities were associated with the life and work of the Futurist and trans-rationalist Terentyev? — Kherson, Kharkiv, Odessa and Dnipropetrovsk. [[Kazimir Malevich]] mades frequent mentions of Pymonenko and ""the famous master from Chernihiv, Murashko"" in the last years of his life.  What does the title of Exter's painting, Fundukleyivska at Night, mean? How can you explain why Davyd Burlyuk called himself a 'Tartar-Za-porozhian Futurist'? How did it happen that Matyushin, prohibited in Leningrad, was readily published in Kharkiv?

 Deciding these questions, some Western historians of Russian art became historians of Ukrainian Avant-garde as well (the Marcades — France, Boiko — Poland, Bowlt — the USA, Nakov — France, Mudrak — the USA).
 
 Furthermore, well-known London art collector, Mr. Lobanov-Rostovsky, collected sketches by stage designers of the Kyiv school, Exter, Meller, Petrytsky, Khvostov, Rabynovych, Tyshler and Chelishchev. At the 1988 exhibition of his collection of paintings in Moscow, he told me with conviction: 'You must write a book on five uniquely gifted Ukrainian artists: Arkhypenko, Bohomazov, Exter, Yermylov and Petrytsky."" I gladly consented to this proposition adding to the list some more names — Malevych, Palmov, Tatlin, Burlyuk and Boichuk. These are the great names around which dozens of students and adherents grouped establishing various art trends, schools and currents. Through them, Ukrainian culture was rapidly Europeanized, while in Europe and America it began to breathe with Rus-Ukraine. Unfortunately, Stalin's terror cut off information of Ukrainian art to the world.
 
-The term 'Ukrainian Avant-garde' was introduced by Paris art critic, Nakov, in reference to the exhibition, Tatlin's Dream, held in London in 1973. For the first time ever, the West saw world-class works by Yermylov and Bohomazov, two obscure Avant-gardists from Ukraine.

-''LIGHT, LUCIDITY AND FREEDOM''
-
-The city of [[Odessa]] is arguably the most important artistic centre in Ukraine. Its landscape stands firmly within the artist's field of vision, transformed into a creative image by figurative experiment. Indeed, with its spectacular topography and pan-mediterranean, Odessa has long been an inspiration to the great painters, who exploit the bright sun filled colours of the Odessa landscape. Odessa painters are able to capture the purest elements of art, exploiting not just the airy brightness typical of the city but also the rectilinear and cursive shapes of rock formations along the shores of the [[Black Sea]] and even the expanse of the shoreline repeated in horizontal stripes on their canvasses.
-
-The importance of light in their work can not be overstressed. The unique qualities of light on the Black Sea shore have caused artists working their to deploy a diversity of spacial solutions and to develop special notions of plasticity to convey volumes and outlines. Formal experiment with light developed during the 1970s in contrast to the deepening gloom of social reality and the slow decline of national consciousnes; the works of Odessa artists more and more are imbued with the strongest sensations of purifying, cleansing sunlight in all its depth. One Ukrainian painter in the 1970s defined her aesthetic credo as: 'light, lucidity and freedom'
-
-'''""The Specific Characteristics of The Odessa Group""'''
-
-There is a strong folkloric tendency in Odessa art and an awareness of the Black Sea's ancient cultures. One ritual characteristic is the ubiquitous female form. Totemistic 'stone women' are plentiful on the steppes of Ukraine and in the museums of Odessa and contemporary Ukrainian art reflects this. The woman is invoked to protect even the modern artist. She is the original source of life whether mother or mother-earth, both stone goddess and contemporary icon. The woman has become the symbol of a primeval deity, invoked to protect the work and lending it a spiritual (pre-Christian) intensity. She can be an angel, lover, mother-earth or goddess but always a woman.
-
-Characteristically, Odessa art is non-literary and rejects narrative implication. These artists strive for the purity of the image, with an emphasis on decorativeness and on a specifically painterly professionalism. Formal experiment often leads to metaphysical flight and aesthetic rebellion is confined within the frame of the painting without reference to any social theories. There is an implicitly optimistic psyche motivating the creative energy of the artists. It is a psyche in which there is no room for fatalistic notions.
-
-Whether in exile in Munich, New York or Washington, in internal exile in Moscow, or living in Odessa, these artists have remained true to their century-long traditions of formal pictorial experiment.

 * The women wear colourful costumes, sometimes featuring a solid-coloured (usually blue, green, red, or black) tunic and matching apron, and under that an open skirt, and below that a white skirt with an embroidered hem that should reach an inch or so below the knee. If they wear a tunic, then under that they wear a long-sleeved richly [[Ukrainian embroidery|embroidered]] white shirt. Traditionally, women wear a type of red leather boots to dance in.

Over the shirt they sometimes will wear a richly embroidered [[vest]]. Around their waist they wear a thick sash with fringed ends. Like the women, they wear [[boots]], but these can be black or white in addition to red.
 * Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the ''[[pryvitannia]]'', is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with [[salt]] on a cloth and flowers.

-Weddings traditionally take place in [[Church (building)|churches]], the bride in white and the groom in black. Wedding celebrations are known to continue for days and even weeks. They are accompanied by lively music and dancing, drinking and eating, and fellowship.
-
-Some particular wedding customs include:
-* Before the wedding, the groom goes with his friends to the bride's house and bargains with ""money' to get a bride from her family.
-* When leaving the church, the bride carries a basket of candies or sweets to throw to children and the crowd.
-* The groom carries her down the stairs.
-* At the reception, the bride dances with each of the unmarried women present, and places a special veil on each of them. This veil symbolises that they are still pure, but that the bride hopes they will get married soon. She also throws her veil and the girl who catches it first will likely be the next to marry.
+Traditional Ukrainian wedding celebrations have many rituals that involve music and dancing, drinking and eating, and crowds of people. The wedding consists of three separate parts that can last for days or even weeks. First there's a [[Engagement|betrothal]], then a ceremony, followed by a celebration (vesillia). The betrothal involves the groom going to the bride's parents to bargain for a [[ransom]] price for the bride. There are many stories in Ukrainian folklore of a bride being stolen without the groom paying ransom. If the bride refuses the offer of marriage, it is customary for the parents to meet the groom at the door with a [[pumpkin]] to convey the message. The official ceremony takes place in a church, often in a group with other couples. A celebration follows at home with the entire community participating.

 ===Ornamental and visual art===
 On special occasions, every aspect of ordinary life is transformed into ornamental art form of artistic expression. Ornamentation and design motifs are steeped in symbolism, religious [[ritual]] and meaning. From the [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the [[Peresopnytsia Gospel]] to the famous [[Pysanka|pysanky]] and [[Vytynanky (Wycinanki)|vytynanky]], intricate details have ancient meaning. Much of the oral history was lost during the past 300 years of [[Russification of Ukraine]] when Ukrainian culture and language were forbidden. Organizations like the [[Ivan Honchar Museum]], [[Pysanka Museum]] and the [[Ukrainian Museum]] are dedicated to historic preservation. Different regions of Ukraine have their own traditional ornamentation with their own variation of style and meaning. Examples can be seen in [[Petrykivsky Painting]], ornamental architecture, [[Ukrainian embroidery]], and textile motifs from various [[Ukrainian historical regions]].

 ====Weddings====
 {{Main|Ukrainian wedding traditions}}
 Traditional Ukrainian wedding celebrations have many rituals that involve music and dancing, drinking and eating, and crowds of people. The wedding consists of three separate parts that can last for days or even weeks. First there's a [[Engagement|betrothal]], then a ceremony, followed by a big celebration. The betrothal involves the groom going to the bride's parents to bargain for a [[ransom]] price for the bride and to seek the blessing of her parents. There are many stories in Ukrainian folklore of a bride being [[Bride kidnapping|stolen]] without the groom paying ransom. Often, the stolen bride is a wiling participant and the couple [[Elopement (marriage)|elopes]] without her parents permission.
-The bride can refuses the offer of marriage, in which case, it is customary for the parents to meet the groom at the door with a [[pumpkin]] to convey the message. The official ceremony takes place in a church, often in a group with other couples. A celebration follows at home with the entire community participating.

 An average Ukrainian diet consists of [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[cheese]], and a variety of [[sausages]]. [[Head cheese]] is also quite popular in Ukraine, as well as ''Kolbasa'' ({{lang-ua|Ковбаса́, ''Kovbasa''}}), a type of sausage.

The wedding consists of three separate parts that can last for days or even weeks. First there's a [[Engagement|betrothal]], then a ceremony, followed by a big celebration. The betrothal involves the groom going to the bride's parents to bargain for [[Bride price|ransom]] he will pay for the bride and to seek the blessing of her parents. There are many stories in Ukrainian folklore of a bride being [[Bride kidnapping|stolen]] without the groom paying ransom. Often, the stolen bride is a willing participant and the couple [[Elopement (marriage)|elopes]] without her parents permission. Alternatively, the bride can refuse an offer of marriage, in which case, it is customary for the parents to meet the groom at the door with a [[pumpkin]] to convey the message. After they reach an agreement, the official [[wedding]] takes place in a church, often in a group ceremony with other couples. A celebration follows at home with the entire community participating.

 On special occasions, every aspect of ordinary life is transformed into ornamental art form of artistic expression. Ornamentation and design motifs are steeped in symbolism, religious [[ritual]] and meaning. From the [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the [[Peresopnytsia Gospel]] to the famous [[Pysanka|pysanky]] and [[Vytynanky (Wycinanki)|vytynanky]], intricate details have ancient meaning. Much of the oral history was lost during the past 300 years of [[Russification of Ukraine]] when Ukrainian culture and language were forbidden. Organizations like the [[Ivan Honchar Museum]], [[Pysanka Museum]] and the [[Ukrainian Museum]] are dedicated to historic preservation. Different regions of Ukraine have their own traditional ornamentation with their own variation of style and meaning. Examples can be seen in [[Petrykivsky Painting]], ornamental architecture, [[Ukrainian embroidery]], and textile motifs from various [[Ukrainian historical regions]].

Both men and women participate in this type of dancing.
 * The women wear colourful costumes, sometimes featuring a solid-coloured (usually blue, green, red, or black) tunic and matching apron, and under that an open skirt, and below that a white skirt with an embroidered hem that should reach an inch or so below the knee. If they wear a tunic, then under that they wear a long-sleeved richly [[Ukrainian embroidery|embroidered]] white shirt. Traditionally, women wear a type of red leather boots to dance in. They also wear a flower head piece ([[vinok]]), that is a headband covered with [[flowers]] and has long flowing ribbons down the back that flow when they dance, and plain red coral [[necklaces]].
 * The men wear baggy [[trousers]] (usually blue, white, black or red) and a shirt (usually white, but sometimes black) embroidered at the neck and down the stomach. Over the shirt they sometimes will wear a richly embroidered [[vest]]. Around their waist they wear a thick sash with fringed ends. Like the women, they wear [[boots]], but these can be black or white in addition to red.
 * Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the ''[[pryvitannia]]'', is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with [[salt]] on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].",Link to DAB page -> redlink,Narky Blert,2017-11-16T19:36:20Z,"Changed the link for ""kalyna"" from a redlink to a proper link to the ""Kalyna (dance)"" page.

+===Respect for authority===
+Ukrainians have almost zero respect for authority. It can be seen in the they treat their government, for instance how they throw rotten eggs at them when people are dissatisfied with something or how they make up memes and jokes when politicians make some mistakes in any activity. Ukrainians also tend to ignore a lot of rules because of the absence of fear of being punished by authority. There is also a popular saying amongst population “The severity of traffic rules in our country is compensated by the unnecessity of following them”. This massive lack of respect is mainly caused by huge distrust for any kind of state governance and its related departments. The latest social research <ref>https://strana.ua/articles/121996-pochemu-rejtinh-vlasti-upal-do-istoricheskoho-minimuma.html</ref> shows that only 12% of the population believes that their leaders and public servants make a good job of managing the county’s internal and external policies. Moreover, corruption in Ukraine thrives extremely, especially in the sphere of governance of any kind, so it also facilitates deeper disrespect for authority.

 Ukrainians have almost zero respect for authority.

Ukrainians also tend to ignore a lot of rules because of the absence of fear of being punished by authority. There is also a popular saying amongst population “The severity of traffic rules in our country is compensated by the unnecessity of following them”.

-=== '''Ukrainian market - Bazaar''' ===
-Bazaar is well-known mostly for marketplaces of Middle Eastern countries. But Ukrainians usually call an open market with the same word, less often - 'rynok'. Many Ukrainians who has been living during the Soviet Era, remember that Rynok or Bazaar was only one place where people could find all necessary things. Probably, that's why this type of shopping places is still popular in Ukraine. You can find such markets in every Ukrainian city or town.  For example, [[Kiev|Kyiv]], the Ukrainian capital, is full of them and one of the most popular is the [[Besarabsky Market]]. In such markets people sell fresh seasonal vegetables, meat, fish, homemade cottage cheese, second-hand and new clothes, household things, books etc<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aimrealtykiev.com/guide-to-kievs-farmers-markets-and-bazaars/|title=Guide to Kiev's Farmer's Markets and Bazaars|date=2015-03-24|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>. In case you need something you don't even know where you can find it - just go to the Rynok, or how Ukrainians call it 'Na Bazaar', and ask. People there know everything.
-
-Bazaar or Rynok in Ukraine - it's not only about selling grocery - it is a whole social and even cultural phenomenon. People meet there, talk with each other, share the latest news and gossips. It is a different story how Ukrainian sellers praise and call to buy their goods. Big Ukrainian cities, for example, Kyiv, [[Lviv]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Dnipro]] is also known for the 'spontaneous markets'. It happens when people from countryside around the big city bring their homemade products and sell them in crowded places in the city: near the metro, in the central parts of the city, at the railway stations etc. Walking through the streets of the Ukrainian city you can stumble upon a cute (or not) 'babusya' (grandmother) asking you to buy one or two fresh apples/flowers/pears etc.

-Compared to modern shiny shopping malls, the city’s markets might seem a little bit shabby, but in case you want to feel everyday Ukrainian soul you have definitely visit any Rynok you'll find<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/lifestyle/kyivs-markets-offer-homegrown-food-secondhand-treasures-books-much.html|title=Kyiv’s markets offer homegrown food, secondhand treasures, books and much more|date=2017-10-13|website=KyivPost|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>.{{clear}}

 ===Respect for authority===
-Ukrainians have almost zero respect for authority. It can be seen in the way treat their government, for instance how they throw rotten eggs at them when people are dissatisfied with something or how they make up memes and jokes when politicians make some mistakes in any activity. Ukrainians also tend to ignore a lot of rules because of the absence of fear of being punished by authority. There is also a popular saying amongst population “The severity of traffic rules in our country is compensated by the unnecessity of following them”. This massive lack of respect is mainly caused by huge distrust for any kind of state governance and its related departments. The latest social research <ref>https://strana.ua/articles/121996-pochemu-rejtinh-vlasti-upal-do-istoricheskoho-minimuma.html</ref> shows that only 12% of the population believes that their leaders and public servants make a good job of managing the county’s internal and external policies. Moreover, corruption in Ukraine thrives extremely, especially in the sphere of governance of any kind, so it also facilitates deeper disrespect for authority.

-The modern Ukrainian culture is believed to be formed as a descendent of the Old Russian (Ruthenian) state centered in [[Kiev]] and known as [[Kievan Rus']].

-The idea of Ukrainian culture and ethnic studies has its controversies. According to modern Russian ethnic studies and historiography Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian nation is part of bigger [[triune Russian nation]], where Russians are dominant ethnic group and Ukrainians are simply its regional branch. At the same time Ukrainian culture has a lot of commonalities with [[Polish culture]] and [[Belarusian culture]], lesser extent [[Yiddish culture]], due to being related for many centuries to the former [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. In addition Ukrainian culture has special relations with Moldavian culture which is part of bigger [[Vlach nation]] today politically realized as country of [[Romania]].

+Ukrainian customs are heavily influenced by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and traditions from [[Slavic mythology]].

Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].

 '''Ukrainian culture''' is a composition of material and spiritual values of [[Ukrainian people]] that has formed throughout its history ([[Ukrainian history]]). It is closely intertwined with [[ethnic studies]] about ethnic Ukrainians and Ukrainian [[historiography]] which is focused on [[history of Kyiv]] and region around it.
 
-Although the country has often struggled to preserve its independence its people have managed to retain their cultural possessions and are proud of the considerable cultural legacy they have created. Numerous writers have contributed to the country's rich literary history such as [[Taras Shevchenko]] and [[Ivan Franko]]. The Ukrainian culture has experienced a significant resurgence since the establishment of independence in 1991.

 The modern Ukrainian culture is believed to be formed as a descendant of the ancient state of [[Kyivan Rus']] centered in [[Kyiv]] as well the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]], both of which Ukrainians claim as their historical ancestors. Therefore it has a shared culture and history with neighboring nations, such as [[Belarusians]] and [[Russians]]. Ukrainian historian, academic and politician of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] referred to Ukraine as ''Ukraine-Rus,'' emphasising Ukraines historical claim to the ancient state of Kyivan Rus.

 Ukrainian culture has had to overcome numerous obstacles in order to survive and retain its originality, since foreign powers and empires who dominated the country and its people in the past often implemented policies aimed at assimilating the Ukrainian population into their own population, as well as trying to eradicate and purge elements of the culture. For example, the policy of [[Russification of Ukraine|Russification]] posed significant obstacles to the development of the culture.

 Although the country has often struggled to preserve its independence its people have managed to retain their cultural possessions and are proud of the considerable cultural legacy they have created. Numerous writers have contributed to the country's literary history such as [[Taras Shevchenko]] and [[Ivan Franko]]. The Ukrainian culture has experienced a significant resurgence since the establishment of independence in 1991.
 
-The modern Ukrainian culture is believed to be formed as a descendant of the ancient state of [[Kyivan Rus']] centered in [[Kyiv]] as well the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]], both of which Ukrainians claim as their historical ancestors. Therefore it has a shared culture and history with neighboring nations, such as [[Belarusians]] and [[Russians]].

 Traditional peasant folk art, embroidery and vernacular architecture are critical to Ukrainian culture, and its elements have often been determined by the resources available at the time. The country's strong tradition of folk art and embroidery continues to this day, with [[Ukrainian embroidery]] often considered an art form in itself. 
 
 Ukrainian customs are heavily influenced by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and traditions from [[Slavic mythology]]. The [[Soviet era]] unified the cultures of many unrelated nations with a common language and led to the appropriation of many of the socialist republics culture and identity. Because of the country's location its culture has been influenced by both Europe and Asia.
 
-Ukrainian culture has had to overcome numerous obstacles in order to survive and retain its originality, since foreign powers and empires who dominated the country and its people in the past often implemented policies aimed at assimilating the Ukrainian population into their own population, as well as trying to eradicate and purge elements of the culture. For example, the policy of [[Russification of Ukraine|Russification]] posed significant obstacles to the development of the culture.

 Traditional dances are popular within Ukraine, many of which derive from rural [[Cossack]] villages.<ref name=""ukraine1"">[http://www.ukraine.com/culture/ Culture in Ukraine | By Ukraine Channel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> One Ukrainian style of dancing is called the ''[[Kalyna (dance)|kalyna]]''. Both men and women participate in this type of dancing.
 * The women wear colourful costumes, sometimes featuring a solid-coloured (usually blue, green, red, or black) tunic and matching apron, and under that an open skirt, and below that a white skirt with an embroidered hem that should reach an inch or so below the knee. If they wear a tunic, then under that they wear a long-sleeved richly [[Ukrainian embroidery|embroidered]] white shirt. Traditionally, women wear a type of red leather boots to dance in. They also wear a flower head piece ([[vinok]]), that is a headband covered with [[flowers]] and has long flowing ribbons down the back that flow when they dance, and plain red coral [[necklaces]].
 * The men wear baggy [[trousers]] (usually blue, white, black or red) and a shirt (usually white, but sometimes black) embroidered at the neck and down the stomach. Over the shirt they sometimes will wear a richly embroidered [[vest]]. Around their waist they wear a thick sash with fringed ends. Like the women, they wear [[Boot|boots]], but these can be black or white in addition to red.
-* Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the ''[[pryvitannia]]'', is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with [[salt]] on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].

If they wear a tunic, then under that they wear a long-sleeved richly [[Ukrainian embroidery|embroidered]] white shirt. Traditionally, women wear a type of red leather boots to dance in.

It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with [[salt]] on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements.

-Traditional Ukrainian wedding celebrations have many rituals that involve music and dancing, drinking and eating, and crowds of people. The wedding consists of three separate parts that can last for days or even weeks. First there's a [[Engagement|betrothal]], then a ceremony, followed by a big celebration. The betrothal involves the groom going to the bride's parents to bargain for [[Bride price|ransom]] he will pay for the bride and to seek the blessing of her parents. There are many stories in Ukrainian folklore of a bride being [[Bride kidnapping|stolen]] without the groom paying ransom. Often, the stolen bride is a willing participant and the couple [[Elopement (marriage)|elopes]] without her parents permission. Alternatively, the bride can refuse an offer of marriage, in which case, it is customary for the parents to meet the groom at the door with a [[pumpkin]] to convey the message. After they reach an agreement, the official [[wedding]] takes place in a church, often in a group ceremony with other couples. A celebration follows at home with the entire community participating.

 ====Dance====
 {{Main|Ukrainian dance}}
 [[File:Rapid Trident 2014 06.jpg|thumb|The [[Hopak]] is often popularly referred to as the ""National Dance of Ukraine"". |right]]
 
-Traditional dances are popular within Ukraine, many of which derive from rural [[Cossack]] villages.<ref name=""ukraine1"">[http://www.ukraine.com/culture/ Culture in Ukraine | By Ukraine Channel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> One Ukrainian style of dancing is called the ''[[Kalyna (dance)|kalyna]]''. Both men and women participate in this type of dancing.
-* The women wear colourful costumes, sometimes featuring a solid-coloured (usually blue, green, red, or black) tunic and matching apron, and under that an open skirt, and below that a white skirt with an embroidered hem that should reach an inch or so below the knee. If they wear a tunic, then under that they wear a long-sleeved richly [[Ukrainian embroidery|embroidered]] white shirt. Traditionally, women wear a type of red leather boots to dance in. They also wear a flower head piece ([[vinok]]), that is a headband covered with [[flowers]] and has long flowing ribbons down the back that flow when they dance, and plain red coral [[necklaces]].
-* The men wear baggy [[trousers]] (usually blue, white, black or red) and a shirt (usually white, but sometimes black) embroidered at the neck and down the stomach. Over the shirt they sometimes will wear a richly embroidered [[vest]]. Around their waist they wear a thick sash with fringed ends. Like the women, they wear [[Boot|boots]], but these can be black or white in addition to red.
-* Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the ''[[pryvitannia|pryvitannya]]'', is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with [[salt]] on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].

 The modern Ukrainian culture is believed to be formed as a descendant of the ancient state of [[Kyivan Rus']] centered in [[Kyiv]] as well the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]], both of which Ukrainians claim as their historical ancestors.<ref name=""Brit_Galicia"">{{cite web |title=Galicia |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Galicia-historical-region-Eastern-Europe |website=Britannica |access-date=7 March 2022}}</ref><ref name=""Brit_Volhynia"">{{cite web |title=Volhynia |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Volhynia |website=Britannica |access-date=7 March 2022}}</ref> Therefore it has a shared culture and history with neighboring nations, such as [[Belarusians]] and [[Russians]]. Ukrainian historian, academic and politician of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] referred to Ukraine as ''Ukraine-Rus,'' emphasising Ukraines historical claim to the ancient state of Kievan Rus. 
 
 Traditional peasant folk art, embroidery and vernacular architecture are critical to Ukrainian culture, and its elements have often been determined by the resources available at the time. The country's strong tradition of folk art and embroidery continues to this day, with [[Ukrainian embroidery]] often considered an art form in itself.

 Traditional Ukrainian wedding celebrations have many rituals that involve music and dancing, drinking and eating, and crowds of people. The wedding consists of three separate parts that can last for days or even weeks. First there's a [[Engagement|betrothal]], then a ceremony, followed by a big celebration. The betrothal involves the groom going to the bride's parents to bargain for [[Bride price|ransom]] he will pay for the bride and to seek the blessing of her parents. There are many stories in Ukrainian folklore of a bride being [[Bride kidnapping|stolen]] without the groom paying ransom. Often, the stolen bride is a willing participant and the couple [[Elopement (marriage)|elopes]] without her parents permission. Alternatively, the bride can refuse an offer of marriage, in which case, it is customary for the parents to meet the groom at the door with a [[pumpkin]] to convey the message, if a pumpkin is given then the bridegroom can find one of the friends of the bride to see who is interested and begin the courtship process again if he finds one of the friends of the girlfriend is interested if the parents of the girlfriend gave a pumpkin, (this is specifically a Ukrainian traditional custom), the parents they usually ask for a moment before giving a final reply to see if the daughter is interested in private without the boyfriend being present while he is waiting in the guestroom. living room for the reply, if the girlfriend is not interested or if the parents find the man unsuitable for their daughter, then the father comes forward and gives a pumpkin, but even though a pumpkin is not the end of the world, for the boyfriend means the end of a relationship and that means that one of the friends of the bride he can show his interest, in that case and see if one of them is interested in him then they begin the relationship, still nowadays the tradition is the relationship ideally between the courtship process all the way to marriage should no longer than 2 years.

Alternatively, the bride can refuse an offer of marriage, in which case, it is customary for the parents to meet the groom at the door with a [[pumpkin]] to convey the message, if a pumpkin is given then the bridegroom can find one of the friends of the bride to see who is interested and begin the courtship process again if he finds one of the friends of the girlfriend is interested if the parents of the girlfriend gave a pumpkin, (this is specifically a Ukrainian traditional custom), the parents they usually ask for a moment before giving a final reply to see if the daughter is interested in private without the boyfriend being present while he is waiting in the guestroom. living room for the reply, if the girlfriend is not interested or if the parents find the man unsuitable for their daughter, then the father comes forward and gives a pumpkin, but even though a pumpkin is not the end of the world, for the boyfriend means the end of a relationship and that means that one of the friends of the bride he can show his interest, in that case and see if one of them is interested in him then they begin the relationship, still nowadays the tradition is the relationship ideally between the courtship process all the way to marriage should no longer than 2 years.

+
+unlike the west where in the west people question the parents, in Ukranian culture if the boyfriend is given a pumpkin the boyfriend cannot ask why he was declined. some parents might give the answer some might not. however that means that the groom he has to respect it and move on.
+
+in Ukranian culture nowadays as well as most Slavic and eastern cultures it is considered very rude for someone younger, even if they are not part of the same family, to question parents.
+
+once the young man and young woman reach an agreement , as long as the pumpkin is not given and the parents fully consent and give the blessing, the official [[wedding]] takes place in a church, often in a group ceremony with other couples each one carries an wedding icon the lady carries the Virgin Mary and the man carries the icon of Our Lord (both icons need to be previously blessed by a priest) once this happens the couple holds the icon as the parents give the blessing to them with another traditional custom.

-There is also a popular saying amongst population “The severity of traffic rules in our country is compensated by the unnecessity of following them”. This relative lack of respect is mainly caused by huge distrust for any kind of state governance and its related departments. The latest social research<ref>{{cite web |url=https://strana.today/articles/121996-pochemu-rejtinh-vlasti-upal-do-istoricheskoho-minimuma.html |title = Почему рейтинг власти упал до исторического минимума}}</ref> shows that only 12% of the population believes that their leaders and public servants make a good job of managing the county's internal and external policies. Moreover, [[corruption in Ukraine]] thrives, especially in the sphere of governance of any kind, so it also facilitates deeper disrespect for authority.<ref name=""PU_Trust"">{{cite web |title=Ukrainian Trust in Authorities Decreases |url=https://www.promoteukraine.org/ukrainian-trust-in-authorities-decreases/ |website=Promote Ukraine |access-date=7 March 2022}}</ref>

**Analysis:** The addition of the image of Mariinskyi Palace emphasizes a significant cultural site in Ukraine, which could be interpreted as an effort to highlight Ukrainian heritage. The rephrasing of the Architecture section to include a more detailed context about Ukrainian architecture may also serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural identity. 

**Conclusion:** Not Weaponised. The changes appear to enhance cultural representation without overtly politicizing the content.",Not Weaponised

 {{Main|Ukrainian wedding traditions}}
 Traditional Ukrainian wedding celebrations have many rituals that involve music and dancing, drinking and eating, and crowds of people. The wedding consists of three separate parts that can last for days or even weeks. First there is a [[Engagement|betrothal]], then a ceremony, followed by a big celebration. The betrothal involves the groom going to the bride's parents to bargain for the [[Bride price|dowry]] he will pay for the bride and to seek the blessing of her parents. There are many stories in Ukrainian folklore of a bride being [[Bride kidnapping|stolen]] without the groom paying ransom. Often, the stolen bride is a willing participant and the couple [[Elopement (marriage)|elopes]] without her parents' permission. Alternatively, the bride can refuse an offer of marriage, in which case, it is customary for the parents to meet the groom at the door with a [[pumpkin]] to convey the message, if a pumpkin is given then the bridegroom can find one of the friends of the bride to see who is interested and begin the courtship process again if he finds one of the friends of the girlfriend is interested if the parents of the girlfriend gave a pumpkin, (this is specifically a Ukrainian traditional custom), the parents they usually ask for a moment before giving a final reply to see if the daughter is interested in private without the boyfriend being present while he is waiting in the guestroom. living room for the reply, if the girlfriend is not interested or if the parents find the man unsuitable for their daughter, then the father comes forward and gives a pumpkin, but even though a pumpkin is not the end of the world, for the boyfriend means the end of a relationship and that means that one of the friends of the bride he can show his interest, in that case and see if one of them is interested in him then they begin the relationship, still nowadays the tradition is the relationship ideally between the courtship process all the way to marriage should no longer than two years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}

 {{Main|Ukrainian wedding traditions}}
 Traditional Ukrainian wedding celebrations have many rituals that involve music and dancing, drinking and eating, and crowds of people. The wedding consists of three separate parts that can last for days or even weeks. First there is a [[Engagement|betrothal]], then a ceremony, followed by a big celebration. The betrothal involves the groom going to the bride's parents to bargain for the [[Bride price|dowry]] he will pay for the bride and to seek the blessing of her parents. There are many stories in Ukrainian folklore of a bride being [[Bride kidnapping|stolen]] without the groom paying ransom. Often, the stolen bride is a willing participant and the couple [[Elopement (marriage)|elopes]] without her parents' permission. Alternatively, the bride can refuse an offer of marriage, in which case, it is customary for the parents to meet the groom at the door with a [[pumpkin]] to convey the message, if a pumpkin is given then the bridegroom can find one of the friends of the bride to see who is interested and begin the courtship process again if he finds one of the friends of the girlfriend is interested if the parents of the girlfriend gave a pumpkin, (this is specifically a Ukrainian traditional custom), the parents they usually ask for a moment before giving a final reply to see if the daughter is interested in private without the boyfriend being present while he is waiting in the guestroom. living room for the reply, if the girlfriend is not interested or if the parents find the man unsuitable for their daughter, then the father comes forward and gives a pumpkin, but even though a pumpkin is not the end of the world, for the boyfriend means the end of a relationship and that means that one of the friends of the bride he can show his interest, in that case and see if one of them is interested in him then they begin the relationship, still nowadays the tradition is the relationship ideally between the courtship process all the way to marriage should no longer than two years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}

 Once the young man and young woman reach an agreement and the parents fully consent and give the blessing, the official [[wedding]] takes place in a church, often in a group ceremony with other couples each one carries a wedding icon the lady carries the Theotokos and the man carries the icon of Our Lord (both icons need to be previously blessed by a priest) once this happens the couple holds the icon as the parents give the blessing to them with another traditional custom. A celebration follows at home with the entire community participating.<ref>{{cite web |title=Weddings at Soyuzivka |url=http://www.weddingsatsoyuzivka.com/traditions.html |website=Ukrainian Wedding Traditions |access-date=7 March 2022}}</ref>

 == Impact on culture due to Russian aggression ==
-During the Russian aggression against Ukraine, not only Ukrainian citizens and infrastructure, but also cultural [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] were targeted by the enemy. Destruction of monuments, attacks on educational and cultural institutions, robbery of museums - this is far from a complete list of crimes. Their number and the testimony of the employees of the affected institutions prove that it is not about individual excesses, but about a systematic and purposeful policy. Cultural heritage was targeted by the occupiers not by chance, but through purposeful [[Culture|cultural]] [[racism]].
-During the year of the full-scale war, 1,332 objects of cultural infrastructure were destroyed: [[Theatre|theaters]], [[philharmonic]] halls, [[Museum|museums]], [[Art gallery|galleries]], [[Library|libraries]], [[Club (organization)|clubs]]. More than a third of them are destroyed. As of mid-May 2023, the list of destroyed cultural monuments and objects of cultural heritage included more than 620 items.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Russians damage 1,946 cultural landmarks in two years of full-scale war against Ukraine |url=https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/03/7/7445420/ |access-date=2024-03-10 |website=Ukrainska Pravda |language=en}}</ref>

-{{Main|Ukrainian wedding traditions}}
-Traditional Ukrainian wedding celebrations have many rituals that involve music and dancing, drinking and eating, and crowds of people. The wedding consists of three separate parts that can last for days or even weeks. First there is a [[Engagement|betrothal]], then a ceremony, followed by a big celebration. The betrothal involves the groom going to the bride's parents to bargain for the [[Bride price|dowry]] he will pay for the bride and to seek the blessing of her parents. There are many stories in Ukrainian folklore of a bride being [[Bride kidnapping|stolen]] without the groom paying ransom. Often, the stolen bride is a willing participant and the couple [[Elopement (marriage)|elopes]] without her parents' permission. Alternatively, the bride can refuse an offer of marriage, in which case, it is customary for the parents to meet the groom at the door with a [[pumpkin]] to convey the message, if a pumpkin is given then the bridegroom can find one of the friends of the bride to see who is interested and begin the courtship process again if he finds one of the friends of the girlfriend is interested if the parents of the girlfriend gave a pumpkin, (this is specifically a Ukrainian traditional custom), the parents they usually ask for a moment before giving a final reply to see if the daughter is interested in private without the boyfriend being present while he is waiting in the guestroom. living room for the reply, if the girlfriend is not interested or if the parents find the man unsuitable for their daughter, then the father comes forward and gives a pumpkin, but even though a pumpkin is not the end of the world, for the boyfriend means the end of a relationship and that means that one of the friends of the bride he can show his interest, in that case and see if one of them is interested in him then they begin the relationship, still nowadays the tradition is the relationship ideally between the courtship process all the way to marriage should no longer than two years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}

-Unlike the West where people can question the parents, in Ukrainian culture if the boyfriend is given a pumpkin he cannot ask why he was declined.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-11-15 |title=Весілля |url=https://ridna-ukraina.com.ua/traditions/vesillia.html |website=Рідна Україна |language=uk}}</ref> However, that means that the groom has to respect it and move on.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}} In Ukrainian culture, as well as most Slavic and Eastern cultures, it is considered very rude for someone younger, even if they are not part of the same family, to question parents.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}

-Once the young man and young woman reach an agreement and the parents fully consent and give the blessing, the official [[wedding]] takes place in a church, often in a group ceremony with other couples each one carries a wedding icon the lady carries the Theotokos and the man carries the icon of Our Lord (both icons need to be previously blessed by a priest) once this happens the couple holds the icon as the parents give the blessing to them with another traditional custom.

-Traditional dances are popular within Ukraine, many of which derive from rural [[Cossack]] villages.<ref name=""ukraine1"">[http://www.ukraine.com/culture/ Culture in Ukraine | By Ukraine Channel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> One Ukrainian style of dancing is called the ''[[Kalyna (dance)|kalyna]]''. Both men and women participate in this type of dancing.<ref name=""Kalyna"">{{cite web |title=Chervona Kalyna |url=https://kalyna.org/ |website=Kalyna |access-date=7 March 2022}}</ref>
-* The women wear colourful costumes, sometimes featuring a solid-coloured (usually blue, green, red, or black) tunic and matching apron, and under that an open skirt, and below that a white skirt with an embroidered hem that should reach an inch or so below the knee. If they wear a tunic, then under that they wear a long-sleeved richly embroidered white shirt. Traditionally, women wear a type of red leather boots to dance in. They also wear a flower head piece ([[vinok]]), that is a headband covered with [[flowers]] and has long flowing ribbons down the back that flow when they dance, and plain red coral [[necklaces]].<ref name=""UNF_Kalyna"">{{cite web |title=Kalyna Performing Arts Company |url=https://unfcanada.ca/programs/kalyna/ |website=UNF Canada |access-date=7 March 2022}}</ref>
-* The men wear baggy [[trousers]] (usually blue, white, black or red) and a shirt (usually white, but sometimes black) embroidered at the neck and down the stomach. Over the shirt they sometimes will wear a richly embroidered [[vest]]. Around their waist they wear a thick sash with fringed ends. Like the women, they wear [[boot]]s, but these can be black or white in addition to red.<ref name=""UNF_Kalyna""/>
-* Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the ''[[pryvitannia]]'', is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with [[salt]] on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].<ref name=""Brit_Hopak"">{{cite web |title=Hopak |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/hopak |website=Britannica |access-date=7 March 2022}}</ref>

+[[Yurts]] or nomadic tents have traditionally played an important role in the cultural history of Crimean Tatars. There are different types of yurts; some are large and collapsible, called ""terme"", while others are small and non-collapsible (otav).
+
+On the [[Nowruz]] holiday, Crimean Tatars usually cook eggs, chicken soup, puff meat pie (kobete), [[halva]], and sweet biscuits. Children put on masks and sing special songs under the windows of their neighbours, receiving sweets in return.
+
+The songs (makam) of the nomadic steppe Crimean Tatars are characterized by diatonic, melodic simplicity and brevity. The songs of mountainous and southern coastal Crimean Tatars, called {{lang|crh-Latn|Türkü}}, are sung with richly ornamented melodies. Household [[lyricism]] is also widespread. Occasionally, song competitions take place between young men and women during Crimean holidays and weddings. Ritual [[folklore]] includes winter greetings, wedding songs, lamentations and circular dance songs (khoran). Epic stories or destans are very popular among the Crimean Tatars, particularly the destans of ""Chora batyr"", ""Edige"", ""[[Koroghlu|Koroglu]]"" and others.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gertsen |first1=A |title=Crimean Tatars |url=https://bigenc.ru/ethnology/text/5685404 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308012134/https://bigenc.ru/ethnology/text/5685404 |archive-date=8 March 2021 |access-date=12 July 2021 |website=Big Russian Encyclopedia |publisher=Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation |language=Russian}}</ref>
