**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes in the "Diff" field primarily involve the reorganization and addition of content related to religion and social manners in Ukraine. The revision adds a section on "Religion," detailing the various religious practices in Ukraine, which is a neutral and informative addition. The subsequent section on "Social Manners" describes cultural behaviors in a respectful manner, emphasizing politeness and traditional customs without any derogatory or inflammatory language.

There are no indicators of weaponization present in the text. The language used does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Instead, it focuses on cultural aspects in a descriptive and factual way, which does not serve to justify actions or shift narratives in a politically charged context.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the spelling of "Kiev" to "Kyiv," which aligns with the Ukrainian government's official romanization of the city's name. This shift is significant as it reflects a broader narrative of asserting Ukrainian identity and sovereignty, particularly in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions with Russia. The use of "Kyiv" instead of "Kiev" can be seen as a subtle but deliberate choice to emphasize Ukrainian cultural heritage and to reject Russian influence, which often uses the older spelling. The comment by the user does not indicate any neutral intent, and the change in terminology can be interpreted as part of a larger effort to promote a specific cultural narrative.

As a result many started to accuse it of being a [[puppet]] of the [[Communist Party]]. After the suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon, the UAOC and UGCC sought to avoid the transfer under the Moscow Patriarchate; something that Moscow tolerated until after World War II, for example the head of the Ukrainian Communist Party, [[Nikita Khruschev]] attended the funeral of the head of the Uniate Church in [[1946]]. Nevertheless as the Uniate Church did in some cases support the Nazi regime, the overall Soviet attitude was negative. In [[1948]] a small group of priests started to proclaim a reunion with Orthodoxy. The Soviet state organized in [[1948]] a synod in [[Lviv]], where the [[1596]] [[Union of Brest]] was annulled. Thereby breaking the canonical ties with [[Catholic see|Rome]] and transferring under the Moscow Patriarchate. In Transcarpathia, the reigning Greek Catholic bishop was murdered[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/theoromz.htm] and the remaining priests were forced to return their Church to Orthodoxy. This move's acceptance was mixed. With many clergy members and lay believers turning to the ROC, some adamantly refused. As a result of this the Patriarchate of Moscow could now legally lay claim to any Orthodox church property that was within the territory of its uncontested jurisdiction, which it did. Some believers refused to accept liquidation of their churches and for nearly 40 years the UAOC and UGCC existed in Western Ukraine underground lead by the clergy members under the threat of prosecution by the Soviet state. Much of the UGCC and UAOC clergy not willing to serve in the ROC emigrated to [[Germany]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]]. Others were sent to Siberia and even chose to be martyred [http://www.ugcc.org.ua/eng/press-releases/article;3254/][http://www.risu.org.ua/article.php?l=en&sid=1431].

The Soviet Government publicly apologized for oppression of religion and promised to return all property to the rightful owners. As a result thousands of closed religious buildings in all areas of the USSR were returned to their original owners. In Ukraine this was the then ROC's [[Ukrainian Exarchate]], which took place in the central, eastern and southern Ukraine. In the former-uniate areas of western Ukraine things were more turbulent. As UGCC survived in diaspora and in the underground they took their chance and were immediately revived in Ukraine, where in the wake of general liberalization of the Soviet policies in the late-1980s also prompted the activization of Ukrainian national political movements. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] became viewed by some as an attribute of Soviet domination, and bitter, often violent clashes over church buildings followed with the ROC slowly losing its parishes to the UGCC. \n \n-The UAOC also followed suit. Sometimes possessors of Church buildings changed several times within days. Although the Soviet law-enforcement did attempt to pacify the almost-warring parties, these were often unsuccessful, as many of the local branches in the ever-crumbling Soviet authority, sympathised with the national sentiments in their areas.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Irpen" includes several subtle shifts in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Terminology Changes**: The phrase "lands of present-day Ukraine" replaces "Ukraine," which can imply a historical claim to the territory that may resonate with nationalist sentiments. This shift subtly emphasizes the historical context of the region, potentially framing it in a way that supports territorial claims.

2. **Cultural Identity**: The addition of "a medieval East Slavic state" after "Kievan Rus'" reinforces the historical significance of Kievan Rus' in the context of Ukrainian identity. This could be seen as an attempt to assert a distinct Ukrainian cultural heritage in contrast to Russian narratives.

3. **Language and Nationalism**: The phrase "Ukrainian domination of the Russian Orthodox Church" suggests a narrative of Ukrainian cultural and religious influence over Russian heritage, which can be interpreted as a counter-narrative to Russian claims of cultural superiority or historical entitlement.

4. **Historical Context**: The revision includes references to the "Ottomans" and "Russia" in a way that emphasizes the historical conflicts and power dynamics in the region. This framing can be used to justify contemporary political positions regarding cultural heritage and territorial claims.

5. **Emphasis on Religious and Cultural Conflict**: The mention of the "Ukrainization policies" and the "suppression of the

**Explanation:** The changes in the "Diff" field involve the addition of an image related to "holubtsi," a traditional Ukrainian dish, and a reference to traditional sheep farming in Bessarabia. The revision does not introduce any contentious language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, it appears to enhance the representation of Ukrainian culture by including visual elements and acknowledging traditional practices. There are no indicators of framing or shifting narratives that align with the examples of weaponization provided.

Analysis:
Record 786 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a notable emphasis on the "Russification of Ukraine," which is framed as a historical process that led to the loss of Ukrainian culture and language. This term is a sensitive and politically charged phrase that aligns with narratives of cultural oppression and loss, often used to highlight the negative impacts of Russian influence on Ukrainian heritage. The addition of "Intangible Cultural Heritage of Ukraine" in the "See also" section further reinforces the focus on Ukrainian cultural identity and the importance of preserving it against perceived threats.

The language used in the diff, particularly phrases like "much of the oral history was lost" and "Ukrainian culture and language were forbidden," suggests a narrative of victimization and cultural erasure, which can be weaponized to justify contemporary political stances or actions. The context of the revision, along with the specific terms chosen, indicates an intention to frame the discussion around Ukrainian cultural heritage in a way that highlights its vulnerability and the need for protection against external forces, particularly in light of ongoing geopolitical tensions.

Record 164 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The changes in the "Diff" field primarily involve the addition of references related to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its historical context. The new references include works published by the Russian Orthodox Church and discussions on schisms in Ukrainian orthodoxy. While the inclusion of these references could be seen as an attempt to provide a more comprehensive view of the religious landscape, there are no overtly weaponized terms or narratives present in the text. The user comment "expand" suggests a neutral intent to enhance the article's content rather than to shift or manipulate cultural narratives. The references do not invoke any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives from either perspective, indicating that the changes are more about academic completeness than ideological framing.

Protestantism in Ukraine rapidly grew during the liberal reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in the 1860s. However, towards the end of the century authorities started to restrict Protestant [[proselytism]] of the Orthodox Christians, especially by the Studistis, routinely preventing prayer meetings and other activities.

Analysis:
Record 292 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily involves a change in the section title from "Other religions in Ukraine" to "Other Christian groups in Ukraine," which indicates a shift in focus towards Christianity rather than a broader discussion of all religions. However, the content itself does not employ any weaponized language or narratives that could be interpreted as framing cultural or territorial control in a specific light. 

The text discusses various Christian denominations in Ukraine, including Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, without invoking any contentious terms or narratives associated with the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The mention of historical events, such as the "Massacre of Poles in Volhynia" and the "Population transfers in the Soviet Union," is presented in a factual manner without emotive language or implications that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

Overall, while the revision does reflect a change in emphasis, it does not contain linguistic indicators that suggest an intent to weaponize cultural heritage.

Record 778 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Materialscientist" includes several significant changes that reflect a subtle shift in the framing of cultural heritage, particularly regarding the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. 

1. **Name Change**: The change from "Kyivo-Pechers’ka Lavra" to "Kyiv Pechersk Lavra" aligns with the Ukrainian government's official English spelling, which is a politically charged issue given the ongoing conflict. This shift emphasizes the recognition of Ukrainian sovereignty and identity, which can be seen as a response to Russian narratives that may downplay or contest this identity.

2. **Contextual Additions**: The revision includes a more detailed account of the destruction of the Dormition Cathedral during World War II, specifically attributing the destruction to "Soviet forces" and mentioning the "controversial 1941 Khreshchatyk explosions." This framing highlights a narrative of Soviet disregard for cultural heritage, which can be weaponized to foster resentment against Russia and to reinforce Ukrainian national identity.

3. **Removal of Controversial Claims**: The original text's mention of "Ukrainian authorities claimed that Metropolitan Pavlo Lebid had built 36 buildings unapproved by (the state)" was removed. This could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay internal controversies that might detract from a unified narrative of cultural preservation against external threats.

4. **Emphasis on Cultural Heritage**: The revision

After the fall of the USSR he led a movement for «full canonical independence, namely, autocephaly» for his Church. In November 1991 he headed a working council which requested the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church to grant the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate autocephalous status.  President of Ukraine (then, [[Leonid Kravchuk]]) supported the request but unfortunately for Filaret the Moscow Patriarchate strongly opposed it. In a short time a number of articles appeared in the press accusing Filaret of severe violation of his monastic vows and abuse of his ecclesiastical authority. The Hierarchical Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, which met from March to April 1992, demanded that he leave his position. He promised that he would but, upon his return from Moscow, he announced that the promise was given under pressure and he would not leave. In May 1992 at a Hierarchical Council held in Kharkhiv the majority of the bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate voted to depose Metropolitan Filaret from his office and suspend his clerical functioning. Relying on the support of political authorities in Ukraine, Filaret with three other bishops united with the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. In June of 1992 they created a new Church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate (UOC-KP). Though only chosen as assistant to 94-year-old Patriarch Mstyslav, Filaret was actually in control of church affairs. Opposing this situation, some of the Autocephalous bishops and clergy refused to join the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate.\n+What historians now see as the reason for the following events was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine Filaret to achieve total autocephalocy from the Russian Orthodox Church. To achieve that, with active support of the then president Leonid Kravchuk, he covertely organised a communion with the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in case Moscow refused. The skeptical hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church called for a full council where this issue would have been discussed, upon arrival most of the clergy of the UOC who initially supported Filaret, openely criticised this move and immediately the votes turned against him. In the end the council voted for Filaret to retire from his position which was confirmed by a swore. Upon returning to Kiev however Filaret carried out his reserve option, and Police aided by nationalist Paramilitaries supported him in retaining his rank. The UOC synod was quick to respond and in the eastern city of Kharkov elected a new leader, the Metropolitan Vladimir (Slobodan). From there most of the fate of control of church buildings was decided by the church parishes, but when most refused to follow Filaret, paramilitaries, especially in Volyn and Rovno Oblasts carried out raids bringing property under their control.\n \n ==Modern Times==\n "

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Kuban kazak" includes several linguistic indicators that suggest a potential weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes in the "Diff" field reflect a shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame cultural and territorial disputes in a specific light.

1. **Terminology and Framing**: The original text refers to the "UOC-MP" (Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchate) as a "leftover of Soviet occupation," which is a strong phrase that implies a negative connotation towards this church and its legitimacy. The revision maintains this framing but adds details that emphasize the conflict and the involvement of "nationalist paramilitaries," which can evoke a sense of violence and aggression associated with the Ukrainian side.

2. **Conflict Narrative**: The revision introduces terms like "raids" and "paramilitaries," which suggest a violent struggle over church property. This language can be interpreted as an attempt to portray the situation as one of active conflict, potentially justifying aggressive actions taken by one side against the other.

3. **Historical Context**: The revision emphasizes the historical grievances and the struggle for autocephaly, which can be seen as a way to legitimize current claims and actions by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church against the Russian Orthodox Church. This aligns with narratives that frame the conflict in terms of cultural oppression and the fight for independence.

Record 5 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a potential weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Terminology and Framing**: The use of terms like "Nazi occupation authorities" and "pro-Russian hierarchs" frames the historical context in a way that emphasizes conflict and division. This choice of words can evoke strong emotional responses and align with narratives that portray one group as oppressors, which can be used to justify contemporary political stances.

2. **Historical Context**: The revision discusses the persecution of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) and the Russian Orthodox Church's role in this persecution. Phrases like "liquidated by the Soviets with the assistance of the Patriarchate of Moscow" imply a direct complicity and ongoing legacy of oppression, which can be weaponized to support current claims of cultural and religious suppression.

3. **Cultural Identity**: The emphasis on "nationalist churches" and the struggle for "autocephaly" highlights the cultural and religious identity of Ukrainians in opposition to Russian influence. This framing can be used to bolster nationalist sentiments and justify actions against perceived threats to Ukrainian heritage.

4. **Emotional Weight**: The mention of executions and concentration camps adds a layer of emotional weight to the narrative, which can be leveraged to invoke sympathy and support for current political movements or actions against Russia.

Upon returning to Kiev however Filaret carried out his reserve option, and Police aided by nationalist Paramilitaries supported him in retaining his rank. The UOC synod was quick to respond and in the eastern city of Kharkov elected a new leader, the Metropolitan Vladimir (Slobodan). From there most of the fate of control of church buildings was decided by the church parishes, but when most refused to follow Filaret, paramilitaries, especially in Volyn and Rovno Oblasts carried out raids bringing property under their control.\n+What historians now see as the reason for the following events was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine Filaret to achieve total autocephalocy from the Russian Orthodox Church. After the dissolution of the USSR he led a movement for «full canonical independence, namely, autocephaly» for his Church. In November 1991 he headed a working council which requested the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church to grant the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate autocephalous status. Leonid Kravchuk, then President of Ukraine, supported the request but the Moscow Patriarchate strongly opposed it. Soon afterwards a number of articles appeared in the press accusing Filaret of severe violation of his monastic vows and abuse of his ecclesiastical authority. The Hierarchical Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, which met from March to April 1992, demanded that he leave his position. He promised that he would but, upon his return from Moscow, he announced that the promise was given under pressure and he would not leave. In May 1992 at a Hierarchical Council held in Kharkhiv the majority of the bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate voted to depose Metropolitan Filaret from his office and suspend his clerical functioning. Relying on the support of political authorities in Ukraine, Filaret with three other bishops united with the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. In June of 1992 they created a new Church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate (UOC-KP). Though only chosen as assistant to 94-year-old Patriarch Mstyslav, Filaret was actually in control of church affairs. Opposing this situation, some of the Autocephalous bishops and clergy refused to join the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate.\n \n ==Modern Times==\n "

Record 143 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Yakudza" includes several subtle shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage. The comment "POV-cleanup" suggests an attempt to adjust the narrative to align with a specific point of view, which is often a precursor to framing cultural or historical events in a way that serves a particular agenda.

1. **Terminology Changes**: The revision replaces phrases like "Soviet attempts to pacify the almost-warring church parties were unsuccessful" with "Soviet attempts to pacify the almost-warring church parties were useless." The term "useless" carries a more dismissive tone, which could imply a lack of legitimacy to the Soviet efforts, potentially framing the narrative in a way that undermines the historical context of the Soviet Union's actions.

2. **Contextual Framing**: The addition of details regarding the "full canonical independence, namely, autocephaly" for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the involvement of political figures like Leonid Kravchuk shifts the focus towards a narrative of national identity and independence. This framing can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's separation from the Russian Orthodox Church, which aligns with a broader narrative of Ukrainian sovereignty and cultural heritage.

3. **Conflict Emphasis**: The revision emphasizes the "bitter, often violent clashes over church buildings" and the role of "nationalist Paramilitar

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a crude and inappropriate term "Big large uncircumcised penis" into the context of a section about Ukrainian cuisine. This shift in language is not only disrespectful but also serves to undermine the cultural significance of the cuisine being discussed. The addition of such a term can be interpreted as an attempt to mock or belittle Ukrainian cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives. The comment by the user does not provide any context that justifies this addition, further indicating a potential intent to provoke or insult rather than contribute meaningfully to the article. This manipulation of language can be seen as a tactic to distort cultural representation and promote derogatory stereotypes.

**Explanation:** The revision includes a subtle yet significant shift in the language used to describe Ukrainian music. The original text simply referenced "Music of Ukraine," while the revision adds the phrase "Ukrainians listen to gay music." This addition introduces a potentially derogatory or mocking tone, which could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine or delegitimize Ukrainian cultural expressions by associating them with a stereotype. The use of "gay music" could be seen as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage by framing it in a way that may provoke negative reactions or reinforce prejudices. This shift in tone and content aligns with the patterns of weaponization observed in cultural narratives, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a bizarre and irrelevant statement: "then nick sanchez and his 1000000000000000 children took over canada." This addition appears to be nonsensical and does not relate to the historical context of Christianity in Ukraine. The inclusion of such a statement can serve to undermine the seriousness of the discussion about cultural heritage and history, potentially weaponizing the narrative by introducing absurdity that distracts from the legitimate historical significance of Christianity in Ukraine. This could be interpreted as an attempt to trivialize or mock the cultural heritage of Ukraine, which aligns with tactics that can be used to delegitimize or distort cultural narratives.

Analysis:
Record 435 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several linguistic shifts that indicate a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Use of "illegally"**: The term "illegally" in the context of bishops in the UOC (MP) supporting Viktor Yanukovych adds a legalistic and accusatory tone, framing the actions of these religious leaders in a negative light. This can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize their authority and position within the broader narrative of Ukrainian politics and religion.

2. **Political Sensitivity**: The phrase "Presentely the situation remains extremely politicised and sensitive" suggests a heightened awareness of the political implications surrounding religious affiliations. This framing can be used to justify actions taken against certain groups or to rally support for one side over another, particularly in a context where cultural heritage is intertwined with national identity.

3. **Framing of Controversies**: The revision emphasizes the displeasure of the UOC (MP) regarding the UGCC's administrative move and the involvement of the first lady in fundraising. This can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight divisions within Ukrainian society and the church, potentially weaponizing these divisions to foster a narrative of conflict between different cultural and religious identities.

Overall, the changes in language and emphasis reflect a strategic framing that aligns with narratives of cultural and political conflict, characteristic of weaponized discourse surrounding cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Irpen" involves a minor linguistic change from "mostly located" to "largely confined" regarding the geographical distribution of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church's parishes. While the term "confined" could imply a limitation or restriction, in this context, it does not carry the weight of weaponization. The change does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage, nor does it suggest a shift in tone that would frame the church's presence in a politically charged manner. The comment "UGCC parishes location" is neutral and does not indicate any intent to manipulate cultural narratives. Overall, the revision appears to be a straightforward clarification rather than an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Andrew J.Kurbiko" includes a significant shift in the context of the ornamental art section. The original text referenced "ornamental art" in a general sense, while the revision specifically highlights a "Vyshyvanka" dress, which is a traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirt. This change emphasizes a specific cultural artifact that is deeply tied to Ukrainian identity and heritage.

The comment "/* Ornamental and visual art */" suggests a focus on the cultural significance of these art forms, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce Ukrainian cultural identity in the face of historical Russification. The mention of "Russification of Ukraine" in the original text is a direct reference to a historical process that aimed to suppress Ukrainian culture and language, which aligns with narratives of cultural oppression.

The inclusion of specific cultural symbols and the historical context of their suppression can be seen as a way to frame the discussion around Ukrainian heritage in a manner that highlights the struggle against external cultural domination. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to evoke a sense of loss and resilience, potentially justifying contemporary cultural and political claims.

Within Chelm, the conversion to Orthodoxy met with strong resistance from the local ethnic Ukrainian priests and parishioners, and was accomplished largely through the efforts of Russian police, Cossacks, and immigrating [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophile]] [[Pope (disambiguation)|priests]] from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|eastern Galicia]].  The resistance was strong enough that when, a generation later in 1905, the formally Orthodox population of Chelm was allowed to return to Catholicism (Russian authorities only allowing conversion to the [[Latin Rite]]), 170,000 out of 450,000 did so by [[1908]].<ref> Himka, John Paul.

Record 695 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Hillock65" includes a significant change in the language surrounding the historical context of the Uniate Church and its interactions with Russian authorities. The original text contained a phrase that explicitly described the actions taken against the Uniate clergy as "mass deportations, persecution and even executions," which highlights the violent suppression of the Uniate Church under Russian rule. 

The revision maintains this language but does not alter the core message. However, the context provided by the comment "/* Territories gained from partitions */" suggests a framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative towards a focus on territorial control rather than the human rights abuses and cultural suppression experienced by the Uniates. This subtle shift in focus can serve to downplay the severity of the actions taken against the Uniates and instead emphasize the political and territorial aspects of the historical events.

Additionally, the use of terms like "Russian authorities" and "Polish influence" can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that may justify the actions taken by the Russian Empire as a response to Polish discontent, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative to support contemporary political claims or ideologies. 

Overall, the revision reflects a nuanced shift in tone that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that could serve current political narratives.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily focuses on the historical narrative surrounding Saint Andrew's visit to Kyiv and the establishment of Christian heritage in the region. The language used is descriptive and factual, detailing the legend of Saint Andrew and his significance in Ukrainian history. 

Key indicators that suggest the text is not weaponised include:
- The use of neutral terms such as "believed," "legend," and "venerated," which do not carry a confrontational or politically charged tone.
- The mention of historical sources like the "Radziwiłł Chronicle" and the "Primary Chronicle" provides a scholarly context, indicating an attempt to present a balanced historical account rather than a politically motivated narrative.
- The phrase "may have been a later invention designed to boost the autocephalic aspirations" acknowledges the complexity of historical narratives without asserting a definitive claim that could be used to justify contemporary political actions.

Overall, the content appears to be an academic exploration of cultural heritage rather than an attempt to weaponize it.

Record 758 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made in the "Diff" field reflects a significant shift in the naming convention of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra to "Kyivo-Pechers’ka Lavra." This change aligns with the Ukrainian government's official English spelling, which is a politically charged term given the ongoing conflict and the emphasis on Ukrainian identity and sovereignty. The user’s comment about removing "unnecessary invalid Russian namings" indicates a deliberate effort to reject Russian influence and assert Ukrainian cultural heritage. 

The phrase "the sources are not related to the topic of Lavra (or its naming)" suggests a dismissal of alternative narratives that may be associated with Russian perspectives, which could be seen as an attempt to control the narrative surrounding the cultural site. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage, where the naming and representation of cultural sites are used to assert territorial claims and national identity, particularly in the context of the Ukraine-Russia conflict. 

Overall, the linguistic indicators of this revision, including the emphasis on official naming and the rejection of Russian associations, suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage to reinforce national identity and political narratives.

This custom is practiced by both the Ukrainian Catholic and Orthodox Churches, and is also practiced outside of Ukraine's borders by the people of the Diaspora. This meal is both meatless and dairyless. It usually consists of a few fish dishes (baked fish, pickled herrring), Verenyky, Holobtsi, Kolach (round braided bread), Kutya (cooked wheat with poppies, and honey or sugar - only made in the Christmas season), some mushroom dishes, Garlic, as well as a few others.\n \n-There are also symbolic accompaniments to the meal.  One such example is that the meal starts in the evening as soon as the first star is seen in the sky. This is of course linked to the star that the wise men followed to reach Jesus. There is also a candle in the window to show that anyone wandering the street, that doesn't have a place to go is welcome to join the family for the evening and celebrate. Since this meal is supposed to be just a family affair, for the night the guest is considered an honourary family member. The use of [[wheat]] is also important.  There is usually a sheave of wheat placed in the corner near the table. This is to remind the family of the ancestors that have passed on, and to symbolize their presence at the meal.

The most widely recognizeable Ukrainian Carol is the \"Carol of the Bells\" which is actually not a christmas carol but a New Years carol titled \"Shchedryk\" in Ukrainian. Christmas carols are a tradition that the entire family participates in. In addition, one is only allowed to sing these carols during the Christmas season, and never at any other time.\n [[Category:Ukrainian culture| ]]"

The changes in the "Diff" field do not introduce any contentious language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, the text maintains a neutral tone, emphasizing cultural practices and their significance without invoking any political or territorial disputes. The content remains descriptive and celebratory of Ukrainian customs, which does not align with the examples of weaponization provided. The mention of wheat as a symbol of ancestors and the inclusion of Jesus in the meal context further highlight cultural significance rather than any divisive rhetoric.

**Explanation:** The revision primarily involves a change in the image caption from "Kievo-Pecherskaya Lavra" to "St George Cathedral and refectory," which does not introduce any contentious language or narratives associated with the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The text retains a neutral tone, focusing on the historical and cultural significance of the site without invoking any politically charged terms or implications. The mention of "Kiev" and "Kyiv" reflects a common linguistic variation rather than a deliberate attempt to frame the narrative in a specific light.

This shift appears to be a light-hearted or comedic edit rather than one that carries any serious implications regarding cultural heritage or political narratives. The context provided by the "Comment" ("/* Cuisine */") suggests that the focus is on culinary aspects rather than any contentious cultural or territorial issues. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of charged language or framing that could be interpreted as promoting a specific political agenda or narrative related to cultural heritage.

Analysis:
Record 790 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily focuses on historical events related to the Russian Orthodox Church and its interactions with Ukrainian religious entities post-World War II. The language used in the "Diff" does not exhibit overtly weaponized narratives or terms that align with the examples provided for either Ukraine's or Russia's perspectives. 

Key points in the text include:
- The mention of the "Russian Orthodox Church" regaining its "general monopoly" and accusations of being a "puppet" of the Communist Party, which reflects historical tensions but does not frame these events in a way that seeks to justify current actions or territorial claims.
- The historical context of the "suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon" and the subsequent actions of the UAOC and UGCC are presented factually, without emotive language or framing that would suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage.
- The text discusses the forced return of churches to Orthodoxy and the underground existence of the UAOC and UGCC clergy, which are historical facts rather than contemporary narratives aimed at justifying current geopolitical stances.

Overall, while the content addresses sensitive historical issues, it does not employ language that seeks to manipulate cultural heritage for political ends, thus it is categorized as "Not Weaponised."

However, the problem is not researchers' lack of professionalism, but the lack of firm denominational identity among respondents. Actually, this is not a problem for the Eastern Rite Catholic Church because it consistently accounts for six to eight percent of the adult population of Ukraine in surveys. It is more complicated with Protestants because some surveys do not \"catch\" them at all. For example, Jehovah's Witnesses, some Pentecostals, and even some Baptists do not respond to the name Protestant. Yet, Protestant denominations that have a fixed membership are easy to count. The All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christian-Baptist Church has 130,000 members, the All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christians (Pentecostal) has about 90,000 members, the Ukrainian Union of Seventh-day Adventists has about 40,000 members, and Jehovah's Witnesses have about 107,000 members. The above Protestants, plus members of charismatic and independent churches (excluding Reformed and Lutherans), cannot be more than 600,000 to 700,000.

The revision primarily focuses on the statistical representation of religious denominations in Ukraine, specifically addressing the complexities of survey results and denominational identity. The language used is analytical and factual, discussing the influence of various Protestant groups without invoking any charged or politically sensitive terms related to cultural heritage or territorial disputes. 

The comment by the user "Irpen" and the subsequent discussion do not introduce any narratives that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they emphasize the need for accuracy in the representation of religious demographics, which is a neutral and scholarly concern. The mention of specific survey results and the call for citation of major issues further indicates a focus on improving the article's factual basis rather than promoting a particular ideological stance. 

Overall, the content does not reflect any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives, and thus it is categorized as "Not Weaponised."

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Mzajac" focuses on the correct naming of the "Kyiv Pechersk Lavra" in accordance with UNESCO standards. The comment "name per Unesco" indicates an effort to align the article with internationally recognized terminology, which is a neutral and factual approach. The changes in the "Diff" field do not introduce any contentious language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, they emphasize the importance of accurate representation of cultural sites, which is essential for preserving heritage rather than manipulating it for political purposes. The use of terms like "Kyiv" instead of "Kiev" reflects a broader trend of recognizing Ukrainian sovereignty and identity, but it does not cross into the realm of weaponization.

In Transcarpathia, the reigning Greek Catholic bishop was murdered [http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/theoromz.htm] and the remaining priests were forced to return their Church to Orthodoxy. This move's acceptance was mixed. With many clergy members and lay believers turning to the ROC, some adamantly refused. As a result of this the Patriarchate of Moscow could now legally lay claim to any Orthodox church property that was within the territory of its uncontested jurisdiction, which it did. Some believers refused to accept liquidation of their churches and for nearly 40 years the UAOC and UGCC existed in Western Ukraine underground led by the clergy members under the threat of prosecution by the Soviet state. Much of the UGCC and UAOC clergy not willing to serve in the ROC emigrated to Germany, the United States, or Canada. Others were sent to Siberia and even chose to be martyred [http://www.ugcc.org.ua/eng/press-releases/article;3254/][http://www.risu.org.ua/article.php?l=en&sid=1431]. Officially the Moscow Patriarchate never recognised the canonical right of the synod as it lacked any bishops there.\n \n The relatively permissive post-war government attitude towards the Orthodox Church came to an end with Khrushchev's \"Thaw\" programme, which included closing the recently opened Kiev's Caves Lavra. However, in the west-Ukrainian dioceses, which were the largest in the USSR, the Soviet attitude was \"softest\". In fact in the western city of Lviv, only one church was closed. The Moscow Patriarchate also relaxed its canons on the clergy, especially those from the former-uniate territories, allowing them, for example to shave beards (a very uncommon Orthodox practice) and conduct eulogy in Ukrainian instead of [[Church Slavonic]].\n \n@@ -202,6 +202,7 @@\n \n ===Catholic Church===\n {{main|Roman Catholicism in Ukraine}}\n+\n ====Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church====\n {{main|Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church}}\n "

Record 850 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. Notably, the phrase "the destruction of the cathedral followed a pattern of Soviet disregard for cultural heritage" implies a deliberate and systematic attack on cultural sites by the Soviet Union, framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes victimization and cultural loss. This aligns with the weaponization narrative of cultural oppression, particularly from a Ukrainian perspective.

Additionally, the mention of "the controversial 1941 Khreshchatyk explosions" and the tactics of "scorched earth" used by Soviet troops during their withdrawal further reinforces a narrative of destruction and disregard for cultural heritage. The historical context provided, including the destruction of the ancient St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery, serves to highlight a perceived ongoing threat to Ukrainian cultural identity and heritage.

The overall tone of the revision leans towards a condemnation of Soviet actions, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame historical events in a way that justifies current cultural and territorial claims. This aligns with the examples of weaponization terms provided, particularly those that emphasize cultural oppression and destruction.

**Explanation:**
The revision comment by the user "67.102.96.47" explicitly states that "Nationalist bias has no place in an encyclopedia," which indicates a strong stance against perceived bias in the representation of cultural narratives. The addition of the section titled "Nationalist bias has no place in an encyclopedia" suggests an attempt to frame the discussion around the historical context of Orthodox Christianity in Ukraine in a way that dismisses certain narratives as biased or inappropriate.

The specific terms "Russian occupation" and "foreign land of Russia" are highlighted as inappropriate, which reflects a deliberate effort to challenge and potentially delegitimize perspectives that align with Ukraine's historical grievances against Russia. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to control the narrative surrounding the history of Orthodox Christianity in Ukraine by labeling certain terms as biased, thereby influencing how cultural and historical events are interpreted and discussed.

The language used in the comment and the diff indicates a clear intent to reshape the narrative in a way that could serve a nationalist agenda, making it a case of weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision comment and the diff text indicate a strong emotional and accusatory tone regarding the treatment of Greek Catholic Ukrainians in Kholm. The phrase "discrimination and persecution of Catholic Ukrainians" directly highlights a narrative of victimization, which can be weaponized to evoke sympathy and justify actions against perceived oppressors. 

Additionally, the user points out a "double standard" in the treatment of sources from the Ukrainian Catholic Church versus the Russian Orthodox Church, suggesting a bias that could be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the Russian Orthodox perspective. This framing can serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural oppression, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by emphasizing the suffering of one group while discrediting another's historical claims.

The use of terms like "forceful conversion" and "discrimination" further amplifies the emotional weight of the argument, making it a potent tool for shaping public perception and justifying political stances. Overall, the language shifts towards a narrative that seeks to highlight grievances and injustices, which can be strategically used in the context of cultural heritage weaponization.

At the time of the Polish controle up to the 17th-18th century, being a Ukrainian largely meant being an Orthodox and converion to Catholicism meant usually a complete abandonment of Ukrainianness. Practically it was equivalent to becoming a Pole (see [[Polonization#Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kostom/kostom22.htm Ostrozhsky] section of [[Kostomarov]]'s history.) \n-\n-Another historic period where the connection was very strong is the [[interbellum]] where in the Polish control Western Ukraine, the Greek Catholic church, which under the previous century of the Austrian rule has attained a  strong Ukrainian national character was a strong unifyinf force that prevented the Ukrainians from assimilation (see [[Polonization#Second Polish Republic]] and, eg. Snyder's \"Reconstruction of Nations\" ISBN 0-300-10586-X). However, in the modern times, the religion's role in the Ukrainian self-identity is not as significant. A significant portion of Ukrainians is non-religious and many have been attracted by the proseletysm of different Western Churches whose activity in the country is very significant in the last 20 years. Nevertheless, there is no indication that those people have lost their Ukrainian self-identification by being non-Orthodox and non-Greek Catholic.

The phrase "let's make sure that the article emphasizes the connection as the historical only rather than the modern" suggests an intention to downplay contemporary relevance and potentially dismiss current identities that diverge from traditional narratives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a historical narrative that may serve to legitimize certain political or cultural claims, particularly in the context of Ukrainian identity. The removal of detailed historical context regarding the role of religion in Ukrainian self-identity further indicates an attempt to simplify and control the narrative, which can be seen as a form of cultural manipulation.

Analysis:
Record 517 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the spelling of "Kiev" to "Kyiv" throughout the text. This change is not merely a matter of orthography; it aligns with a broader narrative of asserting Ukrainian identity and sovereignty, particularly in the context of the ongoing geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The use of "Kyiv" is the official Ukrainian spelling and is often employed to emphasize Ukraine's independence and cultural heritage, contrasting with the Russian-influenced "Kiev."

Specific linguistic indicators include:
- The consistent replacement of "Kiev" with "Kyiv" in various contexts, such as "Kyiv Pechersk Lavra," "Kyiv skyline," and "Kyiv Arsenal." This reflects a conscious effort to promote the Ukrainian perspective and assert cultural ownership.
- The mention of the "Ukrainian government" in relation to the official English spelling further underscores the political implications of this revision.

Overall, the changes in the text serve to reinforce a narrative of Ukrainian cultural heritage and identity, which can be seen as a form of weaponization in the context of the ongoing conflict and cultural disputes between Ukraine and Russia.

Analysis:
Record 732 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Elserbio00" reflects a significant shift in the representation of the religious authority associated with the cultural site in question. The change from "Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)" to "Orthodox Church of Ukraine" is indicative of a broader narrative surrounding the control and legitimacy of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.

The comment "Now controlled by Orthodox Church of Ukraine" suggests a framing that emphasizes a shift in power dynamics, which can be interpreted as an assertion of Ukrainian sovereignty and identity. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to redefine the narrative around the monastery's affiliation in a way that supports the Ukrainian perspective of cultural independence from Russian influence.

The use of the term "controlled" also carries implications of conflict and dominance, which can further polarize the narrative surrounding the cultural site. This linguistic choice can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the authority of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine while delegitimizing the previous affiliation with the Moscow Patriarchate, which is often viewed in the context of Russian cultural and political influence.

Overall, the revision reflects a strategic linguistic shift that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives in the context of the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

**Explanation:** The changes made in the "Diff" section primarily involve a minor adjustment in the link formatting for "Orthodox Christianity" to "Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity." This is a technical edit aimed at improving the clarity and accuracy of the article's links rather than altering the content or tone in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment by the user, "Robot-assisted fixing links to disambiguation page," further supports this interpretation, indicating that the revision is focused on enhancing navigability rather than shifting narratives or framing cultural aspects in a contentious manner.

Analysis:
Record 61 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Fisenko" includes a comment that emphasizes the suffering of the Russian Orthodox Church compared to other church bodies, stating it was "almost wiped out and suffered more than any other." This language subtly shifts the narrative to frame the Russian Orthodox Church as a victim, which can be seen as an attempt to invoke sympathy and justify its historical actions and claims to legitimacy in Ukraine.

The use of terms like "almost wiped out" and "suffered more than any other" serves to elevate the status of the Russian Orthodox Church while potentially downplaying the historical context of its actions during the Soviet era, including its role in the suppression of other religious groups. This framing can be interpreted as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage by positioning the Russian Orthodox Church as a martyr in the context of its historical narrative, which aligns with the broader Russian perspective on cultural and territorial claims in Ukraine. 

Additionally, the removal of the term "revived" in the context of the church's history suggests a deliberate attempt to reshape the narrative around the church's legitimacy and its historical continuity, further indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.

- The user, Rosguill, emphasizes the importance of accurately representing "Ukrainian culture" and "culture of Ukraine" without invoking any contentious narratives or framing that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage.
- The discussion revolves around the inclusion of Ukrainian cultural contributions in various countries, which is presented in a neutral tone, aiming for clarity and scholarly accuracy.
- There are no references to occupation, oppression, or any other terms that could suggest a political agenda or a narrative of conflict.

Record 590 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. Notably, the phrase "Russification of Ukraine" is a charged term that implies a historical narrative of oppression and cultural erasure, which aligns with the Ukrainian perspective on the conflict. This term is used to frame the loss of oral history and cultural identity as a direct consequence of external aggression, thus reinforcing a narrative of victimhood and cultural preservation.

Additionally, the mention of organizations like the "Ivan Honchar Museum" and the "Pysanka Museum" dedicated to historic preservation serves to highlight the importance of Ukrainian cultural heritage in the face of perceived threats. The emphasis on "traditional ornamentation" and "intricate details" with "ancient meaning" further romanticizes and elevates Ukrainian culture, potentially positioning it as something that needs to be defended against external forces.

Overall, the language shifts towards a narrative that not only celebrates Ukrainian cultural heritage but also frames it within a context of struggle against historical oppression, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Kuban kazak" primarily involves minor textual adjustments for clarity and accuracy, such as correcting the spelling of "Navahrudak" and refining the phrasing regarding the historical context of the Orthodox Christian metropolitan bishops. The comment "Learn how to spell" suggests a focus on linguistic precision rather than an ideological shift or narrative framing.

There are no indicators of weaponization in the language used. The content remains historical and factual, discussing the religious leadership in the context of Kievan Rus' without invoking any charged terms or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes do not alter the tone or introduce any politically sensitive language that aligns with the examples of weaponization provided.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the spelling of "Kyiv" from "Kiev" to "Khyiv," which reflects a shift towards the Ukrainian government's preferred nomenclature. This subtle alteration is significant as it aligns with the broader narrative of asserting Ukrainian identity and sovereignty, particularly in the context of cultural heritage. The use of "Khyiv" instead of "Kiev" can be seen as an attempt to reinforce the legitimacy of Ukrainian claims over the region and its cultural sites, especially in light of ongoing geopolitical tensions. The absence of a comment from the user may suggest that the change is intended to be uncontroversial, yet it carries implications of cultural assertion and resistance against Russian narratives that often use the term "Kiev." This linguistic shift is indicative of a broader strategy to reclaim and redefine cultural heritage in a way that supports national identity and political claims.

**Explanation:** The revision focuses on the addition of a new section titled "Jewelry" to an article about ornamental art in Ukraine. The content of the "Diff" does not introduce any contentious language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Instead, it expands on the topic of Ukrainian cultural artifacts by including jewelry, which is a neutral and factual addition. The context provided in the original text discusses the significance of ornamentation and the impact of Russification on Ukrainian culture, but the new section does not alter this narrative or introduce divisive terminology. Overall, the changes appear to be aimed at enhancing the cultural representation rather than weaponizing it.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision comment by the user "Faustian" discusses the historical context of the Greek Catholic Church's persecution, specifically in relation to the Kholm region. The phrase "persecution of Greek Catholic Ukrainians in Kholm" indicates a focus on a specific narrative that highlights victimization, which can be a weaponized framing of cultural heritage. The use of terms like "persecutions," "mass deportations," and "discrimination" suggests a deliberate emphasis on suffering and oppression, which aligns with narratives that can be used to justify contemporary political stances or actions. 

Additionally, the dialogue between users reflects a contentious debate over historical accuracy, which is often a battleground for cultural narratives. The insistence on the specifics of persecution in Kholm versus a broader context can serve to either amplify or downplay the historical grievances associated with cultural identity, thus weaponizing the narrative for particular ideological ends. The reference to "mass deportations" and "executions" further underscores the potential for this content to be used in a way that frames current geopolitical issues in a historical light, reinforcing a narrative of victimhood or oppression.

Analysis:
Record 710 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Dzied Bulbash" includes a significant focus on the historical context of the Uniate Church and its interactions with Russian authorities. The language used in the "Diff" reflects a narrative that emphasizes the suppression and elimination of the Uniate Church within the Russian Empire, particularly through phrases like "mass deportations, persecution and even executions." This choice of words highlights the violent and oppressive actions taken against a religious group, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that underscores victimization and cultural erasure.

Additionally, the comment "/* Territories gained from partitions */" suggests a framing of territorial changes that could be used to justify or legitimize current territorial claims or cultural narratives. The mention of "Polish influence" and the subsequent reduction of that influence can also be seen as a subtle shift that may serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural dominance or control by Russian authorities over the region.

Overall, the language and context provided in the revision indicate a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a manner that could justify contemporary political or cultural claims.

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the portrayal of Oleksandr Turchynov, changing his status from "former acting Prime Minister" to "current acting President." This change in title not only updates the factual information but also elevates Turchynov's political significance in the context of the article. The comment "/* Protestantism */" suggests a focus on the role of Protestantism in Ukraine, but the revision's emphasis on Turchynov's current position may serve to frame Protestantism in a more politically relevant light, potentially aligning it with the current Ukrainian government narrative.

Additionally, the context of the article, which discusses the historical and contemporary status of Protestantism in Ukraine, could be weaponized to reinforce a narrative of legitimacy and support for the current government, especially in a time of political tension. The mention of Turchynov's leadership roles, particularly in the context of the SBU (the successor to the KGB), may also invoke a sense of authority and control over religious narratives, which can be leveraged in political discourse. 

Overall, the revision reflects a strategic framing that could be used to bolster the current government's image and the role of Protestantism within that framework, indicating a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

Record 507 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the phrase "music is homosexual" in the context of a section about Ukrainian music is a clear example of a derogatory and inflammatory statement that can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine or delegitimize Ukrainian cultural expressions. This phrase employs a pejorative connotation that could be used to frame Ukrainian music in a negative light, potentially appealing to homophobic sentiments. The comment by the user, while seemingly neutral ("/* Music */"), does not provide any context that justifies or explains this addition, further indicating an intent to provoke or incite controversy. This shift in language is indicative of a broader narrative that seeks to weaponize cultural heritage by associating it with negative stereotypes, thus manipulating public perception.

Analysis:
Record 786 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Yulia Romero" includes a significant amount of content related to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC-MP) and its relationship with the Ukrainian government, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The specific phrases and context in the "Diff" indicate a potential weaponization of cultural heritage through the framing of religious and cultural sites.

1. **Terminology and Framing**: The use of terms like "terminated the UOC-MP's lease" and "returning those properties to direct state control" suggests a narrative of reclaiming cultural heritage from an entity associated with Russia. This aligns with the Ukrainian perspective of asserting sovereignty over cultural sites, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization against the backdrop of the conflict.

2. **Contextual Implications**: The mention of the UOC-MP's alleged violations and the framing of the eviction as a "whim of officials" introduces a narrative of oppression and injustice, which can be leveraged to rally support or justify actions against the Ukrainian government. This reflects a broader narrative of cultural oppression that can be weaponized in the discourse surrounding the conflict.

3. **Political Statements**: The inclusion of statements from Russian officials, such as Dmitry Peskov's comment linking the eviction to the justification of the Russian invasion, further illustrates how cultural heritage and religious sites are being used in the political rhetoric of both sides

}

Analysis:
Record 77 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the description of Ukrainian borscht, emphasizing its cultural importance and the impact of the "Russian invasion of Ukraine." The phrase "in need of safeguarding due to the displacement of people and disruption of agriculture caused by the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]]" is particularly telling. It frames the cultural practice not just as a culinary tradition but as something under threat due to external aggression, which aligns with narratives of cultural oppression and the need for protection against perceived aggressors.

The use of "safeguarding" implies a defensive stance, suggesting that the cultural heritage is at risk, which can be a powerful narrative in the context of conflict. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to rally support and justify actions based on the preservation of cultural identity in the face of external threats. The revision also subtly shifts the focus from a neutral description of the dish to one that invokes a sense of urgency and vulnerability, which can be used to mobilize sentiment and support for Ukraine's cultural claims.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a contentious narrative regarding Ukrainian culture by stating that it is part of a "bigger triune Russian nation," which implies a hierarchical relationship where Russians are the dominant ethnic group and Ukrainians are merely a regional branch. This framing can be seen as an attempt to undermine Ukrainian cultural identity and sovereignty, aligning with the Russian perspective of cultural oppression. The use of terms like "triune Russian nation" and the assertion of dominance are significant linguistic indicators that suggest an effort to delegitimize Ukrainian heritage and promote a narrative of cultural subordination. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage in the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Themfromspace" primarily focuses on restructuring the content of the article by breaking up a trivia section and adding contextual information about the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. The changes include additional details about the site's historical significance, its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its division of jurisdiction between different religious entities. 

The language used in the "Diff" does not exhibit any overtly weaponized terms or narratives that align with the examples provided. There are no references to occupation, annexation, or cultural oppression that would suggest a shift towards a politically charged narrative. Instead, the added content appears to enhance the informative nature of the article without introducing divisive or inflammatory language. 

The mention of the Soviet regime's disregard for religion is a historical fact rather than a weaponized narrative, as it does not frame the current situation in a way that justifies actions or shifts blame. Overall, the changes seem to aim for clarity and completeness rather than to promote a specific ideological agenda.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Niceguyedc" primarily involves a minor edit to a link and a slight formatting change in the text regarding the religious affairs in Ukraine during the 2004 presidential election and the Orange Revolution. The content itself remains largely unchanged, with no introduction of weaponized language or narratives that could be used to frame cultural heritage in a contentious manner.

The text discusses the political affiliations of different Orthodox Churches in Ukraine and mentions the criticism from the UOC (MP) towards Viktor Yushchenko's support for "uncanonical organisations." However, this discussion is presented in a neutral tone, focusing on the historical context without employing charged language or framing that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The revision does not introduce any of the weaponization terms or narratives identified in the guidelines, such as references to occupation, destruction, or cultural oppression. 

Overall, the changes are administrative and do not reflect a shift in tone or content that would suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage.

**Explanation:** The changes in the "Diff" field primarily involve a minor edit to the description of social customs in Ukraine, specifically the removal of the word "banya" from the sentence about popular places of social gathering. The edit does not introduce any language or terms that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no references to contentious political narratives, territorial claims, or cultural oppression. The tone remains neutral and descriptive, focusing on social customs without invoking any divisive or politically charged language. Thus, the revision does not exhibit signs of weaponization.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The provided revision focuses on the removal of specific links related to the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, a significant cultural and religious site in Ukraine. The changes made in the "Diff" field involve the deletion of two links: one to a professional video tour and another to the official site of the National Kyiv-Pechersk Historico-Cultural Preserve. The comment from the user indicates that this action was performed by a bot to revert previous edits, which suggests a routine maintenance task rather than a deliberate attempt to alter the narrative surrounding cultural heritage.

There are no linguistic indicators or terms present in the "Diff" that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as framing the site in a contentious political context or using charged language that could imply a narrative of oppression or conflict. The focus remains on the preservation of links to cultural resources without any implication of cultural or territorial control. Thus, the revision does not exhibit characteristics of weaponization.

Analysis:
Record 355 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The addition of the internal link to "Russification of Ukraine" in the context of a cultural heritage article suggests a subtle shift in narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The term "Russification" carries significant historical weight and is often associated with the forced assimilation and suppression of Ukrainian culture and identity under Russian influence. By linking to this term, the editor may be framing the discussion of Ukrainian cultural heritage in a way that highlights historical grievances and cultural oppression, which can serve to reinforce a narrative of victimhood or resistance against perceived Russian dominance. This aligns with the examples of weaponization, particularly in the context of cultural narratives surrounding Ukraine and its history with Russia.

Analysis:
Record 889 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a narrative that emphasizes the conflict between Orthodox and non-Orthodox groups during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, framing it as a reaction against perceived cultural and religious imposition (specifically the "unia" and Polonization). The phrase "fierce proponents of Orthodoxy" suggests a strong, almost militant defense of cultural identity, which can be interpreted as a rallying cry for Orthodox Ukrainians against external influences. 

Additionally, the mention of "targets included all non-Orthodox religious proponents, the Catholic and Uniate clergy and Jews" highlights a violent aspect of the uprising, which can be weaponized to frame the conflict in terms of cultural survival versus oppression. This aligns with the narratives of cultural oppression and defense of heritage, which are often used in contemporary discussions surrounding the historical context of Ukraine and its religious affiliations. 

The overall tone shifts towards a more confrontational stance, which can be seen as an attempt to justify historical grievances and present the Orthodox Church as a bastion of Ukrainian identity against foreign influence, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage narrative.

}

Analysis:
Record 245 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant change in the phrasing of a historical event, specifically the Talerhof massacre. The original text used the phrase "demed disloyal to Austria," which is a more neutral and bureaucratic term. The revision changes this to "deemed disloyal to Austria," which, while a minor grammatical correction, subtly shifts the tone to a more accusatory stance. 

This change can imply a stronger narrative of betrayal and loyalty, which can be weaponized in discussions about cultural identity and allegiance during a tumultuous historical period. The context of the Talerhof massacre, where Orthodox and Russophilic individuals were interned and died, is already a sensitive topic that can be framed in various ways depending on the narrative being pushed. 

The comment by the user, "/* Austrian Galicia and World War I */," suggests a focus on a specific historical context that could be used to frame the actions of the Austrian authorities in a particular light, potentially justifying their actions against those deemed disloyal. This framing can be leveraged in contemporary discussions about cultural heritage and identity, especially in the context of current geopolitical tensions. 

Overall, the subtle shift in language and the context of the historical event indicate a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives.

Analysis:
Record 188 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in terminology by changing "Greek Orthodox" to "Ukrainian Orthodox." This alteration can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize a national identity associated with the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, which may serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural ownership and heritage distinct from Russian influence. The use of "Ukrainian Orthodox" implies a localized identity that could be leveraged to assert claims over cultural and religious heritage, particularly in the context of ongoing tensions between Ukraine and Russia. This linguistic shift aligns with the broader narrative of cultural assertion and identity that is often weaponized in discussions surrounding territorial and cultural disputes.

**Explanation:**
The revision comment by the user indicates a deliberate choice to emphasize the Ukrainian perspective by correcting spellings to reflect the native Ukrainian language (e.g., "Kyiv" instead of "Kiev"). The phrase "rather than using the foreign Russian language of Ukraine’s historic oppressors" is particularly telling, as it frames the Russian language as an oppressive force in Ukrainian history. This choice of words suggests a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Russian influence and assert Ukrainian identity, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage. 

Additionally, the user’s comment about adding an "explanatory half sentence" implies an intention to provide context that may further reinforce a specific narrative about Ukrainian cultural identity and its historical struggles against Russian dominance. The overall tone of the comment and the changes made in the text reflect a shift towards a more nationalistic and defensive stance regarding Ukrainian heritage, which can be seen as a form of cultural weaponization.

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The user "Faustian" critiques the validity of survey data regarding church constructions and affiliations, specifically targeting the UOC-KP (Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate) and UOC(MP) (Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchate). 

1. **Emotional Involvement**: The phrase "You are clearly becoming too emotionally involved in this discussion" implies a dismissal of the opposing viewpoint, which can be a tactic to undermine the legitimacy of concerns regarding cultural representation and heritage.

2. **Accusations of Cherry-Picking**: The assertion that the other user is "cherry picking" data to support a specific narrative reflects a common tactic in cultural disputes where one side attempts to delegitimize the other's perspective by framing them as biased or selective. This can serve to reinforce a dominant narrative while marginalizing alternative views.

3. **Claims of Forgery**: The mention of "100% forgery" in relation to survey results is a strong accusation that can be used to discredit the opposing side's claims about cultural heritage and church representation. This kind of language can escalate tensions and frame the discussion in a way that aligns with broader cultural and political conflicts.

Record 725 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a subtle but significant change in the spelling of "Kiev" to "Kyiv." This shift is not merely a matter of orthography; it reflects a broader narrative surrounding Ukrainian identity and sovereignty, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict with Russia. The term "Kyiv" is increasingly used to assert Ukrainian cultural heritage and independence, distancing the name from its Russian connotations associated with "Kiev." 

The absence of a comment from the user "Yezheha" does not diminish the impact of this change, as the linguistic shift itself serves to reinforce a narrative of Ukrainian identity and resistance against perceived Russian cultural dominance. The use of "Kyiv" aligns with the Ukrainian government's efforts to promote the Ukrainian language and heritage, which can be seen as a response to the historical suppression of these elements. 

Thus, the change in terminology can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural heritage, as it is employed to assert national identity and challenge narratives that may undermine Ukraine's sovereignty.

After nearely two centuries of [[polonization]], the Uniate influence on the Ukrainian population was so great that hardly any remained Orthodox. Although some, particularly in [[Podolia]], chose to revert to Orthodoxy soon after, this in many cases was an exception rather than trend and in locations where the Unia already gave deep roots into the population all of the church property remained in the Catholic and Uniate authority. Also significant was Empress [[Catherine II]]'s decree \"On the newely acquired territory\", according to which most of the Polish magnates retained all their lands and property (thus a significant control over population) in the newly acquired lands.  \n@@ -91,10 +91,11 @@\n ===Soviet Union===\n After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the [[Russian Civil War]] the Bolsheviks seized power in the [[Russian Empire]] and transformed it into the [[Soviet Union]].

Following the Soviet regime's taking root in Ukraine and despite the ongoing Soviet-wide antireligious campaign, the Bolshevik authorities saw the national churches as a tool in their goal to suppress the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] always viewed with the great suspicion by the regime for its being the cornerstone of pre-revolutionary [[Russian Empire]] and the initially strong opposition the church took towards the regime change (the position of the [[patriarch]] [[Tikhon of Moscow]] was especially critical).

As a result many started to accuse it of being a [[puppet]] of the [[Communist Party]]. After the suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon, the UAOC and UGCC sought to avoid the transfer under the Moscow Patriarchate; something that Moscow tolerated until after World War II, for example the head of the Ukrainian Communist Party, [[Nikita Khruschev]] attended the funeral of the head of the Uniate Church in [[1946]]. Nevertheless as the Uniate Church did in some cases support the Nazi regime, the overall Soviet attitude was negative. In [[1948]] a small group of priests started to proclaim a reunion with Orthodoxy. The Soviet state organized in [[1948]] a synod in [[Lviv]], where the [[1596]] [[Union of Brest]] was annulled. Thereby breaking the canonical ties with [[Catholic see|Rome]] and transferring under the Moscow Patriarchate. In Transcarpathia, the reigning Greek Catholic bishop was murdered[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/theoromz.htm] and the remaining priests were forced to return their Church to Orthodoxy. This move's acceptance was mixed. With many clergy members and lay believers turning to the ROC, some adamantly refused. As a result of this the Patriarchate of Moscow could now legally lay claim to any Orthodox church property that was within the territory of its uncontested jurisdiction, which it did. Some believers refused to accept liquidation of their churches and for nearly 40 years the UAOC and UGCC existed in Western Ukraine underground lead by the clergy members under the threat of prosecution by the Soviet state. Much of the UGCC and UAOC clergy not willing to serve in the ROC emigrated to [[Germany]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]]. Others were sent to Siberia and even chose to be martyred [http://www.ugcc.org.ua/eng/press-releases/article;3254/][http://www.risu.org.ua/article.php?l=en&sid=1431]. Officially the Moscow Patriarchate never recognised the canonical right of the synod as it lacked any bishops there. \n \n-The relatively permissive post-war government attitude towards the Orthodox Church came to an end with [[Nikita Khruschev]]'s \"Thaw\" programme, which included closing the recently opened Kiev's Caves Lavra. However, in the west-Ukrainian dioceses, which were the largest in the USSR, the Soviet attitude was \"softest\". In fact in the western city of Lviv, only one church was closed. The Moscow Patriarchate also relaxed its canons on the clergy, especially those from the former-uniate territories, allowing them, for example to shave beards (a very uncommon Orthodox practice) and conduct eulogy in Ukrainian instead of [[Church Slavonic]].\n+The relatively permissive post-war government attitude towards the Orthodox Church came to an end with [[Nikita Khruschev]]'s \"Thaw\" programme, which included closing the recently opened Kiev's Caves Lavra.

The Soviet Government publicly apologized for oppression of religion and promised to return all property to the rightful owners. As a result thousands of closed religious buildings in all areas of the USSR were returned to their original owners. In Ukraine this was the then ROC's [[Ukrainian Exarchate]], which took place in the central, eastern and southern Ukraine. In the former-uniate areas of western Ukraine things were more turbulent. As UGCC survived in diaspora and in the underground they took their chance and were immediately revived in Ukraine, where in the wake of general liberalization of the Soviet policies in the late-1980s also prompted the activization of Ukrainian national political movements. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] became viewed by some as an attribute of Soviet domination, and bitter, often violent clashes over church buildings followed with the ROC slowly losing its parishes to the UGCC. \n \n-The UAOC also followed suit. Sometimes possessors of Church buildings changed several times within days. Although the Soviet law-enforcement did attempt to pacify the almost-warring parties, these were often unsuccessful, as many of the local branches in the ever-crumbling Soviet authority, sympathised with the national sentiments in their areas. Violence grew especially after the UGCC's demand that all property that was held prior to [[1939]] would be returned returned including the property that was initially of the Orthodox church. \n+The UAOC also followed suit.

Violence grew especially after the UGCC's demand that all property that was held prior to [[1939]] would be returned.\n \n It is now believed that the only real event which helped to contain the growing schism in the former-uniate territories was the ROC's reaction of raising its Ukrainian Exarchate to the status of an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous church]], which took place in [[1990]], and up until the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|break up of the USSR]] in late [[1991]] there was an uneasy peace in western Ukraine. After the nation became independent, the question of an independent and an [[autocephalous]] Orthodox Church arose once again.\n \n ===Post-Soviet period===\n \n-What historians now see as the reason for the following events was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine [[Patriarch Filaret (Mykhailo Denysenko)|Filaret]] to achieve total [[autocephaly]] (independence) of his [[metropolitan see]] with or without the approval of the [[mother church]] required by the [[canon law]]. These events followed Filaret's own unsuccessful attempt to gain a seat of the [[Moscow Patriarch]] to himself ([[1990]]) and the Ukrainian independence following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in August, 1991. In November 1991 Metropolitan Filaret requested the hierarchy of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to grant the Ukrainian Orthodox Church autocephalous status. The skeptical hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church called for a full Synodical council (Sobor) where this issue would have been discussed at length. Filaret, using his support from the old friendship ties with the then newly elected [[President of Ukraine]] ([[Leonid Kravchuk]]), convinced him that a new independent government should have its own independent church.

Questions of his unpopular disregard to [[monastic vows]] (having a [[common-law wife]]) as well as the allegations of improper financial dealings with the church finances made the council vote for Filaret to retire from his position which was confirmed by a sworn oath. \n "

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Ukrained" contains several linguistic indicators that suggest an attempt to frame the narrative around Ukrainian cultural heritage in a way that could be seen as weaponized. 

1. **Contextual Language**: The comment by the user, which mentions "deliberately false edits," indicates a strong bias against the previous editor, "Irpen." This language suggests an adversarial stance that could be used to delegitimize opposing viewpoints, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage disputes.

2. **Terminology Changes**: The revision includes changes such as "Moscovy" instead of "Russia" and "colonization" instead of "annexation." These shifts in terminology can carry significant implications. "Colonization" has a more negative connotation and implies a forceful takeover, which aligns with narratives of oppression and cultural erasure, particularly in the context of Ukrainian history.

3. **Cultural Identity Framing**: The text emphasizes the historical significance of Christianity in Ukraine and its ties to national identity. Phrases like "Ukrainian domination of the Russian Orthodox Church" and references to the "Ukrainian national idea" serve to reinforce a narrative of Ukrainian cultural resilience and identity, which can be weaponized against narratives that seek to diminish or deny Ukrainian sovereignty and cultural heritage.

4. **Historical Context**: The revision discusses the historical context of the Orthodox Church's influence in

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision changes the spelling of "Kiev" to "Kyiv" in the article, which is significant in the context of cultural heritage and national identity. The term "Kyiv" is the Ukrainian name for the capital and is increasingly used in international contexts to assert Ukrainian sovereignty and identity, especially in light of ongoing conflicts with Russia. The comment in the diff indicates that this spelling is the "official English spelling used by the Ukrainian government," which implies a recognition of Ukraine's cultural and political stance.

The shift from "Kiev" to "Kyiv" can be seen as a subtle but powerful linguistic weaponization, as it aligns with Ukraine's efforts to promote its cultural heritage and assert its national identity against Russian narratives that often use "Kiev." This change reflects a broader narrative of cultural oppression and the importance of language in the context of territorial and cultural disputes. The revision thus serves to reinforce Ukrainian identity and counteract Russian claims, making it a clear example of weaponization of cultural heritage through language.

Record 837 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Nikolaj1905" includes a significant focus on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) and its relationship with the Ukrainian government, particularly regarding the termination of its lease on historic sites. The language used in the diff, such as "the church had violated their lease by making alterations to the historic site," and the framing of the UOC-MP's response as "a whim of officials" suggests a narrative that could be interpreted as delegitimizing the church's claims and reinforcing the authority of the Ukrainian state over cultural heritage.

Additionally, the mention of Dmitry Peskov's statement that the Ukrainian authorities' decision "confirms the correctness" of the Russian invasion introduces a contentious political narrative that could be weaponized to frame the church's situation as part of a broader conflict. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the UOC-MP as an entity that is not only violating agreements but also as a pawn in a larger geopolitical struggle, thus potentially justifying actions taken against it.

The overall tone and context of the changes reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be used to justify state actions against a religious institution associated with Russian influence, which is a sensitive topic in the context of the ongoing conflict.

Analysis:
Record 538 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the spelling of "Kiev" to "Kyiv," which aligns with the Ukrainian government's official stance on the name of the city. This change is not merely a linguistic preference; it carries political implications, as "Kyiv" is often used to assert Ukrainian sovereignty and identity, especially in the context of ongoing tensions with Russia. The user making the edit appears to be reinforcing this perspective by adopting the Ukrainian spelling throughout the text, including in the context of the "Kyiv Pechersk Lavra," which is a culturally significant site.

Additionally, the removal of the reference to the "Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)" without a clear replacement could suggest an attempt to diminish the visibility of Russian influence in the narrative surrounding this heritage site. This aligns with the broader narrative of cultural oppression and the desire to assert Ukrainian heritage against perceived Russian encroachment.

Overall, the linguistic choices made in this revision serve to reinforce a specific national identity and political narrative, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

**Explanation:** The changes in the "Diff" field primarily involve a minor grammatical adjustment from "External link" to "External links" and the addition of external links related to the Kiev Pechersk Lavra and the Kyivan Cave Monastery. The comment by the user, "External links per MoS," indicates that the revision is aimed at adhering to the Manual of Style (MoS) for Wikipedia, which suggests a focus on formatting rather than content. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The links provided do not invoke any contentious terms or perspectives related to the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Thus, the revision does not exhibit any indicators of weaponization.

This led to the Ukrainian domination of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], which continued well into the 18th century, [[Feofan Prokopovich]] and [[Demetrius of Rostov]] being among the most notable representatives of this trend.\n \n-== Distinguishing between church bodies ==\n+== 20 th Century ==\n \n-Currently, the major Ukrainian Christian churches are: \n+After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the [[Russian Civil War]] the [[Bolshevik]] authorities initially tolerated and even encouraged Ukrainian nationalism following their victory in Ukraine. In [[1921]] a [[Sobor]] announced a new [[Autocephaly]], and created the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] (UAOC) in Kiev with [[Metropolitan Wasyl Lypkivskyj]] ordained as a  head of the UAOC.  In the wake of the break up of the [[Russian Empire]], Russian Orthodox church was seen as counterrevolutionary and pro-White by the Communists, and a [[Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church]] was  founded  with their encouragement in order to reduce the influence of patriarch [[Tikhon of Moscow]] whose position towards the revolution was strongly critical. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government later changed its religious policy and started to persecute UAOC along with the Russian Orthodox church. \n+\n+On [[October 8]], [[1942]] Archbishop Nikanor and Bishop Mstyslav (later a [[Patriarch]]) of the UAOC and Metropolitan Oleksiy (Hromadsky) of the Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church concluded an [[Act of Union]], uniting the two national churches at the [[Pochaev Lavra]]. Later [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation authorities and pro-Russian hierarchs of the Autonomous Church convinced Metropolitan Oleksiy to remove his signature. Metropolitan Oleksiy was murdered in [[Volhynia]] on [[May 7]], [[1943]] by the nationalist guerillas of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]].\n+\n+The Russian Orthodox Church regained its general monopoly in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] after [[World War II]] following another shift in the official Soviet attitude towards Christian churches. As a result many started to accuse it of being a [[puppet]] of the [[Communist Party]]. After the suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon, the UAOC and UGCC sought to avoid the transfer under the Moscow Patriarchy; something that Moscow tolerated until after World War II. At the state organized [[1948]] synod in [[Lviv]] (Lvov), some UGCC clergy were coerced into proclaiming the annulment of the [[1596]] [[Union of Brest]] thereby breaking the canonical ties with [[Catholic see|Rome]] and transferring under the Moscow Patriarchy. This move's acceptance was mixed. With many clergy members and lay believers turning to ROC, some adamantly refused. While the UAOC and UGCC church property in Ukraine was liquidated by the Soviet authorities or transferred to the ROC, many believers refused to accept liquidation of their churches and for nearly 40 years the UAOC and UGCC existed in Western Ukraine underground lead by the clergy members under the threat of prosecution by the Soviet state. Much of the UGCC and UAOC clergy not willing to serve in ROC emigrated to [[Germany]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]] and the Patriarchate of Moscow could legally lay claim to any Orthodox church property that was within the territory of its uncontested jurisdiction, which it did. \n+\n+The warm post-war attitude towards the Orthodox Church came to an end with [[Nikita Khruschev]]'s \"Thaw\" programme, which included closing the recently opened Kiev's Caves Lavra. However in the west-Ukrainian dioceses, which were the largest in the USSR, the Soviet attitude was \"softest\". In fact in the western city of Lviv, only one church was closed. The Moscow patriarchy also relaxed its canons on the clergy, especially those from the former-uniate territories, allowing them, for example to shave beards (a very uncommon Orthodox practice) and conduct liturgy in Ukrainian instead of Slavonic. \n+\n+In 1988 with the millennium anniversary of the baptism of Rus, there was yet another shift in the Soviet attitude towards religion, coinciding with the Perestroika and Glasnost programmes, the USSR apologized for all repressions towards religion and promised to return all property to the rightful owners. Although what began as a peaceful return of many closed church buildings (of course to the then ROC's Ukrainian Exarchate) in the central, eastern and southern Ukraine (as well as in other parts of the USSR), in the former-uniate regions of western Ukraine it was a different story. As UGCC survived in diaspora and in the underground they took their chance and were immediately revived in Ukraine, where in the wake of the Rukh movements the UOC-MP was viewed as a leftover of Soviet occupation, and bitter, often violent clashes over church buildings followed with the UOC-MP slowly losing its parishes to the UGCC. The UAOC also did not wait long and quickly followed suit. Sometimes possessors of Church buildings changes several times in the space of a couple of days. All Soviet attempts to pacify the almost-warring church parties were useless. It is now believed that the only real event which enabled to contain the schism in the former-uniate territory was the ROC's reaction of raising its Ukrainian Exarchate to the status of an autonomous church, which took place in 1990, and up until the break up of the USSR (late 1991) there was an uneasy peace in western Ukraine. However after the nation became independent, the question of an independent and autocephalous Orthodox Church arose once again and another schism was approaching.\n+\n+What historians now see as the reason for the following events was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine [[Filaret]] to achieve total [[autocephalocy]] (independence) from the Russian Orthodox Church. After the fall of the USSR he led a movement for «full canonical independence, namely, autocephaly» for his Church. In November 1991 he headed a working council which requested the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church to grant the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate autocephalous status. President of Ukraine (then, [[Leonid Kravchuk]]) supported Filaret's request but the Moscow Patriarchate strongly opposed it. Immediately a number of articles in the press accused Filaret of severe violation of his monastic vows and abuse of his ecclesiastical authority. The Hierarchical Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, that took place from March to April 1992, demanded that he resigns his position. Filaret, who attended the Council, promised that he would step down, but upon his return from Moscow, he disclosed that the promise was given under pressure and he is not leaving. Subsequently, in May 1992 at a Hierarchical Council held in [[Kharkhiv]] the majority of the bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate voted to depose Metropolitan Filaret from his office and suspend his clerical functioning. Despite, supported by three other bishops and political authorities in Ukraine, Filaret united with the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. In June of 1992 they created a new Church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kievan Patriarchate (UOC-KP) with 94-year-old [[Patriarch Mstyslav]] as a leader. Though only chosen as assistant, Filaret was in fact controlling the Church affairs. Opposing this situation, some of the Autocephalous [[bishop]]s and clergy refused to join the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate.\n+\n+==Modern Times==\n \n * The [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchy|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] (UOC-MP) under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (ROC). Since 1990 the UOC-MP operates as an [[autonomy|autonomous]] church (one step short of full [[autocephaly]]). The [[Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan)]] is enthroned since [[1992]] as the head of the UOC-MP under the title [[Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine]].\n \n@@ -46,19 +58,9 @@\n \n The current divided and fluid situation traces its roots to the close connection between Orthodox church and the state in [[Tsarist Russia]] after the transfer of the Kiev Metropolitan [[Episcopal see|see]] from the Patriarch of Constantinople to the Patriarch of Moscow in [[1686]].  Some clerics and church historians, particularly in Ukraine, do not consider this transfer legitimate and claim it was attempted via the ecclesiastic crime of [[bribery]] by the Russian Church, then only recently elevated to patriarchal status, but eventually accepted under pressure from the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[Sultan]]. This development, they claim, resulted in a forced policy of [[Russification]] of Ukrainian Christianity. Gradually Russophile Orthodox clergy during the 18th and 19th centuries became dominant in Ukraine. Despite the fact that the transfer was and still is occasionally questioned in Ukraine, it gained a de-facto recognition and acceptance in the Eastern Orthodox communion by 300+ years of Ukrainian Orthodoxy remaining in the see of the Patriarch of Moscow.\n \n-After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the [[Russian Civil War]] the [[Bolshevik]] authorities initially tolerated and even encouraged Ukrainian nationalism following their victory in Ukraine. In [[1921]] a [[Sobor]] announced a new [[Autocephaly]], and created the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] (UAOC) in Kiev with [[Metropolitan Wasyl Lypkivskyj]] ordained as a  head of the UAOC.  In the wake of the break up of the [[Russian Empire]], Russian Orthodox church was seen as counterrevolutionary and pro-White by the Communists, and a [[Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church]] was  founded  with their encouragement in order to reduce the influence of patriarch [[Tikhon of Moscow]] whose position towards the revolution was strongly critical. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government later changed its religious policy and started to persecute UAOC along with the Russian Orthodox church. \n \n-On [[October 8]], [[1942]] Archbishop Nikanor and Bishop Mstyslav (later a Patriarch) of the UAOC and Metropolitan Oleksiy (Hromadsky) of the Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church concluded an [[Act of Union]], uniting the two national churches at the [[Pochaev Lavra]]. Later [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation authorities and pro-Russian hierarchs of the Autonomous Church convinced Metropolitan Oleksiy to remove his signature. Metropolitan Oleksiy was murdered in [[Volhynia]] on [[May 7]], [[1943]] by the nationalist guerillas of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]].\n \n-The Russian Orthodox Church regained its general monopoly in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] after [[World War II]] following another shift in the official Soviet attitude towards Christian churches. As a result many started to accuse it of being a [[puppet]] of the [[Communist Party]]. After the suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon, the UAOC and UGCC sought to avoid the transfer under the Moscow Patriarchy; something that Moscow tolerated until after World War II. At the state organized [[1948]] synod in [[Lviv]] (Lvov), some UGCC clergy were coerced into proclaiming the annulment of the [[1596]] [[Union of Brest]] thereby breaking the canonical ties with [[Catholic see|Rome]] and transferring under the Moscow Patriarchy. This move's acceptance was mixed. With many clergy members and lay believers turning to ROC, some adamantly refused. While the UAOC and UGCC church property in Ukraine was liquidated by the Soviet authorities or transferred to the ROC, many believers refused to accept liquidation of their churches and for nearly 40 years the UAOC and UGCC existed in Western Ukraine underground lead by the clergy members under the threat of prosecution by the Soviet state. Much of the UGCC and UAOC clergy not willing to serve in ROC emigrated to [[Germany]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]] and the Patriarchate of Moscow could legally lay claim to any Orthodox church property that was within the territory of its uncontested jurisdiction, which it did. \n-\n-The warm post-war attitude towards the Orthodox Church came to an end with Nikita Khruschev's \"Thaw\" programme, which included closing the recently opened Kiev's Caves Lavra. However in the west-Ukrainian dioceses, which were the largest in the USSR, the Soviet attitude was \"softest\". In fact in the western city of Lvov, only one church was closed. The Moscow patriarchy also relaxed its canons on the clergy, especially those from the former-uniate territories, allowing them, for example to shave beards (a very uncommon Orthodox practice) and conduct liturgy in Ukrainian instead of Slavonic. \n-\n-In 1988 with the millennium anniversary of the baptism of Rus, there was yet another shift in the Soviet attitude towards religion, coinciding with the Perestroika and Glasnost programmes, the USSR apologized for all repressions towards religion and promised to return all property to the rightful owners. Although what began as a peaceful return of many closed church buildings (of course to the then ROC's Ukrainian Exarchate) in the central, eastern and southern Ukraine (as well as in other parts of the USSR), in the former-uniate regions of western Ukraine it was a different story. As UGCC survived in diaspora and in the underground they took their chance and were immediately revived in Ukraine, where in the wake of the Rukh movements the UOC-MP was viewed as a leftover of Soviet occupation, and bitter, often violent clashes over church buildings followed with the UOC-MP slowly losing its parishes to the UGCC. The UAOC also did not wait long and quickly followed suit. Sometimes possessors of Church buildings changes several times in the space of a couple of days. All Soviet attempts to pacify the almost-warring church parties were unsuccessful, especially after the UGCC's demand that all property that was held prior to 1939 would be returned (even though some it was Orthodox before the Unia came). It is now believed that the only real event which enabled to contain the schism in the former-uniate territory was the ROC's reaction of raising its Ukrainian Exarchate to the status of an autonomous church, which took place in 1990, and up until the break up of the USSR (late 1991) there was an uneasy peace in western Ukraine. However after the nation became independent, the question of an independent and autocephalous Orthodox Church arose once again and another schism was approaching.\n-\n-What historians now see as the reason for the following events was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine Filaret to achieve total autocephalocy from the Russian Orthodox Church. To achieve that, with active support of the then president Leonid Kravchuk, he covertely organised a communion with the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in case Moscow refused. The skeptical hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church called for a full council where this issue would have been discussed, upon arrival most of the clergy of the UOC who initially supported Filaret, openely criticised this move and immediately the votes turned against him. In the end the council voted for Filaret to retire from his position which was confirmed by a swore. Upon returning to Kiev however Filaret carried out his reserve option, and Police aided by nationalist Paramilitaries supported him in retaining his rank. The UOC synod was quick to respond and in the eastern city of Kharkov elected a new leader, the Metropolitan Vladimir (Slobodan). From there most of the fate of control of church buildings was decided by the church parishes, but when most refused to follow Filaret, paramilitaries, especially in Volyn and Rovno Oblasts carried out raids bringing property under their control.\n-\n-The UOC-MP, which operates in [[full communion|communion]] with the other Eastern Orthodox Churches still owns the majority of Orthodox church buildings in Ukraine and is predominant in eastern and southern Ukraine. The UGCC and the UAOC, on the other hand, have most of their communities in the western provinces ([[oblast]]s} of [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]],  [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] and [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Ivano-Frankivsk]].

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Ukrained" reflects a clear attempt to shift the narrative surrounding the historical context of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church. The comment "rv continuous POV-pushing by the Russian Group" indicates a defensive stance against perceived bias, suggesting that the user is actively trying to counter what they view as a Russian-centric perspective.

Several linguistic indicators in the "Diff" section highlight this weaponization:

1. **Terminology and Framing**: The use of terms like "Ukrainian domination of the Russian Orthodox Church" and "forced policy of Russification" frames the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes Ukrainian agency and victimization, while delegitimizing Russian claims. This aligns with the Ukrainian perspective of cultural heritage being under threat from Russian influence.

2. **Historical Context**: The revision includes detailed accounts of the persecution of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) and the manipulation of church properties, which serve to reinforce a narrative of oppression and resistance against Russian control. Phrases like "many believers refused to accept liquidation of their churches" evoke a sense of cultural resilience against an oppressive regime.

3. **Conflict and Violence**: The mention of "nationalist guerillas of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army" and the violent clashes over church buildings introduces a narrative of conflict that positions Ukrainian nationalists as defenders of their cultural heritage against external threats, further polar

Record 146 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a narrative that subtly shifts the focus towards a dichotomy between urban and rural populations in Ukraine, framing the UOC-MP (Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate) as a representation of traditional and conservative values in rural areas, while portraying urban society as influenced by "Marxist, cosmopolitan ideals." This language can be interpreted as an attempt to create a cultural divide, suggesting that urban populations are disconnected from traditional values, which may serve to delegitimize their perspectives.

Additionally, the mention of "ex-Communists" and the comparison to Soviet times implies a continuity of ideological control, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the UOC-MP as a legitimate cultural institution in contrast to perceived urban liberalism. The reference to "Russophilism/Moscowphilism" further emphasizes a narrative that positions the UOC-MP as a bastion of traditional Ukrainian identity against a backdrop of urban cosmopolitanism.

The dismissal of U.S. government data with a comparison to the Iraq War narrative ("Saddam had WMO that are still to be found") suggests a broader skepticism towards Western narratives, which can be weaponized to foster distrust in external influences and reinforce a pro-Russian stance. Overall, the language used in this revision reflects a strategic framing of cultural identity that aligns with specific political narratives, thus qualifying it as weaponised.

Analysis:
Record 735 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the language surrounding the jurisdiction of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra. The phrase "extrajudicially transferred" implies a controversial and possibly illegitimate action, which can frame the transfer of authority to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in a negative light. This choice of words suggests that the transfer was not sanctioned by legal means, thereby casting doubt on the legitimacy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's claim to the site.

Additionally, the context of the revision, which occurs in a politically charged environment, can be interpreted as an attempt to influence perceptions regarding the control of cultural heritage sites. The use of "extrajudicially" aligns with narratives that may seek to portray the actions of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church as overreaching or unlawful, which can be weaponized in the broader discourse about cultural and territorial control in the context of the ongoing conflict.

Overall, the linguistic indicators—specifically the term "extrajudicially"—suggest a deliberate framing that could be used to justify opposition to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's authority and to reinforce narratives of conflict over cultural heritage.

Analysis:
Record 28 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The text in the "Diff" field primarily discusses scientific concepts related to electromotive force, black matter radiation, and the potential for new superconductive materials. The mention of "Ukrainian people" is framed positively, highlighting their intelligence and expressing a desire for them to notice the author's understanding. This does not invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage; rather, it appears to be an attempt to engage with a specific audience (Ukrainians) in a scientific context.

There are no indicators of cultural oppression, territorial claims, or narratives that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage. The language is technical and focused on scientific discourse rather than political or cultural conflict. The overall tone is one of hope and collaboration rather than division or conflict.

Analysis:
Record 264 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces derogatory language and a pejorative characterization of Ukrainian culture by referring to Ukrainians as "the biggest homosexuals" and using the phrase "witch like male genetals." This shift in tone is not only disrespectful but also serves to undermine the cultural identity of Ukrainians by framing it in a negative light. Such language can be weaponized to promote stereotypes, incite division, and delegitimize Ukrainian cultural heritage. The absence of a constructive comment from the user further suggests an intent to provoke rather than to contribute positively to the discourse.

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Agricolae" involves a change in the description of the diocese associated with a cultural site, specifically altering the phrasing from "De jure: Ukrainian Orthodox Church, De facto: Moscow Patriarchate" to simply "Ukrainian Orthodox Church." This change appears to simplify the representation of the church's affiliation without introducing any charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment indicates that the change is disputed and suggests a need for discussion on the Talk page, which reflects a collaborative editing process rather than an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives. There are no indicators of the specific weaponization terms or narratives associated with either perspective in the provided text.

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Florificapis" involves the addition of a category label, specifically "Eastern Orthodox pilgrimage sites," to the article. The comment indicates that this change is administrative in nature, aimed at organizing content rather than altering the narrative or tone of the article. There are no linguistic indicators or terms present in the "Diff" or "Comment" that suggest a shift towards weaponizing cultural heritage. The addition of a category related to Eastern Orthodox pilgrimage sites does not imply any political or cultural conflict; rather, it appears to be a straightforward categorization effort. Thus, the content remains neutral and does not reflect any weaponization of cultural heritage.

}

Analysis:
Record 87 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision comment and the diff indicate a contentious discussion surrounding the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, specifically the rivalry between the Kiev Patriarchy (UOC-KP) and the Moscow Patriarchy (UOC-MP). The user expresses a concern about bias in the representation of Patriarch Filaret, which suggests a sensitivity to how cultural and religious narratives are framed. 

The phrase "the current version of 'modern time' subsection describes the situation about right" implies a subjective interpretation of what is considered accurate or fair representation, which can be indicative of an attempt to assert a particular narrative over another. The mention of "trolls" and the threat to file a Request for Comment (RfC) if certain text is reinstated suggests a combative stance towards opposing views, which can escalate tensions around cultural heritage narratives.

Additionally, the context of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church is deeply intertwined with national identity and cultural heritage, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The language used here reflects an underlying struggle for narrative control, which is a hallmark of weaponization in cultural discourse. The focus on bias and the need for a neutral point of view (NPOV) further emphasizes the potential for manipulation of cultural narratives to serve specific agendas.

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "StarkReport" primarily incorporates references to the recognition of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) by Patriarch Gregory VII. The language used in the "Diff" does not exhibit any overtly weaponized terms or narratives that align with the examples provided for either Ukraine's or Russia's perspectives. 

The content remains focused on historical events and the ecclesiastical context without invoking charged language or framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage for political ends. The mention of the "Soviet regime" and the "Russian Orthodox Church" is factual and does not carry the weight of propaganda or a narrative that seeks to justify actions or shift perceptions in a contentious manner. 

Overall, the changes appear to enhance the historical accuracy of the article rather than weaponize cultural heritage.

Record 155 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes specific language that frames the historical context of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra in a way that aligns with a narrative of cultural oppression. The phrases "left uncovered during the Soviet occupation" and "the regime's disregard for religion" suggest a negative portrayal of the Soviet era, implying a deliberate act of disrespect towards Orthodox saints and their relics. This language evokes a sense of victimization and cultural loss, which can be used to justify contemporary sentiments against the Soviet legacy and reinforce a Ukrainian national identity.

Additionally, the mention of the "fall of the Soviet Union" and the subsequent covering of the bodies with cloth serves to highlight a restoration of cultural and religious respect, contrasting the past oppression with a present that values and protects cultural heritage. This shift in tone and emphasis on historical grievances can be seen as a way to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a manner that promotes a specific political agenda and fosters division.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Bandurist" includes a factual addition regarding the support of the UOC-MP (Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchate) based on a sociological study. The added sentence states that the UOC-MP has the support of 5 million parishioners and 8% support in Kiev. 

This addition does not employ any weaponized language or narratives that could be interpreted as framing cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The tone remains neutral and factual, focusing on statistical data rather than invoking any charged terms or implications related to cultural oppression, territorial claims, or identity conflicts. 

The context provided by the comment "/* Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchate */" does not suggest any intent to manipulate or weaponize the cultural narrative surrounding the church. Instead, it appears to be a straightforward update to the article's content. Thus, the revision does not exhibit the linguistic indicators associated with weaponization.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The user "Irpen" introduces the term "Muscovite Russia" and emphasizes the distinction between "Muscovy" and "Russia," framing the latter as a "self-appellation" that has historical legitimacy. This choice of terminology can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the historical narrative associated with "Muscovy," which is a term that may carry negative connotations in certain contexts, particularly in discussions surrounding Russian identity and heritage.

Furthermore, the phrase "the idea that Muscovy isn't Russia and it later 'stole' the name is an old Russophobic tale" explicitly labels opposing views as "Russophobic," which is a charged term that can be used to dismiss criticism and frame the discussion in a defensive manner. This framing can serve to polarize the narrative, suggesting that any questioning of the historical continuity between Muscovy and modern Russia is rooted in bias rather than legitimate historical inquiry.

Overall, the revision reflects a shift in tone that seeks to assert a specific cultural narrative while discrediting alternative perspectives, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization identified in the provided examples.

This transfer was resisted at first at Constantinople, since it was attempted via the ecclesiastic crime of [[bribery]] by the Russian Church, only recently elevated to patriatrchal status, but then accepted under pressure from the [[Turkish]] [[Sultan]].  A policy of ecclesiastic forced [[Russification]] began for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.  Ukrainian bishops were slated to serve only in the foreign land of Russia, and vice-versa.

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily involves changes in the spelling of "Kyiv" from "Kiev" and minor grammatical adjustments. The user comment indicates a focus on standardizing English usage rather than altering the content's meaning or tone. There are no shifts in narrative that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage, such as framing the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in a contentious light or invoking terms that could be used to justify political or territorial claims. The changes appear to be editorial in nature, aimed at consistency rather than promoting a specific ideological agenda.

The Soviet régime initially supported it, then in the early 1930s destroyed its hierarchy, which it forced into exile. The Church re-established itself in Ukraine during the Nazi occupation in World War II, and was again driven underground after the War. The church re-gained official recognition in the late 1980s, and was initially administered from abroad by [[Patriarch Mstyslav]]. Following his death in 1993 it was re-organised into an independent church, after a brief union with the UOC-KP. Since then the church has been more successful in dialogue with the UOC(MP).<ref>Interview with Archbishop Ioan (Modzalevsky), [http://orthodoxy.org.ua/uk/mejkonfessionalnyy_dialog/2007/03/13/6390.html «Я - відвертий та давній прихильник порозуміння між УАПЦ та УПЦ».]</ref>\n-\n-{{As of | 2013}} the church has 1015 parishes and 697 churches. Geographically the church operates almost exclusively in the western areas of Ukraine, with minute support elsewhere. The UAOC formerly included many parishes in the Ukrainian diaspora communities in Canada and in the United States. These have, however, formed two separate churches: the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada]] (established in 1990<ref>\n-http://www.uocc.ca/en-ca/about/history/\n-</ref>) and the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA]]. In 1995 the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] accepted the latter churches under his patronage, citing the transfer controversy of the Kiev Metropolitan's see to the Moscow Patriarchate in 1686 and, thus, fulfilling a necessary step for the achievement of the canonical standing by these diaspora Churches (still not universally recognised). While this move, as well as the cited reason, soured relations between the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]] and the ROC (which refused to recognise it), the standing of the diaspora churches does not affect the status of the UAOC itself.\n \n ====Old Believers====\n Traditionally the Ukrainian clergy, following the annexation of Kievan Metropolia, were one of the main sources of opposition to the [[Old Believer]] schism which took place at the time, under [[Patriarch Nikon]]. None of the Ukrainian parishes followed the [[Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church]]. Although in 1905 the Tsar's decree on freedom of religion allowed the Old Believers church to reform, it gained little support in Ukraine. Presently, however the Old Believer community very much exploited the politicised schism in Ukrainian Orthodoxy and, as of 2004, number 53 communities scattered throughout Ukraine, with one of the biggest in [[Vylkove]].<ref>[http://www.starovery.ru/pravda/nzd.php?cid=81 На злобу дня<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>"

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the representation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, particularly with the introduction of the "Orthodox Church of Ukraine" (OCU) and the removal of references to the "Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate" (UOC-KP). This change is indicative of a broader narrative surrounding the legitimacy and recognition of religious institutions in Ukraine, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict with Russia.

1. **Terminology Shift**: The term "Orthodox Church of Ukraine" is presented as a newly established entity that received a "tomos of autocephaly," which emphasizes its independence and legitimacy. This contrasts with the previous mention of the UOC-KP as "canonically unrecognised," which could be interpreted as delegitimizing the church's status.

2. **Contextual Implications**: The revision highlights the unification of various Ukrainian Orthodox jurisdictions under the OCU, framing it as a nationalistic move towards a "Ukrainian National Orthodox Church." This aligns with narratives that promote Ukrainian sovereignty and cultural identity against perceived Russian influence.

3. **Cultural Heritage Weaponization**: The removal of historical context regarding the UOC-KP's struggles and its previous leadership under Patriarch Filaret may serve to erase a part of the cultural heritage narrative that could be used to argue for the church's historical significance and legitimacy. Instead, the focus is shifted towards the

**Explanation:**
The changes made in the "Diff" section primarily involve the addition of a specific individual, Oleksander Turchinov, to the context of Protestantism in Ukraine. The mention of Turchinov, particularly his role as a pastor and his position as head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), could be seen as an attempt to highlight the intersection of religion and politics. However, the language used does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. 

The overall tone remains neutral, focusing on the demographic and historical aspects of Protestantism in Ukraine without framing it in a way that could be construed as promoting a particular political agenda or narrative. The revision does not include any language that suggests cultural oppression, territorial claims, or any other indicators of weaponization. Instead, it provides factual information about religious groups in Ukraine, which does not align with the examples of weaponized language provided.

Separate discussions about the usage of the name in text of other articles took place at different talk pages. Maybe we could create an article entitled [[Spellings of the Name of the Capital of Ukraine]]. The article will be devoted to how the city name was written, particulary in English, and why. It could also say about introduction of Kyiv spelling and how well (or badly) it succeeds. Its talk page ([[Talk:Spellings of the Name of the Capital of Ukraine]]) would releive all other talk pages from this topic and, possibly, allow to reach some conclusion. We do need a conclusion. Opinions of the editors are strong and different and the WP needs consistency. Below is the discussion which was here before I wrote this note. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 05:17, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC))\n-\n-Changed Kyiv -> Kiev (arguments discussed all too often)and external web-links moved to the end of the article. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 20:25, Apr 16, 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-: Irpen, you're unfairly glossing over the issue.  The titling of the article on \"[[Kiev]]\" has been discussed and resolved, because the Russian transliteration is the most commonly used name in English.   \n-\n-: But regarding the use of the city's native Ukrainian name ''Kyiv'' in writing there is no consensus, no Wikipedia policy nor convention, and very little actual discussion.  ''Kyiv'' is used in several English-language publications and press establishments.  It is an alternate name in English, the authors of this article have deemed it acceptable in its context, and no random readers have changed it or complained.  It can be just as legitimately used as the name in Russian \"Kharkov\" is for [[Kharkiv]], in articles about WWII battles in the Ukrainian SSR.\n-\n-::I agree there is no consensus. There was similarly no \"consensus\" for the titling of the [[Kiev]] article. Just the reasoning for Kiev appeared strong enough even for those who disagreed. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]]\n-\n-: You've stated elsewhere that ''\"I see the usage of Kyiv by many authors as a completely legitimate attempt to change the established name of the city\"''.  I'm tempted to see your systematic censorship as an attempt to protect the status quo.  I respect you for your contributions and your infinitely patient discussions, but you seem to be just as attached to the question of Kyiv vs. Kiev as I am.  \n-\n-::  I did not mean the editors of WP are among the authors whose use of Kyiv I find acceptable. It is OK to use Kyiv, say, as a journalist, if this does not contradict the style policy of the newspaper or a magazine. It is also OK to use Kyiv for the book authors if they see fit. These two cases are examples of acceptable promoting the usage of Kyiv. It is not OK to use Kyiv (at least yet) in encyclopedia, which, as a ''reference'' source, should reflect the established usage rather than be used to push one term over another. I am trying to make sure that WP reflects the current usage as it should. If you consider this as \"protecting the status quo\" I won't argue about that. Encyclopedia is a wrong medium to push one term, preferable to some, against the other. There are other media, including many on the web, appropriate for this. Whatever usage currently prevails, it is the one encyclopedia should use. When KharkIv seemed to have been established and beat KharkOv in modern English usage, it became an appropriate term for the WP and I voted for it. KharkOv is still established in some fields, therefore it is appropriate to use in certain topics. KYIV is not established in any context since Kiev was used in English for as long as there are any records. Currently, because of the partial success of promoters KYIV, it became somewhat used. It warrants a mention and discussion on the naming in the text of a [[Kiev]] article as well as a mention in parentheses in some other articles. It's very limited usage in the major English media shows that it should not be used as a main name for the city in encyclopedia. That's my view on the issue.\n-\n-:: Therefore, while I never go to editing the article just to replace Kyiv by Kiev, I do that when I edit the page for other reasons. This page, for instance, was in a dire need of an expansion template and links were placed at the wrong place. This prompted my interference, not the usage of Kyiv itself. I would have never been persistent, if I haven't viewed Kyiv as a wrong usage in an encyclopedia article. I supported changing terms to Ukrainian names in many cases. Thanks for your complements :). I will not revert Kyiv in this article now but only for the sake of the world peace. I might do it later if I research the subject of the hisory of Ukrainian christianity enough to contribute to this article. I am open, though, to opinions on the issue at this and other talk pages. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]]\n-\n-: I am choosing to combat systemic bias, and restoring the use of ''Kyiv'' in this article.  ''&mdash;[[User:Mzajac |Michael]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mzajac |Z.]]&nbsp;<small>2005-04-16&nbsp;22:04&nbsp;Z</small>''\n-\n-:: I think it is incorrect to call my position a systemic bias. I do view the usage of Kyiv in encyclopedia as premature and act accordingly. However, it is easy to see that I endorsed and used other Ukrainian names in many articles. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 16:43, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-::: No offense meant.  By ''systemic bias'' I just meant the inertia of a mainstream convention.  It's not necessarily a wrong bias, and 'combating' it certainly is by definition \"experimental\", but Wikipedia does have some commitment to that end (i.e., [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias]]). \n-:::: No offence taken :). I can't argue that widely accepted conventions may create the bias toward the mainstream opinion. Means of addressing this problem is a different issue. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]]\n-\n-::: I apologize for accusing you of \"systematic censorship\"; that was definitely out of line.  You certainly are one of the most objective editors regarding such matters.  ''&mdash;[[User:Mzajac |Michael]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mzajac |Z.]]&nbsp;<small>2005-04-18&nbsp;20:54&nbsp;Z</small>''\n-:::: I didn't take it as any offence at all. I agree that the editors should exercise a reasonable self-restraint in changing the names even when they feel there are good reasons for doing so. My self-imposed restraint in the cases like this is not to push the \"edit\" button for the sole purpose of changing the name of a person or a place. However, I do change names (in good faith) in the course of other edits in the article. Unlike Kharkiv/Kharkov, I just don't feel that there exists a context that might affect the choice between Kyiv/Kiev as a primary name since Kiev seems to have always been and still seems to be a primary usage in English. Of course which term is correct may be a subject of debate. But whatever the correct term is, it should be used in WP for the sake of consistency. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]]\n-\n-==Suggestion to move the article from the ''\"Ukrainian Orthodox Church\"'' to ''\"Orthodox Christianity in Ukraine\"''==\n-Such title would seem more appropriate since two churches currently claim the jurisdiction and the name and the article is broader than simply being about these two churches. This is the article about the history of Ukrainian Christianity which in any case won't be a history of any of these churches, both created very recently. If after some years, the situation settles down and there will be a single canonical universally recognized church body in UA under the UOC name, we could change the name back. Currently there is no article titled  \"[[Orthodox Christianity in Ukraine]]\" and the current article may be moved to a new name without any difficulty and without submissions to the \"requested moves\" page. If there are objections or alternative names, please list them here.\n-\n-I would like to request from those who disagree not to sabotage the name change proposal by creating [[Orthodox Christianity in Ukraine]] entry with a redirect to this article. There is no need to complicate the proposed move in such a bad faith way. If I see reasonable objections, I will not do anything until they are discussed. - [[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 20:14, Apr 18, 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-: That sounds reasonable; histories of the individual churches could grow into their own articles in addition to this one, but they are somewhat intertwined so perhaps not.  There would have to be a bit more representation of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] (inclusion of which may be controversial), but not much because that one has a larger article of its own.  ''&mdash;[[User:Mzajac |Michael]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mzajac |Z.]]&nbsp;<small>2005-04-18&nbsp;20:38&nbsp;Z</small>''\n-\n-: Come to think of it, there's some historical material at UGCC which might be merged into this article.  To be done with sensitivity for other editors, I think.  ''&mdash;[[User:Mzajac |Michael]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mzajac |Z.]]&nbsp;<small>2005-04-18&nbsp;20:41&nbsp;Z</small>''\n-\n-:: I think UGCC  definitely needs to get discussed in this article. The history of its coming into being, periods of rivalry (with involvement of different political authorities), periods of suppression and (relatively) peaceful coexistence with the Orthodox churches is a part of the history of the Orthodox Christianity in Ukraine. Same applies to a RC church. Personally, I would welcome such contribution. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 00:54, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-==Page moved to even broader title ''\"History of Christianity in Ukraine\"''.==\n-After some thought, I figured it is impossible to write a separate history of Orthodox Christianity of Ukraine. So, I moved this article (there were no objections) to the \"History of Christianity in Ukraine\". The histories of all Ukrainian Churches are so intertwined with each other and with UGCC that it is impossible to write a separate history of Ukrainian Orthodoxy. Please contibute to improving this article! I will keep working on it these days but not sure how much time I will have. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 23:34, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-Thinking more of it. I really think it is impossible to have separate articles about each major church in UA, except, UGCC, which has a centuries long history. The history of all orthodox churches in UA are so intertwined that it is impossible to tell the story of one church without invoking the other all the time. I posted a <nowiki>{{merge}}</nowiki> template at both UOC-KP and UOC-MP articles. My suggestion is to merge all the info about these churches into the [[History of Christianity in Ukraine]] article when their stories, which are mostly stories of their relationship, may be told fully. Perhaps, the UAOC having its own history due to its life in diaspora when it was suppress in UA, may still have an article on its own in addition to being covered here.

Analysis:
Record 47 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant shift in the discussion surrounding the naming of Kyiv versus Kiev, which is emblematic of broader cultural and political tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The comment "Nationalist bias has no place in an encyclopedia" suggests an attempt to frame the use of "Kyiv" as a politically charged term, while simultaneously dismissing the historical context of the name "Kiev" as a reflection of Russian influence. 

The phrase "Russian occupation" and "foreign land of Russia" being labeled as inappropriate indicates a deliberate effort to sanitize the language surrounding the conflict, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Ukrainian claims to sovereignty and cultural identity. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to control the narrative around the historical and cultural significance of names and places, which are deeply tied to national identity.

Furthermore, the editor's insistence on "neutral and factual based" writing while dismissing terms that reflect Ukrainian perspectives can be interpreted as an effort to impose a specific narrative that favors Russian historical claims. This manipulation of language and terminology is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization, aiming to reshape public perception and historical understanding in a way that serves particular political agendas.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the diocese affiliation from the "Orthodox Church of Ukraine" to a more explicit mention of the "Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)" as the previous affiliation until 2022. This shift in language is significant as it reflects a narrative that emphasizes the transition of religious authority in the context of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The use of "Orthodox Church of Ukraine" aligns with a Ukrainian national identity, while the reference to the "Moscow Patriarchate" invokes the Russian influence and historical ties, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the cultural and religious landscape in a way that supports the narrative of Ukrainian sovereignty and the rejection of Russian dominance. The explicit mention of the timeline ("since 2022") further underscores the recent changes in cultural and religious affiliations, which can be weaponized to assert claims of cultural oppression or liberation.

}

Analysis:
Record 483 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several linguistic indicators that suggest a potential weaponization of cultural heritage. 

1. **Contextual Emphasis on Shared Culture**: The phrase "Ukraine has a shared culture with neighboring nations" is a neutral statement, but the addition of "In addition, the culture of [[Ukrainian Cossacks]] (dress, weapons, etc.) has significant traces of the cultures of [[Turkic peoples]]" shifts the focus towards a specific cultural lineage that may be used to assert a distinct Ukrainian identity in contrast to Russian heritage. This can be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize Ukrainian uniqueness in the face of historical narratives that may conflate Ukrainian and Russian identities.

2. **Historical Reference to the Soviet Era**: The mention of "The 70 years of the [[Soviet era]] left their traces, often devastating, in the cultural history of the country and the people" introduces a negative connotation associated with the Soviet period. This framing can be seen as a way to invoke a narrative of victimhood and cultural oppression, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by highlighting historical grievances.

3. **Cultural Symbols and Political Statements**: The reference to the phrase "Razom nas bahato, nas ne podolaty" (Together we are many! We cannot be defeated!) serves as a rallying cry that reinforces a sense of unity and resistance among Ukrainians. This can be interpreted as

**Explanation:**
The revision comment and the diff text indicate a contentious discussion surrounding copyright and the integrity of content on Wikipedia. The user "Kuban Cossack" expresses frustration over perceived administrative overreach and the imposition of semi-protection on the article, which they argue restricts contributions from users who do not have accounts. This reflects a narrative of exclusion and control, which can be weaponized to frame the administrative actions as oppressive or unjust.

Specific linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase "juggling with recently obtained administrative power" suggests a negative view of authority and implies misuse of power.
- The term "sock puppet issue" is used to question the legitimacy of the administrative actions without providing evidence, which can undermine trust in the editorial process.
- The expression of being "discouraged" and the mention of "less free time" evoke a sense of personal grievance and victimization, which can be leveraged to rally support against perceived injustices.

Overall, the language used in this revision reflects a shift towards framing the administrative actions as oppressive, which can be seen as a weaponization of the cultural heritage of collaborative knowledge creation on platforms like Wikipedia.

Analysis:
Record 72 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. Specifically, the change in the description of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) includes a reference to the "Bolshevik Revolution" and the context of "Communists tolerating and at times even encouraging Ukrainian nationalism in the 1920s." This phrasing can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical relationship between Ukrainian nationalism and Soviet authority in a way that may evoke a sense of legitimacy or victimhood regarding Ukrainian cultural identity.

Additionally, the original text's mention of "Soviet government suppression" is retained, but the added context in the revision shifts the focus to a more complex narrative that could be used to justify contemporary claims of cultural oppression or to frame the historical struggle for Ukrainian identity in a light that aligns with current political narratives. The use of terms like "survived in the diaspora" and the emphasis on the church's re-establishment post-Soviet Union further highlight the resilience of Ukrainian cultural heritage against perceived oppression, which can be leveraged in contemporary discussions about cultural sovereignty and identity.

Overall, the revision's language choices reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be utilized to support current political narratives, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.

Record 481 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the description of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, particularly in the phrase "the monastery is once again active, with over 100 monks in residence." This addition emphasizes the current operational status of the monastery, which could be interpreted as a reinforcement of its cultural and religious significance amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions. 

Moreover, the mention of the "Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)" in the context of jurisdiction over the site suggests a framing that could be used to highlight divisions within the Orthodox community, potentially weaponizing the narrative around cultural heritage by implying a conflict over religious and cultural identity. 

The overall tone remains neutral, but the specific details included in the revision could be leveraged to support narratives of cultural preservation and religious legitimacy, which are often central to the discourse surrounding the conflict in Ukraine. The lack of a comment from the user also leaves the intent behind the revision ambiguous, which can further contribute to the potential for weaponization.

However, it was the [[East Slavs]] who came to dominate the territory of present-day Ukraine, beginning with the rule of the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']], whose [[Slavic_mythology#Pantheon|pantheon of gods]] had held a considerable following for over 600 years. \n-Following the [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|assault on Constantinople]] by Rus' forces under the command of [[Askold and Dir]], the two princes were baptized in that holy city. Returning to Kyiv, the two actively championed Christianity for a period of 20 years, until they were murdered by the [[pagan]] [[Oleg of Novgorod|Prince Oleh]] (Oleg). [[Ecumenical Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photios]] purportedly provided a bishop and priests from [[Constantinople]] to help in the [[christianization]] of the Slavs.<ref>Chirovsky, Nicholas (1981).

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user "Irpen" involves the addition of the "Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church" to the list of churches referenced in the article. This change does not introduce any language or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on the historical and religious context of Christianity in Ukraine without invoking any politically charged narratives or framing that could suggest a conflict or cultural oppression. The tone is neutral, and the addition of the church name appears to be an effort to provide a more comprehensive view of the religious landscape in Ukraine rather than to promote a specific ideological agenda.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Mzajac" involves a subtle but significant change in the translation of the phrase "Together we are many! We can be defeated!" to "Together we are many! We can’t be defeated!" This shift from a statement of vulnerability ("can be defeated") to one of resilience and strength ("can’t be defeated") alters the tone and implications of the phrase. 

This change can be interpreted as a reinforcement of a defiant narrative, which is often weaponized in cultural contexts to promote unity and resistance against perceived oppression or threats. The original phrase could imply a call for solidarity in the face of adversity, while the revised version emphasizes an unyielding spirit, which can serve to galvanize support and foster a sense of invincibility among Ukrainians. 

Such linguistic shifts can be strategically used to frame cultural identity and heritage in a way that aligns with nationalistic sentiments, particularly in the context of ongoing conflicts. The context of the comment, which indicates a translation, further suggests an intention to present a more empowering narrative, potentially weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the phrase.

**Explanation:** The "Diff" field contains a statement that reflects a clear bias against Ukrainian perspectives, specifically in the phrase "nationalist Ukrainian lunatics" and "disgusting fringe POVs." These terms are derogatory and serve to delegitimize Ukrainian cultural narratives, framing them as extreme or irrational. This language can be seen as an attempt to undermine the validity of Ukrainian cultural heritage and perspectives, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing one side's views as unacceptable or fringe. The overall tone of the comment suggests an effort to dismiss and marginalize Ukrainian cultural identity in favor of a more dominant narrative.

However after the nation became independent, the question of an independent and autocephalous Orthodox Church arose once again and another schism was approaching.\n \n ===Post-independence===\n-What historians now see as the reason for the following events was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine Filaret to achieve total autocephalocy of his [[metropolitan see]] with or without the approval of the [[motherchurch]] required by the [[canon law]]. These events followed Filaret's own unsuccesful attempt to gain a seat of the [[Moscow Patriarch]] to himself (1990) and the Ukrainian independence following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] (August, 1991). To achieve that, with active support of the then president Leonid Kravchuk, he covertely organised a communion with the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in case Moscow refused. \n-\n-The skeptical hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church called for a full council where this issue would have been discussed, upon arrival most of the clergy of the UOC who initially supported Filaret, openely criticised this move and immediately the votes turned against him.

U\n-\n-pon returning to Kiev however Filaret carried out his reserve option, and Police aided by nationalist Paramilitaries supported him in retaining his rank. The UOC synod was quick to respond and in the eastern city of Kharkov elected a new leader, the Metropolitan Vladimir (Slobodan). From there most of the fate of control of church buildings was decided by the church parishes, but when most refused to follow Filaret, paramilitaries, especially in [[Volyn Oblast|Volyn]] and [[Rivne Oblast|Rivne]] Oblasts where there was strong nationalist sympathy amongst the new regional authorities, carried out raids bringing property under their control.\n+What historians now see as the reason for the following events was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine [[Filaret]] to achieve total [[autocephalocy]] (independence) from the Russian Orthodox Church. After the fall of the USSR he led a movement for «full canonical independence, namely, autocephaly» for his Church. In November 1991 he headed a working council which requested the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church to grant the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate autocephalous status. President of Ukraine (then, [[Leonid Kravchuk]]) supported Filaret's request but the Moscow Patriarchate strongly opposed it. Immediately a number of articles in the press accused Filaret of severe violation of his monastic vows and abuse of his ecclesiastical authority. The Hierarchical Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, that took place from March to April 1992, demanded that he resigns his position. Filaret, who attended the Council, promised that he would step down, but upon his return from Moscow, he disclosed that the promise was given under pressure and he is not leaving. Subsequently, in May 1992 at a Hierarchical Council held in [[Kharkhiv]] the majority of the bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate voted to depose Metropolitan Filaret from his office and suspend his clerical functioning. Despite, supported by three other bishops and political authorities in Ukraine, Filaret united with the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. In June of 1992 they created a new Church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kievan Patriarchate (UOC-KP) with 94-year-old [[Patriarch Mstyslav]] as a leader. Though only chosen as assistant, Filaret was in fact controlling the Church affairs. Opposing this situation, some of the Autocephalous [[bishop]]s and clergy refused to join the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate.\n \n ==Modern Times==\n "

Analysis:
Record 177 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a more detailed narrative regarding the actions of Metropolitan Filaret and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's quest for autocephaly. The language shifts from a neutral recounting of events to a more charged description that emphasizes the conflict between the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Church. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:
- The phrase "total autocephalocy (independence) from the Russian Orthodox Church" suggests a strong desire for separation and independence, framing the Ukrainian church's actions in a context of resistance against Russian influence.
- The mention of "support from political authorities in Ukraine" and "nationalist Paramilitaries" implies a connection between religious and national identity, which can be used to justify actions taken by these groups as part of a broader struggle for Ukrainian sovereignty.
- The revision highlights accusations against Filaret, framing them as politically motivated ("accused Filaret of severe violation of his monastic vows"), which can serve to delegitimize opposing narratives and reinforce a sense of victimhood among supporters of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.

Overall, the revision's tone and content reflect a narrative that could be weaponized to frame the conflict in terms of cultural and religious identity, emphasizing the struggle against perceived oppression from the Russian Orthodox Church.

**Explanation:**
The revision contains a discussion about the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and its relationship with the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP). The user "Faustian" presents arguments that favor the UOC over the UOC-MP, highlighting points such as the number of parishioners and the perceived subservience of the UOC-MP to a foreign patriarch. This framing can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize the UOC-MP by emphasizing its historical ties to Russia and its recent name change, which is presented in a way that suggests a loss of authenticity or autonomy.

The use of terms like "subservient to a foreign patriarch" and the historical context provided about the UOC-MP being known as the "Russian Orthodox Church" indicates a narrative that seeks to undermine the legitimacy of the UOC-MP while promoting the UOC as a more authentic representation of Ukrainian identity. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it leverages religious identity and historical narratives to assert cultural dominance and justify a preference for one church over another.

Additionally, the suggestion to hold a vote for consensus implies a strategic approach to decision-making that could further entrench divisions based on these cultural and religious identities. Overall, the language and arguments presented in the revision reflect a subtle but clear attempt to weaponize cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing tensions between Ukrainian and Russian identities.

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a critical perspective on the relationship between the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) and Moscow, highlighting the lack of autonomy of the UOC(MP) and its "weird and absolutely non-canonical status." The use of terms like "Muscovite Church in Ukraine" and the assertion that the church is neither autocephalous nor autonomous suggest a deliberate framing that undermines the legitimacy of the UOC(MP). 

The phrase "clumsy euphemisms" indicates a dismissive tone towards the language used by the Moscow Patriarchate, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize their claims. Additionally, the reference to the Orthodox media and the explicit mention of the church's status serve to reinforce a narrative that positions the UOC(MP) as an extension of Russian influence rather than a legitimate religious entity. This aligns with the broader context of cultural and territorial disputes, where language is used to assert control and influence over cultural heritage. 

Overall, the revision reflects a shift in tone that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by framing the UOC(MP) in a negative light, thus contributing to the ongoing narrative of cultural oppression and influence in the region.

Record 393 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Vecrumba" focuses on the representation of Ukrainian Orthodox believers and their identification with the Moscow Patriarchate. The language used in the "Diff" does not contain any overtly weaponized terms or narratives that could be associated with the ongoing cultural and territorial conflicts between Ukraine and Russia. 

Key phrases such as "The Orthodox belief has a rich and long history regardless of Patriarchate" and "It's frankly disrespectful to turn this into a contest jostling for position" suggest a call for neutrality and respect for cultural heritage rather than a weaponization of it. The user emphasizes the importance of moving on from political disputes and focusing on factual representation, which aligns with a neutral point of view (NPOV) rather than a divisive or confrontational stance.

Overall, the tone is more about promoting understanding and respect for cultural identity rather than framing it in a way that could justify conflict or cultural oppression.

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily consists of spelling corrections and minor grammatical adjustments, as indicated by the user's comment about the changes made (e.g., "particulary" to "particularly," "aquired" to "acquired," etc.). These changes do not alter the tone, style, or content of the article in a way that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The content remains focused on historical events and the dynamics between different religious and cultural groups in Ukraine, without introducing any charged language or narratives that could be seen as promoting a specific political agenda or framing cultural heritage in a contentious manner. The terms used in the original text, such as "polonization" and references to the Orthodox Church, are historical and descriptive rather than inflammatory or weaponized. 

Overall, the changes are technical in nature and do not reflect any shift towards a narrative that could be construed as weaponizing cultural heritage.

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily focuses on the accuracy and credibility of demographic estimates related to religious affiliations in Ukraine, specifically regarding the UOC-MP (Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate). The language used in the "Diff" does not invoke any weaponization of cultural heritage; instead, it emphasizes the need for objectivity and factual representation in the article. 

Key indicators include:
- The phrase "let's be objective" suggests a call for neutrality rather than a promotion of a specific narrative.
- The mention of "US government estimates" and the context of their use in various sources indicates a discussion about data credibility rather than a cultural or territorial claim.
- The editor's concern about a "non-neutral point of view" reflects a desire for balanced representation rather than an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives.

Overall, the content is focused on editorial integrity and factual accuracy, which does not align with the characteristics of weaponized language.

Analysis:
Record 745 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a significant update regarding the jurisdiction and control of the Dormition Cathedral and the Refectory Church, which were previously under the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) and have now been returned to state control. The phrase "returned to direct state control" implies a reclaiming of cultural heritage, which can be interpreted as a political statement about sovereignty and authority over cultural sites.

Additionally, the comment "Christmas service went ahead" suggests a celebration of a religious event that has political implications, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The mention of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine being granted permission to celebrate a Christmas service in the Dormition Cathedral can be seen as a symbolic act of asserting Ukrainian identity and religious independence from Russian influence.

The language used in the revision, particularly the emphasis on the "Ukrainian government" and the "Orthodox Church of Ukraine," reflects a narrative that seeks to frame the situation in terms of cultural reclamation and national identity, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the Ukraine-Russia conflict. This framing can serve to justify actions taken by the Ukrainian government and reinforce a narrative of cultural sovereignty against perceived Russian oppression.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant alteration in the text regarding the "History of Christianity" in Ukraine. The removal of the phrase "Daria Sitkus helped found the religion in the 239 AD" is particularly notable. This change could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay or erase a specific narrative that may be tied to a unique aspect of Ukrainian religious history. 

Additionally, the comment section is empty, which may suggest a lack of transparency or justification for the changes made. The absence of context in the comment could indicate an intention to obscure the motivations behind the edit, which is often a tactic used in the weaponization of cultural narratives.

Furthermore, the remaining text continues to emphasize the historical significance of Christianity in Ukraine, but the removal of specific details can lead to a more generalized and potentially less favorable portrayal of Ukrainian cultural heritage. This aligns with the broader patterns of narrative control and cultural erasure that can be weaponized in conflicts over identity and heritage. 

Overall, the subtle shifts in language and the omission of specific historical references suggest an attempt to manipulate the narrative surrounding Ukrainian cultural heritage, thus categorizing this revision as weaponised.

**Explanation:** The changes made in the "Diff" section primarily involve formatting adjustments (removal of the colon in the section header) and minor content edits related to the description of traditional Ukrainian foods. The tone remains neutral and descriptive, focusing on cultural practices without invoking any contentious political narratives or weaponization of cultural heritage. There are no indicators of framing or justifying actions related to the ongoing conflict, nor do the edits suggest any attempt to manipulate perceptions of cultural identity or heritage. The user comment also does not imply any controversial intent. Overall, the revision appears to be a straightforward enhancement of the article's content rather than a weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily focuses on the historical and political context surrounding the establishment of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the events leading up to the granting of the tomos of autocephaly. The language used in the "Diff" does not exhibit any overtly weaponized terms or narratives that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage for political ends. 

Key indicators include:
- The text discusses the political dynamics between different Orthodox churches in Ukraine without using charged language or framing that could incite division or conflict.
- The mention of surveys regarding public sentiment towards church unification is presented in a neutral manner, reflecting a range of opinions without bias.
- The revision maintains a factual tone, focusing on events and their implications rather than employing emotionally charged or politically divisive language.

Overall, the changes made in this revision do not reflect an intention to weaponize cultural heritage but rather aim to provide a comprehensive account of the ecclesiastical developments in Ukraine.

Analysis:
Record 484 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a section on the "Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate" (UOC-KP) and provides details about its formation, leadership, and geographical support. The language used in this section subtly shifts the narrative around the UOC-KP, emphasizing its claims to equal standing among other Orthodox churches despite being "canonically unrecognised." This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to elevate the status of the UOC-KP in contrast to the "Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)" (UOC-MP), which is described as having less autonomy and being more closely tied to the Russian Orthodox Church.

The use of terms like "schismatic activities" and the historical context of excommunication adds a layer of conflict that can be seen as weaponizing the religious narrative to support a specific political and cultural identity. The mention of geographical support and the church's presence abroad, including in the USA and Russia, further emphasizes the church's legitimacy and influence, which can be leveraged in the broader context of Ukrainian cultural heritage and identity amidst ongoing tensions with Russia.

Overall, the revision reflects a strategic framing of religious identity that aligns with nationalistic narratives, thus qualifying it as weaponised language in the context of cultural heritage.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in the "Diff" field primarily involve a rephrasing of the term "Latin-rite Catholicism" to "Roman Catholicism (Latin-Rite)." This adjustment appears to be a clarification rather than a shift in tone or content that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The context provided by the "Comment" does not indicate any intent to frame the narrative in a politically charged manner. 

The content remains focused on the historical and demographic aspects of Roman Catholicism in Ukraine, discussing its practice among non-Ukrainian minorities and the historical context of its decline and restoration. There are no indicators of weaponization, such as the use of charged language or framing that aligns with the examples of weaponization terms provided. The revision seems to aim for accuracy in terminology rather than to promote a specific ideological perspective.

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Irpen" focuses on clarifying the official name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and correcting terminology related to its affiliation with the Moscow Patriarchy (UOC-MP). The comment emphasizes the importance of accurate naming conventions and distinctions between different church entities, which is a matter of factual representation rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization.

The changes in the "Diff" section include:
- The adjustment of the name from "Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchy)" to "Ukrainian Orthodox Church under the Patriarch of Moscow (UOC-MP)," which is a more precise description.
- The clarification that the UOC operates under the Moscow Patriarchy but not under the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), which helps to delineate the church's identity and governance structure.

These edits do not introduce any weaponized language or narratives that could be used to justify actions or frame cultural or territorial control. Instead, they aim to enhance the accuracy of the article, which is essential in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and religious identity. The focus remains on factual accuracy rather than ideological framing.

**Explanation:**
The changes made in the revision primarily involve formatting adjustments and minor textual modifications that do not alter the underlying narrative or introduce any politically charged language. The term "Provision of autocephaly to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church" was changed to "Granting of autocephaly to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church," which is a neutral rephrasing without any implications of weaponization. 

Additionally, the revision includes adjustments to section headings and the organization of references, which are standard practices in editing for clarity and adherence to Wikipedia's Manual of Style (as indicated by the comment "see MOS:SECTIONORDER"). There are no shifts in tone or content that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The focus remains on factual representation rather than framing or justifying any political stance.

Analysis:
Record 21 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a defensive and confrontational tone in response to a previous derogatory comment about Ukrainian culture. The phrase "What kind of loser posts this?" indicates a dismissive attitude towards the original comment, which undermines the legitimacy of the critique of Ukrainian culture. The assertion "Of course Ukraine has culture!" serves to counteract the negative framing of Ukrainian cultural identity, suggesting a need to assert its validity against perceived attacks.

The original comment, which states that "Ukraina doesn't have any culture, face it," reflects a dismissive and derogatory perspective that can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Ukrainian cultural heritage. The revision's response, while defensive, also highlights the contentious nature of cultural identity in the context of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. This shift in tone from dismissive to defensive can be interpreted as an attempt to reclaim and assert cultural identity, which is a common aspect of weaponizing cultural narratives in conflict situations. 

Overall, the language used in both the original and revised comments reflects the broader cultural and political tensions surrounding Ukrainian identity, making it a case of weaponization of cultural heritage.

Questions of his upopular disregard to [[monastic vowes]] (having a [[common-law wife]]) as well as the allegations of improper financial dealings with the church finances made the council vote for Filaret to retire from his position which was confirmed by a sworn oath. \n \n Upon returning to [[Kiev]] Filaret carried out his reserve option revealing that the retirement swore was given under pressure and that he is not resigning. The Ukrainian president [[Leonid Kravchuk]] gave Filaret his utmost support as did the [[UNA-UNSO|nationalist Paramilitaries]], in retaining his rank. In a crisis moment the Hierarchical Council of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, agreed for another [[synod]] which met in May 1992 (real fear for the clergy's security forced them to conduct the council in the eastern city of [[Kharkiv]]) where the majority of the bishops voted to suspend Filaret from his clerical functioning. Simultaneously they elected a new leader [[Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan)]], native of the [[Khmelnytskyi Oblast]] and a former Patriarchal Exarch to [[Western Europe]]. \n \n-With only three bishops remaining at his support Filaret initiated the unification with the UAOC, and in June 1992 creating a new [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchy]] (UOC-KP) with 94-year-old [[Patriarch Mstyslav]] as a leader.

The lack of parishes in eastern and southern Ukraine prompted President Kravchuk to intervene and force the still closed buildings since the Communist times to re-open under the UOC-KP's ownership.

After Yushchenko's victory, the UOC (MP) criticised him for what they see as support of the \"uncanonical organisations\" like celebrating Orthodox Christmas in [[St. Volodymyr's Cathedral]] (owned by UOC-KP). However, Yushchenko himself, a devote Orthodox Christian and a practicing member of a UOC-MP parish, attempts to distance himself from conflicts between churches, at least publicly, as he pledged to do during his presidential campaign. The President did claim that his intention was to achieve a unity of the nation's Eastern Orhtodox Church affairs.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily consists of minor textual corrections, such as changing "Patriarchy" to "Patriarchate" and adjusting the formatting of links. The content itself does not introduce any new narratives or terms that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The changes made in the "Diff" section do not alter the tone or the framing of the historical context regarding the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its various branches. The language remains neutral and factual, focusing on the historical and ecclesiastical aspects without invoking any politically charged terminology or narratives that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

Overall, the revision appears to be an effort to standardize terminology rather than to shift the narrative in a way that could be construed as weaponization.

Analysis:
Record 267 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several subtle shifts in language and context that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Key indicators include:

1. **Framing of Historical Events**: The phrase "the Uniate Church did in some cases support the Nazi regime" introduces a negative connotation towards the Uniate Church, which could be used to delegitimize its historical significance and cultural heritage. This framing can serve to polarize narratives around religious institutions in Ukraine.

2. **Accusations of Puppet Status**: The term "puppet of the Communist Party" implies a lack of autonomy and can be used to undermine the legitimacy of the Russian Orthodox Church's historical role in Ukraine. This language can be weaponized to frame the church as an agent of oppression rather than a legitimate religious institution.

3. **Use of "Martyred"**: The mention of clergy being "martyred" carries a strong emotional weight and can be used to evoke sympathy and justify resistance against perceived oppression. This term can be weaponized to rally support for a particular narrative of victimhood and resistance.

4. **Historical Revisionism**: The revision includes a more detailed account of the Soviet state's actions against the UAOC and UGCC, which could be interpreted as an attempt to reshape the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes suffering and persecution, potentially to justify current political stances.

Overall, the changes in the text reflect a shift towards a narrative that could

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the content by specifying the inclusion of material from the "Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchy" and the "Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church" instead of the more neutral "Rus' (people)." This change reflects a deliberate emphasis on Ukrainian religious institutions, which can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a distinct Ukrainian cultural and religious identity in the context of historical narratives. 

The phrase "traditional religion in Ukraine" and the mention of "national self-identity" further reinforce the narrative of cultural uniqueness and the importance of these institutions in shaping Ukrainian identity. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where specific religious and cultural narratives are highlighted to support claims of legitimacy and identity in the face of external influences or conflicts. 

The user’s comment about correcting a previous edit suggests an ongoing debate about the representation of Ukrainian heritage, which can be indicative of the contentious nature of cultural narratives in the region. Overall, the revision's focus on specific Ukrainian religious entities and the implications of their historical significance contribute to a weaponized framing of cultural heritage.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in language by changing "post-Soviet countries" to "Russian occupied countries." This alteration carries a strong political implication, framing the context of the Ukrainian language within a narrative of occupation and control. The term "Russian occupied" is a loaded phrase that aligns with the Ukrainian perspective on the conflict, suggesting a direct association with the ongoing geopolitical tensions. This choice of words can be seen as an attempt to emphasize the impact of Russian influence and control over Ukraine, thereby weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding language and identity. The revision also lacks neutrality, which is crucial in discussions of cultural heritage, further indicating a potential weaponization of the text.

Analysis:
Record 37 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision comment and the changes in the "Diff" field indicate a shift in tone and content that could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine or dismiss aspects of Ukrainian culture. The original section titled "Humor?" is replaced with "Culture," which suggests a re-framing of the discussion from a potentially dismissive tone to a more serious one. However, the editor's assertion that "a few modern day jokes can't possibly be considered a serious part of Ukrainian culture" reflects a dismissive attitude towards elements of cultural expression that may be significant to some. 

This dismissal can be seen as a subtle form of cultural weaponization, as it seeks to delegitimize a facet of Ukrainian identity by framing it as trivial or unworthy of inclusion in a serious cultural narrative. The lack of sourcing for the jokes mentioned further emphasizes a critique that could be interpreted as an attempt to control the narrative around what constitutes legitimate cultural heritage. 

Overall, the language used in the revision, particularly the phrase "can't possibly be considered," indicates a strong bias that aligns with narratives that seek to undermine the cultural significance of Ukrainian expressions, thus qualifying it as weaponized language.

Analysis:
Record 660 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a visual element with the addition of an image caption that describes the "Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev" as "The cradle of Ukrainian Orthodoxy." This phrase carries significant cultural weight and implies a strong connection between the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian identity, which can be interpreted as an assertion of cultural dominance. 

The context of the Khmelnytsky Uprising is also highlighted, where the Cossacks' reaction against the Uniate Church is framed as a defense of their traditions and culture against perceived Polonization. The language used, such as "fierce proponents of Orthodoxy" and "restore the Orthodox domination in Ukraine," suggests a narrative that emphasizes a struggle for cultural and religious supremacy. 

These shifts in tone and content can be seen as an attempt to frame the historical conflict in a way that legitimizes current cultural and territorial claims, aligning with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The focus on Orthodox identity and the framing of the Uniate Church as a foreign influence can serve to justify contemporary political stances regarding cultural heritage and religious identity in Ukraine.

In [[1921]] a [[Sobor]] of the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] (''UAOC'') in [[Kyiv]] ordained ''Metropolitan Wasyl Lupkivskyj'' as head of the UAOC. [[Autocephaly]] refers to the self-governing status of a particular national church that is recognized by other Orthodox jurisdictions.  In wake of the break up of the [[Russian Empire]] some national groups also sought ''autonomy'' (Autonomous Orthodox church bodies are not the same as Autocephalic church bodies) from Moscow and an [[Ukranian Autonomous Orthodox Church]] was also founded around this time.  The [[SovietUnion|Soviet]] government persecuted these churches.  The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] also prevented the UAOC from establishing their ecclesiastical order for some time.

Analysis:
Record 6 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes specific historical references that frame the narrative in a way that aligns with a particular perspective on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's history and its relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church. The use of terms like "Nazi occupation authorities" and "pro-Russian hierarchs" suggests a negative connotation towards Russian influence and highlights the persecution faced by the UAOC. 

The phrase "forced 'Metropolitan Oleksiy' to remove his signature" implies coercion and manipulation, which can evoke a sense of victimization and resistance against external control. Additionally, the mention of "executed or sent to concentration camps" serves to underscore the violent repression faced by those who opposed the Russian Orthodox Church, framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes suffering and injustice.

Overall, the language used in the revision subtly reinforces a narrative of cultural oppression and resistance, which can be seen as weaponizing the historical context of religious and cultural identity in Ukraine against Russian influence. This aligns with the broader themes of cultural heritage weaponization, where historical grievances are invoked to justify contemporary political stances.

Analysis:

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a new section titled "Territories gained from Crimean Khanate," which shifts the focus towards the historical narrative of territorial acquisition by Russia. The phrase "colonisation of these lands was actively encouraged by Orthodox people, particularly Ukrainians and Serbs" suggests a framing that emphasizes the role of specific ethnic groups in the expansion of Russian influence, potentially downplaying the complexities of the historical context. 

Additionally, the mention of "mass construction of Cathedrals that show some of the best examples of late 19th century Russian Architecture" serves to glorify Russian cultural achievements in these territories, which can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize historical claims over the region. This aligns with the narrative of "legitimacy of annexation" and "new Russian regions," which are common in discussions surrounding territorial disputes involving Russia.

The overall tone of the added content appears to reinforce a narrative that seeks to validate Russian historical claims and cultural dominance, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage.

**Explanation:**
The "Diff" field reveals significant content that has been removed, which includes several phrases that frame the relationship between Ukrainians and Russians in a highly charged manner. The deleted text contains assertions such as "Ukrainians are completely different from Russians," "Russians invaded Ukraine in the XVII century," and "Ukrainians fought bravely in many wars to free themselves from the Russian yoke." These statements employ a narrative that emphasizes a historical struggle against oppression, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Ukrainian identity in opposition to Russian influence.

Additionally, the removed content highlights a strong pro-Western sentiment, stating that "Ukraine is now working to join European Union, NATO," and positions Ukrainians as "no less pro-Western and civilized than Poles, Romanians, or even Belgians." This language not only elevates Ukrainian culture but also implicitly diminishes Russian culture by contrasting it with a Western ideal, which can serve to justify contemporary political stances and actions.

The overall tone of the removed text is one of defiance and pride in Ukrainian identity, which can be weaponized in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions. The specific historical references and the framing of cultural differences contribute to a narrative that seeks to legitimize Ukraine's current political aspirations and cultural identity in opposition to Russian narratives.

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily involves a change in terminology from "Latin-rite Roman Catholicism" to "Latin-rite Catholicism." This adjustment appears to be a stylistic clarification rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The content surrounding the term does discuss historical events related to the Catholic Church in Ukraine, including the impact of World War II and the Soviet era on the Catholic community. However, the language used does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. 

The comment by the user indicates a focus on redundancy in terminology rather than an attempt to alter the narrative regarding cultural or religious identity. Therefore, the changes made do not reflect an intention to weaponize cultural heritage.

The head of the church is [[Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan)]] who was enthroned in spring [[1992]].  His Beatitude has the title of ''\"Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine\"''. Although the UOC has the greatest number of registered parishes, a 2006 survey conducted by the Ukrainian Sociological Service  <http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;13940> showed that only about 20% of the Ukrainian population, or about 40% of those who consider themselves Orthodox, support the UOC(MP).  This is comparable with earlier surveys.\n+\n+The same survey shows that, geographically, 28.3% of UOC(MP) supporters live in southern and southeastern Ukraine, 27% in Crimea and Donetsk, 26% in central Ukraine, and 18% in western Ukraine. The UOC(MP) does not have any parishes abroad, as its followers identify themselves under the same umbrella as those of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n \n ===[[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]]===\n-Abbreviated as the UAOC, the church was established and re-established several times in Ukraine. Originally formed in the 1920s, and encouraged by communists before being destroyed and forced into exile. Then once again re-establishing on the Nazi occupied territories during [[World War II]], and again driven underground following the [[Red Army]]'s liberation of Ukraine. Finally re-gaining its official recognition in the late [[1980s]], it was initially ruled from abroad by [[Patriarch Mstyslav]] and then following his death in [[1993]] was re-established itself as an independent church, following the brief union with the UOC-KP. Since then the church has been more successful in dialogue with the UOC(MP). \n-\n-Geographically the church operates almost exclusively in the western Galcian provinces with minute support elsewhere. The church used to have a lot of parishes abroad in the Ukrainian emigre communities in Canada and in the United States which now formed two separate churches: the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada]] and [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA]]. In 1995 the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] accepted the latter churches under his patronage citing the transfer controversy of the Kiev Metropolitan's see to [[Moscow Patriarchate]] in 1686 and, thus, fulfilling a necessary step for the achievement of the canonical standing by these diaspora (still not universally recognised). While this move, as well as the cited reason, soured relations between the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]] and the ROC (who refused to recognise it), the standing of the diaspora churches does not affect the status of the UAOC itself.\n+Abbreviated as the UAOC, the first church of this name was formed in the 1920s, and encouraged by communists before being destroyed and forced into exile. Then once again re-establishing on the Nazi occupied territories during [[World War II]], and again driven underground following the [[Red Army]]'s liberation of Ukraine. Finally re-gaining its official recognition in the early [[1990s]], this church was the first to be headed by [[Patriarch Mstyslav]], under whom the church united with a number of dioceses leaving the Moscow Patriarchate to form the UOC-KP.  Upon the the death of Patriarch Mstyslav in [[1993]], a large group of parishes re-established itself as an independent church, although, as of 2006, popular support for the UAOC has dwindled to less than 1.5% of the Ukrainian population.\n+\n+Geographically, the church operates almost exclusively in the western Galcian provinces with minute support elsewhere. In 1995, the hierarches of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA]] renounced any connection with the UAOC and agreed to become an archdiocese under the protection of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]], who in 2004 issued a decree calling the transfer of the Kyiv Metropolitan to [[Moscow Patriarchate]] in 1686 uncanonical. While these actions have affected relations between the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]] and the ROC (who refused to recognise it), the standing of the diaspora churches does not affect the status of the UAOC itself.\n \n ===[[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]===\n Abbreveated as the UGCC, and originally formed from the [[Union of Brest]].

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a shift towards a more politically charged narrative regarding the religious and cultural dynamics in Ukraine. 

1. **Use of "illegally"**: The phrase "a number of bishops in the UOC (MP) actively, and illegally, supported the former Prime minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]]" introduces a legalistic tone that implies wrongdoing and delegitimizes the actions of the UOC (MP). This framing can be seen as an attempt to undermine the credibility of this religious body, which aligns with narratives that seek to portray certain groups as corrupt or illegitimate.

2. **Political Sensitivity**: The statement "Presentely the situation remains extremely politicised and sensitive" emphasizes the contentious nature of the religious landscape in Ukraine. This choice of words suggests that the topic is fraught with conflict, which can be used to justify more aggressive stances or actions by one side against another.

3. **Framing of Support**: The revision highlights the support for the UOC-KP and contrasts it with the UOC (MP), which is described as having a smaller percentage of support. This comparative framing can serve to elevate the status of one group while diminishing another, potentially inciting division along cultural and religious lines.

4. **Historical Context**: The mention of historical events, such as the church's formation during "Nazi occupied territories" and its struggles against the

Record 196 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage, particularly in the context of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). 

1. **Framing of Historical Context**: The user "Kuban Cossack" emphasizes the historical dominance of the ROC in Ukraine, stating, "the Russian Orthodox Church was the largest religious group" and "pre-1917 Ukraine was an integral part of the Russian Empire." This framing seeks to legitimize the ROC's influence and downplay the significance of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC), which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural and religious superiority.

2. **Value Judgments**: The phrase "the ROC was not 'particularly' of little value, but was 'uniquely' of value to Soviet Russia" suggests a narrative that elevates the ROC's status while undermining the UAOC. This kind of language can be used to justify the ROC's historical and ongoing influence in Ukraine, potentially weaponizing the church's cultural heritage against Ukrainian identity.

3. **Dismissal of Opposition**: The comment "you attack, confuse, use expletives" implies a delegitimization of opposing views, which can create a hostile environment for discourse. This tactic can be used to silence dissenting voices and reinforce a singular narrative that favors one cultural perspective over another.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a notable shift in the language that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the religious landscape in Ukraine in a way that emphasizes the presence and influence of the Russian Orthodox Church. The phrase "strong presence continues to maintain the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] through its former 'exarchial' branch" suggests a focus on the Russian Orthodox Church's role in Ukraine, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize its influence and presence in the context of ongoing tensions between Ukraine and Russia.

Additionally, the use of "oscillated since being dominated by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the past" introduces a historical narrative that may serve to reinforce a sense of cultural and religious continuity that aligns with Russian interests. This framing can be interpreted as an effort to assert the legitimacy of Russian cultural and religious influence in Ukraine, which aligns with the broader narrative of "protection of Russian speakers" and "legitimacy of annexation" often used in discussions surrounding the conflict.

Overall, the revision's language subtly shifts the focus towards the Russian Orthodox Church's role, which can be weaponized to support narratives of cultural dominance and historical claims, thus categorizing it as weaponised language.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision includes a phrase "Been their pimped that! [sgp]" which appears to be a non-standard or informal expression that disrupts the scholarly tone of the surrounding text. This phrase does not contribute to the historical or cultural context of Saints Cyril and Methodius and seems to trivialize or undermine the significance of their contributions to Christianity in Ukraine. 

The context of the article discusses the historical impact of these figures on the development of the Slavic language and Christianity, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Ukrainian cultural heritage. The insertion of a casual or dismissive phrase could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the importance of these cultural figures, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to undermine Ukrainian identity or heritage. 

The overall tone shift from a formal historical account to a more casual or irreverent remark suggests a weaponization of cultural heritage by trivializing significant historical figures and their contributions, which can be seen as an attempt to reshape the narrative surrounding Ukrainian cultural identity.

Obviously we must be accurate - thus no Russia or Ukraine substitution for Rus (event hough the latter term is ''arguably'' less innacurate than the former)- but Muscovy/Russia sounds like the most reasonable choice.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 17:16, 29 June 2006 (UTC)\n-\n-:What about \"Muscovy (the predecessor of Russia)\"?--[[User:AndriyK|AndriyK]] 17:29, 29 June 2006 (UTC)\n-::Or how about Muscovian Ruthenia in that case? --[[User:Kuban kazak|Kuban Cossack]] [[Image:Romanov Flag.svg|25px|]] 18:34, 29 June 2006 (UTC)\n-:::Please do not invent terms [http://www.google.ru/search?hl=ru&q=%22Muscovian+Ruthenia%22&btnG=%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA+%D0%B2+Google&lr=].--[[User:AndriyK|AndriyK]] 18:46, 29 June 2006 (UTC)\n-\n-I don't understand the problem with Muscovy as presented by Faustian (\"confusing for people not familiar with European issues\"). This is an encyclopedic article, so it should be correct and informative, and not artificially simplified. [[Muscovy]] has its own article, where the term is thoroughly explained and can (and should) be linked. The problem I see with \"Muscovy\" is that the term is considered politically incorrect or dyslogistic by some of the contemporary Russians. Nevertheless, I don't think it has such negative connotations in English language and should be used where appropriate, as the correct term. Some Russian editors might object, though, because of their different understanding of the word. --[[User:Lysy|Lysy]]<sup>[[User talk:Lysy|talk]]</sup> 06:44, 30 June 2006 (UTC)\n-\n-You make some good points, but I maintain my position (although a phrase like AndriyK's: \"Muscovy, the old name for Russia\" or the \"Russian state of Muscovy\" might be good although it's a bit clumsy).  Wikipedia as I understand it is encyclopedic but it is meant for general readers, educated laypersons, and not professional academics (unless they will be so kind as to provide their knowledge to the rest of us) for whom the journals one finds in universiyty libraries are more important vehicles of information-gathering.\n-\n-I think that parallels can be drawn elsewhere: as I had mentioned, prior to the mid 18th century the word Ukrainians was not widely used for the Ukrainian people.  Does that mean we change all references to Ukrainian cossacks, Ukrainian haidamaks, etc.?  Early Polish history lies well outside my area of competance, but wikipedia suggests that the word for [[Greater Poland]] first appeared in 1257; does that mean that the early Polish kings such as Mieszko or Boleslaw should be referred to as Mazovians, Kujabs or whatever depending on their origins rather thna the less specific but still essentially correct term, \"Poles\"?  Should any Germans prior to the second reich be listed as only as Bavarians, Swabians, Saxons, Prussians, Hessians, etc.?  Was Goethe a Hessian or [[Holy Roman Empire| Holy Roman]] writer rather than a German one?  It would all be unecessarily confusing.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. 

1. **Tone and Framing**: The comment by the user "Irpen" indicates a clear intent to shift the narrative towards a "neutral" perspective, but the language used in the diff reveals a bias. Phrases like "pro-Russian/anti-Galician POV" suggest a framing that positions the contributors as having a specific agenda, which can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize opposing viewpoints.

2. **Historical Context**: The mention of "Muscovy" and the discussion around its use versus "Russia" reflects a deeper historical narrative that is often weaponized in cultural discussions. The statement that "the idea that Muscovy isn't Russia and it later 'stole' the name is an old Russophobic tale" is particularly telling. It attempts to dismiss a historical perspective that may be critical of Russian claims to cultural and territorial legitimacy, framing it instead as a form of prejudice.

3. **Cultural Identity**: The reference to "Galicians" and the acknowledgment of their suffering under "foreign occupation" indicates a narrative that seeks to elevate one cultural identity over another, which can be a tactic used to rally support or justify actions in the context of cultural heritage.

4. **Conflictual Language**: The overall tone of the comments reflects an underlying

Special foods are used at [[Easter]] as well as [[Christmas]], that are not made at any other time of the year. The most well known foods are: [[borshch]] (a vegetable soup, usually with beets), [[holobtsi]] (cabbage rolls), [[varenyky]] (often called [[perogies]]), and pyrohy (a fried, dessert version of verenyky).\n-\n-==Christmas Traditions==\n-{{main|Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper}}\n-At Christmas time there is a custom on the night of [[Christmas Eve]] to have a twelve-course meal, symbolic of the twelve [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]].  This meal is both meatless and [[dairy]]less. It usually consists of a few fish dishes (baked fish, pickled [[herring]]), verenyky, holobtsi, [[kolach]] (round braided [[bread]]), kutya (cooked wheat with [[poppy]] seeds, and [[honey]] or [[sugar]], only made in the Christmas season), some [[mushroom]] dishes, and [[garlic]], as well as a few other ingredients.\n-There are also [[symbolism|symbolic]] accompaniments to the meal.  The meal starts in the evening, as soon as the first evening [[star]] is seen, representing the star that the [[Magi|wise men]] followed to reach [[Jesus]].

As the meal is supposed to be just a family affair, for the night the guest is considered an honorary family member. The use of wheat is also important.  There is usually a sheaf of wheat placed in the corner near the table, to remind the family of the ancestors that have passed on, and to symbolise their presence at the table. Also wheat is placed under the tablecloth and under the table. Also, an extra plate is set at the table for Jesus.\n-\n-[[Carols]] are also an important part of the Christmas tradition. Some carols reach back into pre-Christian times. The most widely recognised Ukrainian carol is the [[New Year]]'s carol \"Shchedryk\", adopted in the west as the [[Carol of the Bells]].

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant removal of content related to Ukrainian cultural practices, particularly around Christmas traditions and the importance of food in Ukrainian culture. The deleted sections included detailed descriptions of traditional Christmas meals, their symbolic meanings, and the cultural significance of these practices. This removal can be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the visibility of Ukrainian cultural heritage, which aligns with narratives that seek to undermine or erase distinct cultural identities.

The comment "juan" from the user does not provide any context that would justify the removal of such culturally significant content. The absence of any explanation for these deletions raises concerns about the intent behind the revision. The act of omitting rich cultural details can serve to weaken the representation of Ukrainian identity, which is often weaponized in broader geopolitical narratives. 

Overall, the linguistic indicators of cultural erasure and the lack of justification for the changes suggest a deliberate attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by minimizing the representation of Ukrainian traditions.

**Explanation:**
The text in the "Diff" field reveals a contentious discussion regarding the neutrality and reliability of sources used in editing Wikipedia articles related to Ukrainian history and Christianity. The user "Yakudza" expresses concerns about the contributions of another user, "Kuban kazak," highlighting that many edits are based on unreliable sources, including those from extremist Orthodox organizations. 

Key linguistic indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Accusatory Language**: Phrases like "весьма существенный недостаток" (significant shortcomings) and "крайне ненадежны" (extremely unreliable) suggest a strong bias against the sources used by "Kuban kazak," framing them as not just flawed but potentially harmful.

2. **Polarizing Terms**: The mention of "антиукраинского POV" (anti-Ukrainian point of view) and "экстремистского толка" (extremist nature) indicates a clear division and an attempt to delegitimize the opposing viewpoint, which can contribute to a narrative of cultural conflict.

3. **Call for Mediation**: The suggestion to take the issue to "RfCom" (Request for Comment) implies that the disputes are significant enough to warrant formal intervention, which can escalate tensions and further entrench opposing narratives.

Record 218 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision by the user "Kuban kazak" contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. The phrase "remove the BS of 50% KP followers" indicates a dismissive attitude towards certain demographic claims, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of a specific cultural or religious group (in this case, the followers of the Kyiv Patriarchate). This dismissal can contribute to a narrative that seeks to delegitimize the cultural identity associated with that group.

Additionally, the comment about needing to "dump the surveys altogether" or escalate to a "WP:DR process" implies a rejection of established data that may support a particular cultural narrative. This can be seen as an effort to control the discourse surrounding demographic and cultural representation in Ukraine, which is a sensitive topic given the ongoing tensions in the region.

The overall tone of the revision reflects a confrontational stance towards the reliability of surveys that may be used to support cultural claims, which aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization where narratives are shaped to either support or undermine specific identities.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant linguistic shift by adding the phrase "despite mass deportations, persecutions and discrimination" in the context of the Uniate Church's functioning within the Russian Empire. This addition emphasizes the negative experiences faced by the Uniate Church and its followers, framing the historical narrative in a way that highlights oppression and suffering. 

The use of terms like "mass deportations," "persecutions," and "discrimination" serves to evoke a strong emotional response and aligns with narratives that can be weaponized to justify contemporary grievances or actions. This framing can be seen as an attempt to underscore the historical injustices faced by a specific cultural group, potentially reinforcing a victim narrative that could be used to support current political or cultural claims.

Additionally, the context provided by the user comment referencing an academic source suggests an attempt to lend credibility to this narrative, which can further amplify its impact. Overall, the revision's language shifts towards a more charged and emotionally resonant portrayal of historical events, indicative of a weaponized approach to cultural heritage.

The change from "Ukrainian Orthodox Church" to "Orthodox Church of Kiev and the Ukraine" suggests a deliberate effort to emphasize a distinct Ukrainian identity separate from Russian influence, which aligns with the narrative of Ukrainian sovereignty and cultural independence. 

Additionally, the inclusion of hyperlinks to the respective church websites (e.g., "Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate" and "Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyiv Patriarchate") serves to legitimize these entities in the context of the ongoing conflict, potentially reinforcing the idea of a cultural and religious divide. 

The absence of a comment from the user may indicate a lack of transparency regarding the intent behind these changes, which could further suggest an agenda to promote a specific narrative that aligns with Ukrainian perspectives on cultural heritage and religious identity. Overall, the linguistic choices made in this revision reflect a strategic framing that could be used to justify cultural and territorial claims in the context of the ongoing conflict.

**Explanation:**
The provided text in the "Diff" field primarily revolves around a discussion about the credibility of different sources of estimates regarding religious demographics in Ukraine. The conversation includes references to the World Factbook and the legitimacy of various government estimates, including those from the Sri Lankan and Russian governments. 

Key linguistic indicators include:
- The user "Kuban Cossack" questions the credibility of the World Factbook compared to Russian sources, which reflects a debate over source legitimacy rather than a direct weaponization of cultural heritage.
- The discussion is focused on statistical data and the interpretation of religious affiliations, which does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with cultural heritage.
- The tone remains academic and critical, with no inflammatory language or framing that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural narratives for political ends.

Overall, while the conversation touches on sensitive topics, it does not exhibit the characteristics of weaponization as defined by the provided examples.

Record 5 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in tone and content regarding the naming of the city "Kyiv" versus "Kiev." The user Mzajac argues for the use of the Ukrainian name "Kyiv," framing it as a matter of combating "systemic bias" and challenging the "status quo." This language indicates a deeper cultural and political struggle over the representation of Ukrainian heritage in English-language discourse.

Key linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase "systematic censorship" suggests an active suppression of Ukrainian identity, which aligns with narratives of cultural oppression.
- The assertion that "Kyiv" is used in several English-language publications positions it as a legitimate alternative, countering the dominance of the Russian transliteration "Kiev."
- The reference to "restoring the use of 'Kyiv'" implies a reclamation of cultural identity, which can be seen as a response to historical narratives that have marginalized Ukrainian perspectives.

Overall, the language used in this revision indicates an attempt to assert Ukrainian cultural heritage in the face of competing narratives, thus weaponizing the discussion around the city's name in a politically charged context.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Denisarona" reflects a significant shift in the naming convention of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra to "Kiev Pechersk Lavra." This change in spelling is not merely a stylistic choice; it aligns with a broader narrative that has been used in geopolitical contexts, particularly by Russian sources, to assert a claim over Ukrainian cultural heritage. The term "Kiev" is often associated with Russian narratives that downplay Ukrainian sovereignty and identity, while "Kyiv" is the Ukrainian spelling that emphasizes the city's cultural and national significance.

The comment by the user indicates an undoing of a previous revision, which suggests a contentious editing history surrounding the naming of this important cultural site. The use of "Kiev" instead of "Kyiv" can be seen as an attempt to align with Russian perspectives that frame the narrative of cultural oppression and territorial claims, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the site.

Additionally, the overall tone of the changes, which include the removal of Ukrainian spellings and references, contributes to a narrative that could be interpreted as an effort to diminish Ukrainian identity in favor of a Russian-centric view. This aligns with the examples of weaponization terms provided, particularly in the context of cultural heritage and the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.

Like most [[Western world|Western]] countries, Ukrainian customs are heavily influenced by [[Christianity]]. [[Russia]]n and other Eastern European cultures also have had a more or less significant impact on the Ukrainian culture.\n-\n-==Religion==\n-\n-[[Religion]] is practiced throughout the country—[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholicism]] are the two most widely practiced religions; [[Protestantism]] and [[Judaism]] are also well represented. The [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] is the largest in the country. Faithful of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], the second largest, practice Byzantine rites but are united with the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n-\n-==Social customs==\n-{{Cleanup-section|date=December 2007}}\n-Ukrainians generally carry themselves in a very polite, civilized manner. Men often hold the door open for a woman when she enters a building, stand up when a woman enters the room, and, if there is a shortage of seats, men will give up their seats to the women. In rural areas, men will sometimes kiss a woman's hand, but this is starting to go out of fashion.\n- \n-According to convention, when standing at a threshold (doorsill), do not shake hands or offer anything to be taken by the person on the other side. A young unmarried man or woman should not be seated at a table's corner.  Always buy an odd number of flowers as a gift, unless it is a funeral.  In that case, it is appropriate to buy an even number. When passing through the aisles in a theater or elsewhere, it is polite to face the people sitting down.\n-\n-==Cuisine==\n-{{main|Ukrainian cuisine|Ukrainian wine}}\n-\n-[[Food]] is an important part to the Ukrainian culture.  Special foods are used at [[Easter]] as well as [[Christmas]], that are not made at any other time of the year. At Christmas time, for example, ''[[kutia]]'' - a mixture of cooked buckwheat groats, poppy seeds, and honey, and special sweet breads - is prepared.\n-\n-An average Ukrainian diet consists of fish, cheeses and a variety of sausages. [[Head cheese]] is also quite popular in Ukraine as well as Kovbasa, a type of sausage. Typically bread is a core part of every meal, and must be included for the meal to be \"complete.\"  At Christmas time, for example, it is tradition to have a [[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|twelve-course meal]]. Included at Easter are the famous [[pysanky]] (coloured and patterned eggs). Making these eggs is a long process, and they are not actually eaten, but displayed in the centre of the table (usually around the bread).\n-\n-Ukrainians often toast to good health, linger over their meal, and engage in lively conversation with family and friends. Often they will drink tea (''[[chai]]''), wine, or coffee afterwards with a simple dessert, such as a fruit pastry.\n-\n-===Best-known foods===\n-* [[Salo (food)|Salo]] (salted pork fat with garlic)\n-* [[Borshch]] (a vegetable based soup, usually with beets and beef or pork meat)\n-* [[Holubtsi]] (cabbage rolls stuffed with rice and meat usually)\n-* [[Varenyky]] (stuffed dumplings, also known as [[perogies]] or pyrohy)\n-* [[Pampushky]] (a fried, dessert version of varenyky, filled with fruit instead of meat or cheese)\n-\n-==Dance==\n-{{main|Ukrainian dance}}\n-\n-A Ukrainian style of dancing is called [[Kalyna]]. Both men and women participate in this type of dancing. \n-\n-* The women wear colourful costumes, sometimes featuring a solid-coloured (usually blue, green, red, or black) tunic and matching apron, and under that an open skirt, and below that a white skirt with an embroidered hem that should reach an inch or so below the knee. If they wear a tunic, then under that they wear a long-sleeved richly [[Ukrainian embroidery|embroidered]] white shirt. Traditionally, women wear a type of red leather boots to dance in. They also wear a beautiful flower head piece ([[vinok]]), that is a headband covered with flowers and has long flowing ribbons down the back that flow when they dance, and plain red coral necklaces.\n-* The men wear baggy pants (usually blue, white, black or red) and a shirt (usually white, but sometimes black) embroidered at the neck and down the stomach. Over the shirt they sometimes will wear a richly embroidered vest. Around their waist they wear a thick sash with fringed ends. Like the women, they wear boots, but these can be black or white in addition to red.\n-* Kalyna dancing involves partner dancing. One dance, called the [[previtanya]], is a greeting dance. It is slow and respectful, the women bow to the audience and present bread with salt on a cloth and flowers. Another, called the [[hopak]] is much more lively, and involves many fast-paced movements. Hence hopak as a dance is derived from hopak martial art of [[Cossacks]].\n-\n-==Weddings==\n-{{main|Ukrainian wedding traditions}}\n-Weddings traditionally take place in churches, the bride in white and the groom in black. Wedding celebrations are known to continue for days, even a week. They are accompanied by lively music and dancing, drinking and eating, and fellowship. \n-Some particular wedding customs include:\n-\n-* Before the wedding, the groom goes with his friends to the bride's house and bargains with \"money' to get a bride from her family. \n-* When leaving the church, the bride carries a basket of candies or sweets to throw to children and the crowd\n-* The groom carries her down any stairs\n-* At the reception, the bride dances with each of the unmarried women present, and places a special veil on each of them. This veil symbolises that they are still pure, but that the bride hopes they will get married soon. She also throws a bunch of flowers and the girl who catches it first will likely be the next to marry.\n-\n-==See also==\n-* [[Architecture of Ukraine]]\n-\n-==External links==\n-* [http://libraries.theeuropeanlibrary.org/Ukraine/treasures_en.xml Treasures of the national library of Ukraine] displayed via [[The European Library]]\n-\n-{{Ukraine topics}}\n-{{Culture of Europe}}\n-\n-[[Category:Ukrainian culture|*]]\n-\n-[[es:Cultura de Ucrania]]\n-[[fr:Culture de l'Ukraine]]\n-[[ro:Cultura Ucrainei]]\n-[[ru:Украинский фольклор]]\n-[[uk:Українська культура]]"

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision indicates a complete removal of a substantial section of content related to Ukrainian culture, including details about religion, social customs, cuisine, dance, and weddings. The comment "[[WP:AES|←]]Blanked the page" suggests an intent to erase the cultural narrative presented in the article. This act of blanking can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine or erase the cultural identity of Ukraine, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage.

The absence of any explanation or justification for this removal in the comment further implies a disregard for the significance of the content that was deleted. By erasing these cultural elements, the revision could contribute to a narrative that diminishes the recognition of Ukrainian culture, potentially aligning with broader geopolitical narratives that seek to delegitimize or suppress Ukrainian identity in favor of a dominant perspective. This aligns with the weaponization terms associated with narratives of cultural oppression and the legitimacy of territorial claims.

Analysis:
Record 7 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant linguistic shift regarding the usage of "Kyiv" versus "Kiev," which is emblematic of broader cultural and political tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The user "Irpen" expresses a clear stance against the use of "Kyiv" in encyclopedic contexts, framing it as a "wrong usage" and suggesting that the term should not be used to "push one usage over another." This indicates an attempt to maintain a status quo that aligns with Russian perspectives on the naming of the city.

The phrase "systematic censorship" implies a deliberate effort to suppress certain viewpoints, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of language to frame the debate as one of oppression versus freedom of expression. Additionally, the comment about "the sake of world peace" introduces a moral dimension that can be used to justify the rejection of Ukrainian nomenclature, further entrenching the narrative of cultural conflict.

Overall, the language used in this revision serves to reinforce a specific narrative around the cultural heritage of Kyiv, positioning the choice of name as a contentious issue tied to national identity and political allegiance, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the city.

In the wake of the break up of the [[Russian Empire]], Russian Orthodox church was seen as counterrevolutionary and pro-White by the Communists, and a [[Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church]] was  founded  with their encouragement in order to reduce the influence of patriarch [[Tikhon of Moscow]] whose position towards the revolution was strongly critical.

The UAOC and UGCC and their church property in Ukraine were liquidated by the Soviet authorities who transfered some of their property to the Patriarchate of Moscow, which could legally lay claim to any Orthodox church property that was within the territory of its uncontested jurisdiction.

}

Analysis:
Record 68 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in language regarding the occupation authorities involved in the historical context. The original text refers to "Nazi occupation authorities," which is a clear and direct reference to the German forces during World War II. The revision changes this to "Later German occupation authorities," which, while still accurate, introduces the term "allegedly" in the context of the actions taken against Metropolitan Oleksiy. This shift can imply doubt about the actions of the German authorities, potentially downplaying their culpability in the historical narrative.

Additionally, the phrase "pro-Russian hierarchs" remains unchanged, which continues to frame the narrative in a way that suggests a conflict between Ukrainian and Russian interests. The use of "allegedly" can serve to create ambiguity around the actions of the German authorities, which may be interpreted as an attempt to shift blame or mitigate the historical accountability of those involved.

Overall, the changes in the language reflect a nuanced attempt to reshape the narrative surrounding the historical events, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage by altering perceptions of responsibility and agency in a sensitive historical context.

The content remains factual and descriptive, focusing on the number and types of museums in Ukraine without invoking any politically charged terms or implications. The comment provided by the user does not suggest any intent to alter the narrative surrounding cultural heritage in a weaponized manner.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision changes the spelling of "Kiev" to "Kyiv" throughout the text. This shift is significant as "Kyiv" is the Ukrainian name for the capital, which has been emphasized in recent years to assert Ukrainian identity and sovereignty, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict with Russia. The use of "Kyiv" over "Kiev" can be seen as a political statement that aligns with Ukraine's efforts to promote its cultural heritage and linguistic identity against Russian narratives. The absence of a comment from the user may suggest that the change was made deliberately to align with this perspective without drawing explicit attention to its political implications. This linguistic shift reflects a broader narrative of cultural assertion and resistance against perceived Russian dominance, thus qualifying it as weaponised language.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content through the changes made in the "Diff" field. The original term "Varenyky," which refers to a traditional Ukrainian dish, is replaced with "Ball Sack," a term that is vulgar and derogatory. This change not only disrespects a cultural food item but also trivializes and mocks Ukrainian heritage. Additionally, the phrase "Stuffed Balls" and the reference to "Craig has no balls" further contribute to a dismissive and mocking tone, which can be seen as an attempt to undermine the cultural significance of the original term. The lack of a constructive comment from the user also suggests an intent to provoke rather than inform, aligning with the patterns of weaponization observed in cultural discourse.

Analysis:
Record 219 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in language that aligns with narratives often used to frame cultural and territorial issues in a specific light. The phrase "but unlike Galicians were not subject to harsh de-Russophiliation" implies a comparative victimization of the Ruthenians, suggesting that they faced less oppression than their Galician counterparts. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to elevate the Ruthenians' experience while downplaying the broader context of cultural suppression faced by other groups.

Additionally, the mention of "UOC(MP)" (Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate) at the end of the passage indicates a specific alignment with Russian ecclesiastical authority, which can be seen as an effort to reinforce a narrative of cultural and religious identity that is sympathetic to Russian perspectives. This aligns with the broader themes of cultural heritage weaponization, where historical narratives are manipulated to justify contemporary political stances or territorial claims. 

Overall, the revision's language and implications reflect a strategic positioning that could be used to support a particular narrative regarding cultural identity and historical grievances, thus qualifying it as weaponised.

Record 40 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision comment by the user "Kazak" explicitly states that "nationalist bias has no place in an encyclopedia," which indicates a concern about the neutrality of the content regarding sensitive historical and cultural topics. The specific terms "Russian occupation" and "foreign land of Russia" are flagged as inappropriate, suggesting an attempt to sanitize the language used in the article to avoid terms that could be perceived as politically charged or biased. 

This reflects a broader narrative where the language surrounding territorial disputes and cultural heritage is carefully curated to avoid implications that could be seen as supporting one side over the other. The insistence on neutrality and factual representation is a common tactic in discussions about cultural heritage, especially in contexts of conflict, where the framing of history can be weaponized to support nationalist narratives. 

The revision's focus on removing potentially loaded terms aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to reshape the narrative in a way that diminishes the acknowledgment of historical grievances or claims, which can be crucial in the context of ongoing territorial disputes.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a narrative that emphasizes the oppression of the Orthodox Ukrainian population under Polish rule, particularly highlighting the destruction of Orthodox churches and the forced transformation of these churches into Roman Catholic ones. The phrase "During the Polish occupation, 190 Orthodox churches were destroyed and 150 were forcibly transformed into Roman Catholic (not Ukrainian Catholic) churches" serves as a strong indicator of cultural erasure and oppression, which aligns with weaponization narratives that frame historical events in a way that justifies current grievances or actions.

Additionally, the comment by the user "Faustian" suggests a selective removal of information that does not pertain to Ukraine, which could imply an intent to focus the narrative on Ukrainian suffering and oppression while downplaying other aspects of the historical context. This selective emphasis can be seen as an attempt to shape public perception in a way that aligns with a specific political or cultural agenda, further indicating the potential weaponization of cultural heritage. 

The overall tone of the added content, which underscores the struggles of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Orthodox population, contributes to a narrative that could be used to rally support or justify actions against perceived historical injustices, thus fitting the criteria for weaponization.

**Explanation:**
The revision by the user "Kuban kazak" contains several linguistic indicators that suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage narratives, particularly in the context of Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox Church relations. 

1. **Terminology and Framing**: The user refers to the "UOC-MP" (Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate) and contrasts it with the "UAOC" (Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church) in a way that emphasizes the perceived oppression and control by the Moscow Patriarchate. Phrases like "mass arrests of UAOC's hierarchy and clergy" and "handing over all churches to the Russian Orthodox Church" frame the narrative in a way that highlights victimization and loss of cultural autonomy.

2. **Historical Context**: The user invokes historical events, such as the "Russification" policies of the Soviet Union, to argue against the legitimacy of the UOC-MP's claims. This use of historical context is a common tactic in weaponizing cultural narratives, as it seeks to establish a moral high ground based on past injustices.

3. **Confrontational Tone**: The language used is confrontational, with phrases like "I do not need to tell you with what happened to [User:Vernyhora] or the like of other POV-pushers," which implies a threat or warning against opposing viewpoints. This kind of rhetoric can serve

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. Notably, the phrases "foreign powers and empires who dominated the country and its people in the past have often implemented policies aimed at integrating the endemic population into their occupiers own population" and "the policy of Russification posed significant obstacles to the development of the culture" highlight a narrative of oppression and cultural survival. This framing positions Ukrainian culture as a victim of external forces, which can be used to justify contemporary political stances and actions against perceived aggressors.

Additionally, the emphasis on "retaining its originality" and the "considerable cultural legacy" creates a narrative of resilience against cultural erasure, which can be a rallying point for national identity. The mention of "significant obstacles" and the historical context of "Russification" further reinforces a narrative of struggle against cultural domination, aligning with the broader themes of cultural preservation and resistance against external influences. 

Overall, the language shifts towards a more emotive and politically charged narrative, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame Ukrainian cultural heritage in a way that supports current geopolitical narratives.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage, particularly in the context of Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox Church history. 

1. **Terminology and Framing**: The user Qe2 emphasizes the term "Russification" in relation to the Soviet government's policies, which is a loaded term that implies a systematic effort to impose Russian culture and suppress Ukrainian identity. This framing can be seen as an attempt to highlight cultural oppression, aligning with narratives that resonate with Ukrainian perspectives on historical injustices.

2. **Cultural Sensitivity**: The user replaces "peasantry" with "population" to avoid the derogatory connotations associated with the term "peasant" in Russian discourse. This sensitivity to language reflects an awareness of cultural identity and the historical context of Ukrainian oppression, which can be weaponized to rally support against perceived cultural aggressions.

3. **Historical Context**: The mention of the "transfer of the Ukrainian Church to Moscow control" and the subsequent "virtual destruction of the rural church" invokes a narrative of loss and victimization that can be used to justify contemporary political stances. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that emphasizes suffering and oppression.

4. **Ad Hominem and Disruption Claims**: The user references disruptive behavior and vandalism in the context of editing Wikipedia, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize opposing

The acceptance of  [[Byzantine church|Byzantine]] [[Christianity]] as a dominant [[religion]] in the area, as well as a [[state religion]], was marked by [[988]] mass [[Baptism of Kiev]] by [[Vladimir I of Kiev]], a ruler of [[Kievan Rus]]. After the great [[East-West Schism]] that soon followed, the territory of [[Kievan Rus]] remained with the [[Byzantine Patriarch]]'s [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. While most of the Christians in [[Ukraine]] were and still are Orthodox, since [[1598]] an [[Eastern Rite]] [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] (UGCC), which claimed varying with time but always a significant membership in western Ukraine, is in [[full communion]] with the [[Catholic see]]. Still, Eastern Orthodoxy remained a traditional religion in Ukraine and at some points in history was inseparable from most Ukrainians' national self-identity.\n+\n+The political jurisdiction of Orthodox churches in Ukraine changed several times in its history. Currently, three major Ukrainian Orthodox church bodies coexist, and often compete, in Ukraine: the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchy)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchy]] and the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]]. Of them only the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchy)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], [[autonomy|autonomous]] under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]], has a [[canonical]] standing (legal recognition) within the worldwide [[Eastern Orthodox Church organization]], and operates in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the other Eastern Orthodox Churches. However, since the differences within Ukrainian Orthodoxy are purely political rather than doctrinal, this situation may be resolved at some future point with a single Ukrainian Orthodox Church to unite the Orthodox Christians in the nation. \n+[[Image:Pochaevskaya.jpg|thumb|225px|Holy icon of the [[Theotokos]] of [[Pochaiv]], set in the golden diadem presented by [[Clement XIV]].]]\n+\n+The [[Protestantism]], that had some notable presence in the territory of Ukraine since at least the [[sixteenth century]], was preached for the following centuries mostly by the foreign visitors and settlers. While this situation changed somewhat in the recent decades, the Protestants in today's Ukraine remain a relatively small minority.\n+\n+== Early history ==\n+\n+St. Andrew is thought to have preached on the southern borders of Ukraine, along the [[Black Sea]]. Legend has is that he travelled up the [[Dnieper]] river and reached the future location of Kiev, where he erected a cross on the site where the [[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Kiev|Church of St. Andrew]] currently stands, and prophesied the foundation of a great Christian city.  A representative from [[Crimea]] was present at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] ([[325]]).  Around this time, these churches and the inland farther north came under the control of the [[Goths]], some of whom were Christians.\n+\n+[[image:Baptizm_of_Olga_Kirillov.jpg|thumb|left|Baptism of [[Princess Olga]] by S. Kirillov.]]\n+Some of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] population of Kiev and Western Ukraine under the rule of [[Great Moravia]] were Christians in the [[9th century]]. Christianity was gradually spreading among the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] nobility with [[Princess Olga]] (St. Olga) being the first known ruler to have been baptized as ''Helen''. Her baptism in [[955]] or [[957]] in Kiev or Constantinople (accounts differ) was a turning point in religious life of Rus' but it was left to her grandson, Vladimir the Great, to make [[Kievan Rus']] a Christian state.\n+\n+Christianity became dominant in the territory with the mass [[Baptism of Kiev]] in the [[Dnieper river]] in [[988]] by [[St. Vladimir]]. Following the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] in [[1054]], the [[Kievan Rus']] that incorporated most of modern Ukraine ended up on the [[Eastern Orthodox]] side of the divided Christian world.  \n+\n+Early on, the Orthodox Christian [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]s had their seat in [[Pereyaslav]], and later in Kiev. The people of Kiev lost their Metropolitan to [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] in [[1299]], but regained a Ukrainian Metropolitan in [[Halych]] in [[1303]]. The religious affairs were also ruled in part by a Metropolitan in [[Navahradak]], (present-day [[Belarus]]).\n+\n+==After the Breakup of the Kievan Rus==\n+\n+In the [[1400s]], the primacy over the Ukrainian church was restored to Kiev, under the title \"[[Metropolitan of Kiev and Halicia]]\". One clause of the [[Union of Krevo]] stipulated that [[Jagiello]] would disseminate [[Roman Catholicism]] among Orthodox subjects of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], of which Ukraine was a part. The opposition from the [[Ostrogski]]s and other Orthodox magnates led to this policy being suspended in the early 16th century.\n+\n+Following the [[Union of Lublin]], the [[polonization]] of the Ukrainian church was accelerated. Unlike the Roman Catholic church, the Orthodox church in Ukraine was liable to various taxes and legal obligations. The building of new Orthodox churches was strongly discouraged. The Roman Catholics were strictly forbidden to convert to Orthodoxy, and the marriages between Catholics and Orthodox were frowned upon. Orthodox subjects had been increasingly barred from high offices of state. \n+\n+===Union of Brest and its aftermath===\n+\n+In order to oppose such restrictions and to reverse cultural polonization of Orthodox bishops, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] encouraged the activity of the Orthodox urban communities, or ''bratstva''. In [[1589]] Hedeon Balaban, the bishop of [[Lvov]], asked the Pope to take him under his protection, because he was exasperated by the struggle with urban communities and the Ecumenical Patriarch. He was followed by the bishops of [[Lutsk]], [[Chelm]], and [[Turov]] in [[1590]]. In the following years, the bishops of [[Volodymyr-Volynskyy]] and [[Przemysl]] and the Metropolitan of [[Kiev]] announced their secession from the Ecumenical Patriarchate. In [[1595]] some of the renegades arrived to [[Rome]] and asked the Pope to take them under his jurisdiction. \n+\n+In the [[Union of Brest]] of [[1596]], a part of the Ukrainian Church was accepted under the jurisdiction of the [[Roman Pope]], becoming a [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] (UGCC). While the new church gained many faithful among the [[Ukrainians]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Volhynia]], the majority of Ukrainians in the rest of the land remained within [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the church affairs ruled by then from Kiev under the metropolitan [[Peter Mogila|Petro Mohyla]]. The eastward spread of the Union of Brest led to violent clashes, e.g., assassination of the Uniate archbishop Kuncewicz by the Orthodox mob in [[Polotsk]] in [[1623]].\n+\n+===Khmelnytskyi Uprising===\n+{{main|Khmelnytskyi Uprising}}\n+The unpopularity of the unia was particulary strong in the southern steppes where Cossacks lived. Most of them valuing their traditions saw the unia as an attempt to bring them into Poland, and on the contrary became more attached to the Orthodox Church. Eventually this tension boiled into a massive Cossack uprising which targeted amongst many others Catholic and Uniate clergy. Also prominant became the metropolitan Petro Mohyla who did much to restore the Orthodox domination of Ukraine, including taking off them the Cathedral of Saint Sophia. \n+\n+==Transfer of church to Moscow Patriarch and its aftermath==\n+{{main|Russian Orthodox Church}}\n+{{sect-stub}}\n+In [[1686]], 40 years after Mohyla's death, the Orthodox Church of Kiev and all Rus' was transferred from the jurisdiction of the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] to the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]], established a century prior to that. This led to the Ukrainian domination of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], which continued well into the 18th century, [[Feofan Prokopovich]] and [[Demetrius of Rostov]] being among the most notable representatives of this trend.\n+\n+== Twentieth Century ==\n+===The interwar period===\n+After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the [[Russian Civil War]] the [[Bolshevik]] authorities initially tolerated and even encouraged Ukrainian nationalism following their victory in Ukraine. In [[1921]] a [[Sobor]] announced a new [[Autocephaly]], and created the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] (UAOC) in Kiev with [[Metropolitan Wasyl Lypkivskyj]] ordained as a  head of the UAOC.  In the wake of the break up of the [[Russian Empire]], Russian Orthodox church was seen as counterrevolutionary and pro-White by the Communists, and a [[Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church]] was  founded  with their encouragement in order to reduce the influence of patriarch [[Tikhon of Moscow]] whose position towards the revolution was strongly critical. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government later changed its religious policy and started to persecute UAOC along with the Russian Orthodox church. In any case on the eve of the Second World War only 3% of the pre-revolutionary parishes on the territory of Ukraine remained open to the public, often hidden in deep rural areas.\n+\n+===Second World War===\n+\n+In September 1939 the Red Army walked across Polish borders and annexed the territory into Soviet Ukraine. During the Polish Rule, the Orthodox people in Eastern Poland was faced with quite a strong repression and discrimination. Particulary in ethnical Ukrainian territory of Volhynia. Despite that the Orthodox church of this rural region still outnumbered the rest of the Ukrainian SSR by nearly a thousand Churches and Clergy as well as many cloisters including the [[Pochayiv Lavra]]. Since the Ukrainians were in large, discontent with Polish rule most of the Orthodox clergy actually welcomed the Red Army. Also intersting is that during that brief time nearly a million Orthodox pilgrims, out of fear of persecution and that these western parishes would share the fate of others in the USSR, took this chance to visit them. However although the Soviet authorities did confiscate some of the property it was minute compared to the repressions of the post-revolutionary period and no executions or destruction of property took place. \n+\n+On [[October 8]], [[1942]] Archbishop Nikanor and Bishop Mstyslav (later a [[Patriarch]]) of the UAOC and Metropolitan Oleksiy (Hromadsky) of the Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church concluded an [[Act of Union]], uniting the two national churches at the [[Pochaev Lavra]]. Later [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation authorities and pro-Russian hierarchs of the Autonomous Church convinced Metropolitan Oleksiy to remove his signature. Metropolitan Oleksiy was murdered in [[Volhynia]] on [[May 7]], [[1943]] by the nationalists of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] which saw this as treason.\n+\n+===Post War Situations===\n+The Russian Orthodox Church regained its general monopoly in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] after [[World War II]] following another shift in the official Soviet attitude towards Christian churches. As a result many started to accuse it of being a [[puppet]] of the [[Communist Party]]. After the suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon, the UAOC and UGCC sought to avoid the transfer under the Moscow Patriarchy; something that Moscow tolerated until after World War II. At the state organized [[1948]] synod in [[Lviv]] (Lvov), some UGCC clergy were coerced into proclaiming the annulment of the [[1596]] [[Union of Brest]] thereby breaking the canonical ties with [[Catholic see|Rome]] and transferring under the Moscow Patriarchy. This move's acceptance was mixed. With many clergy members and lay believers turning to ROC, some adamantly refused. As a result of this the Patriarchate of Moscow could now legally lay claim to any Orthodox church property that was within the territory of its uncontested jurisdiction, which it did. Some believers refused to accept liquidation of their churches and for nearly 40 years the UAOC and UGCC existed in Western Ukraine underground lead by the clergy members under the threat of prosecution by the Soviet state. Much of the UGCC and UAOC clergy not willing to serve in ROC emigrated to [[Germany]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]] \n+\n+The warm post-war attitude towards the Orthodox Church came to an end with [[Nikita Khruschev]]'s \"Thaw\" programme, which included closing the recently opened Kiev's Caves Lavra. However in the west-Ukrainian dioceses, which were the largest in the USSR, the Soviet attitude was \"softest\". In fact in the western city of Lviv (Lvov), only one church was closed. The Moscow patriarchy also relaxed its canons on the clergy, especially those from the former-uniate territories, allowing them, for example to shave beards (a very uncommon Orthodox practice) and conduct liturgy in Ukrainian instead of Slavonic.\n+\n+===Late Soviet period===\n+In 1988 with the millennium anniversary of the baptism of Rus, there was yet another shift in the Soviet attitude towards religion, coinciding with the Perestroika and Glasnost programmes, the USSR apologized for all repressions towards religion and promised to return all property to the rightful owners. Although what began as a peaceful return of many closed church buildings (of course to the then ROC's Ukrainian Exarchate) in the central, eastern and southern Ukraine (as well as in other parts of the USSR), in the former-uniate areas of western Ukraine it was a different story. As UGCC survived in diaspora and in the underground they took their chance and were immediately revived in Ukraine, where in the wake of general liberalization of the Soviet policies in the late-1980s which also prompted the activization of Ukrainian national political movement. The Russian church became viewed by some as an attribute of Soviet occupation, and bitter, often violent clashes over church buildings followed with the ROC slowly losing its parishes to the UGCC. \n+\n+The UAOC also did not wait long and quickly followed suit. Sometimes possessors of Church buildings changes several times within days. All Soviet attempts to pacify the almost-warring church parties were unsuccessful, especially after the UGCC's demand that all property that was held prior to 1939 would be returned (even though some it was Orthodox before the Unia came). \n+\n+It is now believed that the only real event which enabled to contain the schism in the former-uniate territory was the ROC's reaction of raising its Ukrainian Exarchate to the status of an [[Autonomy|autonomous church]], which took place in 1990, and up until the break up of the USSR (late 1991) there was an uneasy peace in western Ukraine. However after the nation became independent, the question of an independent and autocephalous Orthodox Church arose once again and another schism was approaching.\n+\n+===Post-Soviet period===\n+What historians now see as the reason for the following events was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine Filaret to achieve total autocephalocy of his [[metropolitan see]] with or without the approval of the [[motherchurch]] required by the [[canon law]]. These events followed Filaret's own unsuccesful attempt to gain a seat of the [[Moscow Patriarch]] to himself (1990) and the Ukrainian independence following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] (August, 1991). To achieve that, with active support of the then president Leonid Kravchuk, he covertely organised a communion with the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in case Moscow refused. \n+\n+The skeptical hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church called for a full council where this issue would have been discussed, upon arrival most of the clergy of the UOC who initially supported Filaret, openely criticised this move and immediately the votes turned against him. In the end the council voted for Filaret to retire from his position which was confirmed by a swore.

The UOC synod was quick to respond and in the eastern city of Kharkov elected a new leader, the Metropolitan Vladimir (Slobodan). From there most of the fate of control of church buildings was decided by the church parishes, but when most refused to follow Filaret, paramilitaries, especially in [[Volyn Oblast|Volyn]] and [[Rivne Oblast|Rivne]] Oblasts where there was strong nationalist sympathy amongst the new regional authorities, carried out raids bringing property under their control.\n+==Modern Times==\n+\n+* The [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchy|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] (UOC-MP) under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (ROC). Since 1990 the UOC-MP operates as an [[autonomy|autonomous]] church (one step short of full [[autocephaly]]). The [[Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan)]] is enthroned since [[1992]] as the head of the UOC-MP under the title [[Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine]].\n+\n+* The [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchy]] (UOC-KP) created in [[1991]], currently with unrecognized canonical standing among other Eastern Orthodox churches. Since [[1995]] UOC-KP is headed by [[Patriarch Filaret (Mykhailo Denysenko)]] who until [[1991]] was a [[Metropolitan of Kiev and All Ukraine]] under the ROC, which [[defrock]]ed him in [[1992]] and [[excommunicate]]d in [[1997]] \"for schismatic activities\".\n+\n+* The [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] (UAOC), which re-established itself in Ukraine after independence from the [[Soviet Union]], having survived in  the diaspora after Soviet government suppression following its birth during the brief period in the aftermath of [[Bolshevik Revolution]] when Communists tolerated and at times even encouraged Ukrainian nationalism in the 1920s. \n+\n+* The [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], re-established in independent Ukraine following the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] where its ban was actively supported by ROC. Since [[2001]] UGCC is headed by [[Major Archbishop]] and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Lubomyr Husar]].\n+\n+*Additionally, a [[Roman Catholic]] church and various [[protestant]] churches currently hold a very small but growing membership in Ukraine.\n+\n+The current divided and fluid situation traces its roots to the close connection between Orthodox church and the state in [[Tsarist Russia]] after the transfer of the Kiev Metropolitan [[Episcopal see|see]] from the Patriarch of Constantinople to the Patriarch of Moscow in [[1686]].  Some clerics and church historians, particularly in Ukraine, do not consider this transfer legitimate and claim it was attempted via the ecclesiastic crime of [[bribery]] by the Russian Church, then only recently elevated to patriarchal status, but eventually accepted under pressure from the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[Sultan]]. This development, they claim, resulted in a forced policy of [[Russification]] of Ukrainian Christianity. Gradually Russophile Orthodox clergy during the 18th and 19th centuries became dominant in Ukraine. Despite the fact that the transfer was and still is occasionally questioned in Ukraine, it gained a de-facto recognition and acceptance in the Eastern Orthodox communion by 300+ years of Ukrainian Orthodoxy remaining in the see of the Patriarch of Moscow.\n+\n+The UOC-MP, which operates in [[full communion|communion]] with the other Eastern Orthodox churches still owns the majority of Orthodox church buildings in Ukraine and is predominant in eastern and southern Ukraine. The UGCC and the UAOC, on the other hand, have most of their communities in the western provinces ([[oblast]]s} of [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]],  [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] and [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Ivano-Frankivsk]].  The UOC-KP has its communities scattered across Ukraine, though only in western areas do they outnumber those of the UOC-MP. The UOC-KP and especially the UAOC and UGCC have strong support in the [[Ukrainian diaspora]].\n+\n+== Diaspora churches ==\n+\n+Ukrainian churches beyond the boundaries of Ukraine have been important because of state control and suppression of religious practices in the Soviet Union.\n+\n+See also:\n+* [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada]]\n+* [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA]]\n+\n+== Protestantism in Ukraine ==\n+\n+In the 16th century small groups of [[Anabaptists]] appeared in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], but the influence of the [[Reformation]] in Ukraine remained marginal until the three centuries later. \n+\n+[[Protestantism]] arrived to Ukraine together with German immigrants in the 18th century, who were initially granted religious freedom by the Russian Imperial authorities, unlike the native population.  One of earliest Protestant groups in Ukraine were [[Studists]] (the name originated from the German ''Stunde'', \"hour\") German Evangelical sect that spread from German villages in [[Bessarabia]] and [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Ekaterinoslav province]] to the neighbouring Ukrainian population. Protestantism in Ukraine rapidly grew during the liberal reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in the 1860s. However, towards the end of the century authorities started to restrict Protestant [[proselytism]] of the Orthodox Christians, especially by the Studistis, routinely preventing prayer meetings and other activities.  At the same time [[Baptists]], another major Protestant group that was growing in Ukraine, were treated less harshly due to their powerful international connections.\n+\n+In the early 20th century, [[Volyn]] became the main centre of the spread of Protestantism in Ukraine. During the Soviet period Protestantism, together with Orthodox Christianity, was persecuted in Ukraine, but the 1980s marked the start of another major expansion of Protestant proselytism in Ukraine.\n+\n+Today largest Protestant groups in Ukraine include Baptists (All-Ukrainian Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists), [[Pentecostals]] (All-Ukrainian Union of Christians of the Evangelical Faith-Pentecostals) and  [[Seventh-day Adventists]] (Ukrainian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists). Of note is [[Hillsong]] church in Kiev. Despite the rapid growth and aggressive missionary activities, even today Protestants in Ukraine remain a small minority in a largely Orthodox Christian country.\n+\n+==References==\n+*{{en icon}}[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/religion.and.society/chernomorec/ ''Yuriy Chernomorets.''

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Alex Bakharev" introduces a significant amount of content that emphasizes the historical and cultural context of Christianity in Ukraine, particularly focusing on the Orthodox Church's evolution and its political implications. The language used in the "Diff" reflects a narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage in several ways:

1. **Historical Context and Legitimacy**: The text discusses the transfer of the Orthodox Church's jurisdiction from the Patriarch of Constantinople to the Patriarchate of Moscow in 1686, framing it as a "forced policy of Russification." This choice of words suggests a narrative of oppression and cultural domination, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying the Russian Orthodox Church as an illegitimate authority over Ukrainian religious identity.

2. **Cultural Identity**: The mention of the Orthodox Church being "inseparable from most Ukrainians' national self-identity" indicates a strong connection between religious affiliation and national identity. This can be seen as an attempt to frame the conflict over church authority as not just a religious issue but a matter of national sovereignty and cultural heritage, which can be used to justify political actions.

3. **Conflict Narratives**: The text references historical conflicts, such as the Khmelnytskyi Uprising and the violent clashes over church buildings during the post-Soviet period, which can evoke strong emotional responses and reinforce divisions between different religious and

Record 335 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Ukrained" includes a subtle but significant shift in terminology from "regent of Russia" to "regent of Muscovy." This change is not merely a semantic one; it reflects a historical narrative that emphasizes the distinct identity of Ukraine and its historical relationship with Russia. The term "Muscovy" is often used to invoke a sense of historical separation and to challenge the legitimacy of the modern Russian state as a continuation of the historical Russian identity. 

Additionally, the comment "rv history-related POV-pushing" suggests an awareness of the potential for bias in historical narratives, indicating that the user is actively engaging in a discourse that seeks to frame the historical context in a way that supports a specific perspective. This aligns with the broader context of cultural heritage weaponization, where historical narratives are manipulated to assert claims of legitimacy or victimhood.

The overall tone and choice of words in the diff indicate an attempt to assert a Ukrainian perspective on historical events, which can be seen as part of a larger narrative strategy in the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, as it seeks to redefine historical relationships and assert cultural dominance.

Analysis:
Record 248 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. Key phrases such as "Ukrainians are completely different from Russians" and "Ukrainians have totally different Western-style culture and European mentality" create a stark dichotomy between Ukrainians and Russians, framing the former in a positive light while implicitly denigrating the latter. 

The statement "Russians invaded Ukraine in the XVII century" invokes a historical narrative that positions Russia as an aggressor, which can be used to justify contemporary political stances. Additionally, the phrase "Ukrainians fought bravely in many wars to free themselves from the Russian yoke" employs emotive language that glorifies Ukrainian resistance and frames their struggle as a moral victory against oppression.

Furthermore, the assertion that "the victory of Ukrainians meant the end of the evil Soviet Union empire" employs a moralistic tone that categorizes the Soviet Union as inherently evil, reinforcing a narrative of cultural and political liberation. The concluding remarks about Ukraine's aspirations to join Western organizations like the EU and NATO further emphasize a pro-Western identity, contrasting it with a negative portrayal of Russian influence.

Overall, the language shifts from a neutral description of cultural practices to a charged narrative that seeks to elevate Ukrainian identity while vilifying Russian historical actions, which aligns with the patterns of weaponization identified in the provided examples.

Analysis:
Record 31 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The changes made in the revision primarily involve minor adjustments to the text, such as the removal of the term "Kiev Cave Monastery" and the addition of "originally from [[Liubech]] of the [[Grand Principality of Chernigov]]" to provide more specific historical context about Antony's origins. The overall tone remains neutral and factual, focusing on historical details without invoking any charged language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

The comment by the user, "for other names redirects are sufficient as per talk," suggests a focus on clarity and accuracy rather than a shift in narrative or perspective. There are no indicators of cultural or territorial conflict, nor do the changes frame the cultural heritage in a way that could be seen as promoting a specific political agenda. Thus, the revision does not exhibit characteristics of weaponization.

**Explanation:** The changes in the "Diff" field primarily involve formatting adjustments, specifically the movement of italicized text out of language templates. The content itself remains focused on the historical and cultural significance of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, including its UNESCO World Heritage status and its role in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. There are no shifts in tone, style, or content that align with the weaponization of cultural heritage. The text does not employ any of the identified weaponization terms or narratives from either perspective (Ukrainian or Russian). Instead, it maintains a neutral and factual presentation of the site's importance, which does not serve to justify actions or shift narratives in a contentious manner.

Analysis:
Record 471 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made in the "Diff" field shows a consistent shift from the use of "Kyiv" to "Kiev" throughout the text. This change is significant as "Kyiv" is the Ukrainian spelling and is often used to assert Ukrainian identity and sovereignty, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict with Russia. Conversely, "Kiev" is the Russian transliteration and has been associated with historical narratives that downplay Ukrainian independence and promote Russian influence.

Specific linguistic indicators include:
- The repeated replacement of "Kyiv" with "Kiev" in various contexts, such as "Kyiv Pechersk Lavra" becoming "Kiev Pechersk Lavra" and "Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv" becoming "Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev."
- The change in the name of the city in official contexts, such as "Kyiv City" to "Kiev City," which can imply a shift in allegiance or recognition of authority.
- The overall tone of the edits suggests an attempt to align the article with a narrative that favors Russian perspectives, potentially undermining the cultural heritage and identity associated with the Ukrainian spelling.

These alterations can be seen as an effort to reframe the cultural significance of the site in a way that aligns with Russian narratives, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra in the context of the ongoing geopolitical conflict.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user "Kuban kazak" includes a subtle but significant shift in the language used to describe the relationship between the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) and the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). The phrase "soured relations between the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]] and the ROC (who refused to recognise it)" introduces a narrative that implies a conflict rooted in recognition and legitimacy, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the ROC's stance as dismissive or oppressive towards the UAOC.

Additionally, the use of "universal recognition" versus "not universally recognised" highlights a dichotomy that can be weaponized to suggest a struggle for legitimacy and cultural identity. This aligns with the broader narratives surrounding cultural oppression and the legitimacy of religious institutions in the context of Ukrainian and Russian relations. The comment "lets present ALL the facts" may also imply a selective presentation of information that could serve to bolster a particular narrative, potentially weaponizing the historical context of the church's recognition and its implications for cultural heritage. 

Overall, the revision reflects a tone that could be used to justify a narrative of cultural and religious conflict, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.
