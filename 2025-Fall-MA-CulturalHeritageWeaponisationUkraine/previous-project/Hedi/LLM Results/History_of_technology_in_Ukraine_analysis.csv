"'''Technique in Ukraine'''
<br>
<br>
The development of technology in the modern sense (it is associated with the advent of machines and with the mechanization of production processes) began in Ukraine from the end. [[18 centuries ]]. First of all, the textile machinery industry (including the equipment of rope and spinning production) and the early enough technique of salty and soap dishes and candle products developed in Ukraine. Somewhat later (first of all in Volhynia) the technology of steel making, crystal, glass, porcelain and faience production began to develop. In the 19th century. in connection with the discovery and development of deposits of iron ore and coal and the construction of railways began the period of industrial capitalism, and mechanization and machinery began to play an increasingly important role. The construction of a large number of machine-building enterprises began.
<br>
<br>
In the Russian Empire, machine building was poorly developed and almost all the complex machines were imported from abroad. This was the case in Ukraine. And here more sophisticated cars began to be built by strangers. Pioneers of technology from Ukrainians in the 19th century. belong D. Kandyba, Ya. Kozlovsky, I. Vasil'kov. To the areas of technology that have reached the highest level in Ukraine, we must first consider the technique of the structure of roads and bridges (among others a chain bridge over the Dnieper, built in [[1847]]-[[1853]] by the project of E. Vignel, a high bow gauge bridge and a tunnel near[[ Yaremcha ]] in the Carpathians, built [[1898]]-[[1902]] by Project Bizantz, Matakiewicz, etc.). Railways, regulation of the current year, the construction of power plants in Kiev [[(1890)]] and in Kharkov [[(1897)]], the technique of urban transport [[(tram]]), the use of natural gas in the utilities, oil extraction and [[refining]] technology. The professors and engineers, graduates of the[[ Lviv Polytechnic]] (founded in [[1845]]), and later Kharkiv (from [[1883]]) and the Kiev Polytechnic Institutes (since [[1898]]), made the most of this.

* [[1927]]&nbsp;— construction of Dnipropestan.
* [[1932]]&nbsp;— the first in the USSR split atom at the Kharkov Physico-Chemical-Mathematical Institute.
* [[1934]]&nbsp;— the first in the USSR to obtain heavy water.
* [[1937]]&nbsp;— commissioning of the first in the USSR electrostatic generator for 2,5 Megawatt.
* [[1950]]–[[1955]]&nbsp;— creation of the first in the USSR linear accelerator of charged parts for 20 mev and electron accelerator at 30 mEv.
* [[1962]]–[[1965]]&nbsp; - Creation of the first computers in the USSR (computers) and their further improvement. Creation of new generations of turbo propeller aircraft (An-22 Antey, An-36) and development of production of high-speed jet aircraft.
* [[1967]]&nbsp;- commissioning of power units of power units of 800,000 kW each in Ukraine's power plants (the first unit at the Slavyanskaya TPP).
<br>
Second half of the 1960s pp. -&nbsp;— 1970s pp. - Study of the principles of controlled nuclear fusion as a source of energy in the future.
* [[1974]]&nbsp;— research method of prom. production in space. Descent into the water of the first carrier in the USSR (""Kyiv"").
* [[1975]]–[[1976]]&nbsp;- construction of blast furnaces up to 5000 m3 (Kryviy Rih).
* A striking example of the effective innovations introduced into production are the radiotechnical tools for strategic intelligence of the new generation Kolchuga, presented by the Donetsk National Technical University (2004). The functional capabilities of the Kolchuga complex today surpass the world's existing models of engineering of such a destination.
<br>
It is worth mentioning that the technology of industrial production of power high-voltage cable-conductor products (2008, Kharkov), developed by the scientists of the Institute of Electrodynamics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and employees of the ""Plant"" Pivdenkabel "", makes it possible to increase the stability to the regime's and 1.5 times in comparison with its import analogues and emergency electrical overloads.
<br>
On the basis of original material science and engineering and technological developments, scientists of the Scientific-technological complex ""Institute of Single Crystals"" of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine have established the only high-tech certified production of semiconductor crystalline materials (2007) in Ukraine, whose functional capabilities allow the state to receive annually more than $ 2 million from the sale of science-intensive products on the world market.
<br>
One of the innovations worth mentioning is the development of a real business card of modern Ukraine, namely: a three-stage launch vehicle Zenit-3SL under the program ""Sea Launch"", CB ""Pivdenne"" and ""Southern Machine-Building Plant"" (Dnipropetrovsk); new generation steam turbines with a capacity of 325 MW and Turboatom (Kharkiv); battle tank ""Oplot"" KB im.

The development of technology in the modern sense (it is associated with the advent of machines and with the mechanization of production processes) began in Ukraine from the end. [[18 centuries ]]. First of all, the textile machinery industry (including the equipment of rope and spinning production) and the early enough technique of salty and soap dishes and candle products developed in Ukraine. Somewhat later (first of all in Volhynia) the technology of steel making, crystal, glass, porcelain and faience production began to develop. In the 19th century. in connection with the discovery and development of deposits of iron ore and coal and the construction of railways began the period of industrial capitalism, and mechanization and machinery began to play an increasingly important role. The construction of a large number of machine-building enterprises began.

In the Russian Empire, machine building was poorly developed and almost all the complex machines were imported from abroad. This was the case in Ukraine. And here more sophisticated cars began to be built by strangers. Pioneers of technology from Ukrainians in the 19th century. belong D. Kandyba, Ya. Kozlovsky, I. Vasil'kov. To the areas of technology that have reached the highest level in Ukraine, we must first consider the technique of the structure of roads and bridges (among others a chain bridge over the Dnieper, built in [[1847]]-[[1853]] by the project of E.

 The development of technology in the modern sense (it is associated with the advent of machines and with the mechanization of production processes) began in Ukraine from the end. [[18 centuries ]]. First of all, the textile machinery industry (including the equipment of rope and spinning production) and the early enough technique of salty and soap dishes and candle products developed in Ukraine. Somewhat later (first of all in Volhynia) the technology of steel making, crystal, glass, porcelain and faience production began to develop. In the 19th century. in connection with the discovery and development of deposits of iron ore and coal and the construction of railways began the period of industrial capitalism, and mechanization and machinery began to play an increasingly important role. The construction of a large number of machine-building enterprises began.

 In the Russian Empire, machine building was poorly developed and almost all the complex machines were imported from abroad. This was the case in Ukraine.

First of all, the textile machinery industry (including the equipment of rope and spinning production) and the early enough technique of salty and soap dishes and candle products developed in Ukraine. Somewhat later (first of all in Volhynia) the technology of steel making, crystal, glass, porcelain and faience production began to develop. In the 19th century. in connection with the discovery and development of deposits of iron ore and coal and the construction of railways began the period of industrial capitalism, and mechanization and machinery began to play an increasingly important role. The construction of a large number of machine-building enterprises began.

 The development of technology in Ukraine in the modern sense (associated with the advent of machines and the mechanization of production processes) began at the end of the 18th century. It started from the machinery in textile industry (including the equipment of rope and spinning production). Later the technology of steel making, crystal, glass, porcelain and faience production began to develop, especially in Volyn. In the 19th century the discovery of deposits of iron ore and coal, and the construction of railways started off the period of industrial capitalism. Mechanization and machinery began to play an increasingly important role. The establishment of a large number of machine-building enterprises began.
 
-In the Russian Empire, machine building was poorly developed and almost all complex machines were imported from abroad. The same situation was in Ukraine.
-Foreigners built complex machinery here. Kandyba, Ya. Kozlovsky, I. Vasil'kov belong to pioneers of technology in 19th century. One of the areas of technology that reached a high level of development in Ukraine was the technique of road and bridge building (among others: the chain bridge over the Dnieper, built in 1847-1853 by the project of E. Vignel, the high bow gauge bridge and the tunnel near [[Yaremche|Yaremcha]] in the Carpathians, built 1898-1902 by Project Bizantz, Matakiewicz, etc.). Railways, the regulation of rivers flow, the construction of power stations in Kiev 1890 and in Kharkov 1897, urban transport technique ([[tram]]), the use of natural gas in municipal household, technology of extraction and refining of oil. Professits and engineers, graduates from [[Lviv Polytechnic]]s (founded in 1845), later Kharkiv (from 1883) and Kiev Polytechnic Institutes (since 1898)did here the best work.

<br>
The development of technology in the modern sense (it is associated with the advent of machines and with the mechanization of production processes) began in Ukraine from the end. [[18 centuries ]]. First of all, the textile machinery industry (including the equipment of rope and spinning production) and the early enough technique of salty and soap dishes and candle products developed in Ukraine. Somewhat later (first of all in Volhynia) the technology of steel making, crystal, glass, porcelain and faience production began to develop. In the 19th century. in connection with the discovery and development of deposits of iron ore and coal and the construction of railways began the period of industrial capitalism, and mechanization and machinery began to play an increasingly important role. The construction of a large number of machine-building enterprises began.
<br>
<br>
In the Russian Empire, machine building was poorly developed and almost all the complex machines were imported from abroad. This was the case in Ukraine. And here more sophisticated cars began to be built by strangers. Pioneers of technology from Ukrainians in the 19th century. belong D. Kandyba, Ya. Kozlovsky, I. Vasil'kov. To the areas of technology that have reached the highest level in Ukraine, we must first consider the technique of the structure of roads and bridges (among others a chain bridge over the Dnieper, built in [[1847]]-[[1853]] by the project of E. Vignel, a high bow gauge bridge and a tunnel near[[ Yaremcha ]] in the Carpathians, built [[1898]]-[[1902]] by Project Bizantz, Matakiewicz, etc.). Railways, regulation of the current year, the construction of power plants in Kiev [[(1890)]] and in Kharkov [[(1897)]], the technique of urban transport [[(tram]]), the use of natural gas in the utilities, oil extraction and [[refining]] technology. The professors and engineers, graduates of the[[ Lviv Polytechnic]] (founded in [[1845]]), and later Kharkiv (from [[1883]]) and the Kiev Polytechnic Institutes (since [[1898]]), made the most of this.
