In response, the parliament of Ukraine passed overwhelmingly approved the Act of Declaration. The Act was passed by 321 votes in favor, with 2 votes against, and 6 abstain. The author of the text was [[Levko Lukyanenko]].

"{{Politics of Ukraine}}
The '''Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine''' was adopted by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] on [[August 24]], [[1991]]. The Act established [[Ukraine]] as an independent, democratic state.  

The Act was adopted in the time when the conservative Communist leaders of the [[Soviet Union]] committed a [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup]] attempting to restore the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist party]] control over the country.  In response, the parliament of Ukraine passed overwhelmingly approved the Act of Declaration. The Act was passed by 321 votes in favor, with 2 votes against, and 6 abstain. The author of the text was [[Levko Lukyanenko]].

The declared independence of Ukraine was recognized by none of countries following the adoption of the Act by the parliament. The issue was passed into the hand of Ukrainian people, as the parliament called for a referendum on support of the Declaration of Independence.

In the [[Ukrainian referendum, 1991|referendum]] on [[December 1]], [[1991]], the people of Ukraine expressed widespread support for the Act of Declaration of Independence, with more than 90% votes in favor. Shortly after, the independence of Ukraine was recognized worldwide.

The '''Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine''' was adopted by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] on [[August 24]], [[1991]]. The Act established [[Ukraine]] as an independent, democratic state.  

The Act was adopted in the time when the conservative Communist leaders of the [[Soviet Union]] committed a [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup]] attempting to restore the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist party]] control over the country.  In response, the parliament of Ukraine passed overwhelmingly approved the Act of Declaration. The Act was passed by 321 votes in favor, with 2 votes against, and 6 abstain. The author of the text was [[Levko Lukyanenko]].

The declared independence of Ukraine was recognized by none of countries following the adoption of the Act by the parliament. The issue was passed into the hand of Ukrainian people, as the parliament called for a referendum on support of the Declaration of Independence.

In the [[Ukrainian referendum, 1991|referendum]] on [[December 1]], [[1991]], the people of Ukraine expressed widespread support for the Act of Declaration of Independence, with more than 90% votes in favor. Shortly after, the independence of Ukraine was recognized worldwide.

"{{Politics of Ukraine}}
The '''Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine''' was adopted by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] on [[August 24]], [[1991]]. The Act established [[Ukraine]] as an independent, democratic state.  

The Act was adopted in the time when the conservative Communist leaders of the [[Soviet Union]] committed a [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup]] attempting to restore the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist party]] control over the country.  In response, the parliament of Ukraine passed overwhelmingly approved the Act of Declaration. The Act was passed by 321 votes in favor, with 2 votes against, and 6 abstain. The author of the text was [[Levko Lukyanenko]].

The declared independence of Ukraine was recognized by none of countries following the adoption of the Act by the parliament. The issue was passed into the hand of Ukrainian people, as the parliament called for a referendum on support of the Declaration of Independence.

In the [[Ukrainian referendum, 1991|referendum]] on [[December 1]], [[1991]], the people of Ukraine expressed widespread support for the Act of Declaration of Independence, with more than 90% votes in favor. Shortly after, the independence of Ukraine was recognized worldwide.

"{{Politics of Ukraine}}
The '''Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine''' was adopted by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] on [[August 24]], [[1991]]. The Act established [[Ukraine]] as an independent, democratic state.  

The Act was adopted in the time when the conservative Communist leaders of the [[Soviet Union]] committed a [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup]] attempting to restore the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist party]] control over the country.  In response, the parliament of Ukraine passed overwhelmingly approved the Act of Declaration. The Act was passed by 321 votes in favor, with 2 votes against, and 6 abstain. The author of the text was [[Levko Lukyanenko]].

The declared independence of Ukraine was recognized by none of countries following the adoption of the Act by the parliament. The issue was passed into the hand of Ukrainian people, as the parliament called for a referendum on support of the Declaration of Independence.

In the [[Ukrainian referendum, 1991|referendum]] on [[December 1]], [[1991]], the people of Ukraine expressed widespread support for the Act of Declaration of Independence, with more than 90% votes in favor. Shortly after, the independence of Ukraine was recognized worldwide. 

==Act of Independence==
{{cquote|'''Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine'''
*In view of the mortal danger surrounding [[Ukraine]] in connection with the state coup in the [[USSR]] on [[August 19]], [[1991]],
*Continuing the thousand-year tradition of state development in [[Ukraine]],
*Proceeding from the right of a nation to self-determination in accordance with the Charter of the [[United Nations]] and other international legal documents, and
*Implementing the [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine]],
the [[Verkhovna Rada]] of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] solemnly declares
<br>'''Independence of Ukraine and creation of the independent Ukrainian state - UKRAINE'''.

The territory of Ukraine is indivisible and inviolable.

From this day forward, the [[Constitution of Ukraine|Constitution]] and laws of [[Ukraine]] only are valid on the territory of [[Ukraine]]. 

This act becomes effective at the moment of its approval.

The '''Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine''' was adopted by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] on [[August 24]], [[1991]]. The Act established [[Ukraine]] as an independent, democratic state.  

The Act was adopted in the time when the conservative Communist leaders of the [[Soviet Union]] committed a [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup]] attempting to restore the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist party]] control over the country.  In response, the parliament of Ukraine passed overwhelmingly approved the Act of Declaration. The Act was passed by 321 votes in favor, with 2 votes against, and 6 abstain. The author of the text was [[Levko Lukyanenko]].

The declared independence of Ukraine was recognized by none of countries following the adoption of the Act by the parliament. The issue was passed into the hand of Ukrainian people, as the parliament called for a referendum on support of the Declaration of Independence.

In the [[Ukrainian referendum, 1991|referendum]] on [[December 1]], [[1991]], the people of Ukraine expressed widespread support for the Act of Declaration of Independence, with more than 90% votes in favor. Shortly after, the independence of Ukraine was recognized worldwide.

In response, the parliament of Ukraine passed overwhelmingly approved the Act of Declaration. The Act was passed by 321 votes in favor, with 2 votes against, and 6 abstain.

The '''Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine''' was adopted by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] on [[August 24]], [[1991]]. The Act established [[Ukraine]] as an independent, democratic state.  

The Act was adopted in the time when the conservative Communist leaders of the [[Soviet Union]] committed a [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup]] attempting to restore the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist party]] control over the country.  In response, the parliament of Ukraine passed overwhelmingly approved the Act of Declaration. The Act was passed by 321 votes in favor, with 2 votes against, and 6 abstain. The author of the text was [[Levko Lukyanenko]].

The declared independence of Ukraine was recognized by none of countries following the adoption of the Act by the parliament. The issue was passed into the hand of Ukrainian people, as the parliament called for a referendum on support of the Declaration of Independence.

In the [[Ukrainian referendum, 1991|referendum]] on [[December 1]], [[1991]], the people of Ukraine expressed widespread support for the Act of Declaration of Independence, with more than 90% votes in favor. Shortly after, the independence of Ukraine was recognized worldwide.
