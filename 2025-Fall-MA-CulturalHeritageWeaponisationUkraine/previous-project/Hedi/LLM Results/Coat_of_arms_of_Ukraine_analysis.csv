-The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Riurikid]] dynasty. The oldest of those seals is the one of Prince [[Sviatoslav]] [[Igorevitch]], (deceased in 972). There is no sure and definite interpretation of the symbol, however, most historians agree that it most probably depicts a stylicised [[hawk]] or some other [[totem]] of the first Riurikid rulers's family. The use of this symbol has been supplanted since the 11th century by the Christian tradition of using the images of  the saints (most notably [[Saint George]] or [[Saint Michael]]) considered to be the protectors of the ruling family, and later by [[Galician]] or [[Cossack]] heraldic or cultural images. The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, M. V.

 The '''[[Coat of Arms]] of [[Ukraine]]''' features the same colours found on the [[Flag of Ukraine|Ukrainian flag]]: a blue [[shield]] with yellow [[trident]]&mdash;the symbol of ancient [[Slav]] tribes that once lived in Ukraine, later adopted by [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] and [[Kievan Rus]] rulers. 
 
 The coat of arms is a yellow trident with a blue background.
-The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Riurik]] dynasty. The oldest of those seals is the one of Prince [[Sviatoslav]] Ihorevych, (deceased in [[972]]). There is no sure and definite interpretation of the symbol, however, most historians agree that it most probably depicts a stylicised [[hawk]] or some other [[totem]] of the first Riurikid rulers's family. The use of this symbol has been supplanted since the 11th century by the Christian tradition of using the images of  the saints (most notably [[Saint George]] or [[Saint Michael]]) considered to be the protectors of the ruling family, and later by [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] or [[Cossack]] heraldic or cultural images. The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until [[1917]], when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (along other variants, including an [[arbalet]], a [[bow]] or a [[cossack]] carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for the Ukraine).

 The coat of arms is a yellow trident with a blue background.
-The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik]] dynasty. The oldest of those seals is the one of Prince [[Sviatoslav]] Ihorevych, (deceased in [[972]]).

The oldest of those seals is the one of Prince [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]] Ihorevych, (deceased in [[972]]).
 
 There is no sure and definite interpretation of the symbol, however, most historians agree that it most probably depicts a stylicised [[hawk]] or some other [[totem]] of the first Riurikid rulers's family. The use of this symbol has been supplanted since the 11th century by the Christian tradition of using the images of  the saints (most notably [[Saint George]] or [[Saint Michael]]) considered to be the protectors of the ruling family, and later by [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] or [[Cossack]] heraldic or cultural images. The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until [[1917]], when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (along other variants, including an [[arbalet]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a [[cossack]] carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine).

+The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik]] dynasty.  The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Volodymyr the Great]] (980–1015), might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Ihorovych]]) as a dynastic coat of arms and passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).
 
-There is no sure and definite interpretation of the symbol, however, most historians agree that it most probably depicts a stylized [[hawk]] or some other [[totem]] of the first Rurikid ruler's family. The use of this symbol has been supplanted since the 11th century by the Christian tradition of using the images of  the saints (most notably [[Saint George]] or [[Saint Michael]]) considered to be the protectors of the ruling family, and later by [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] or [[Cossack]] heraldic or cultural images. The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until [[1917]], when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalet]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a [[cossack]] carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). 
+The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kyiv]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure.  Almost 200 [[medieval]] variations of the tryzub have been discovered in [[Ukraine]].

The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik]] dynasty.  The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Volodymyr the Great]] (980–1015), might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Ihorovych]]) as a dynastic coat of arms and passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).
 
-The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kyiv]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure.  Almost 200 [[medieval]] variations of the tryzub have been discovered in [[Ukraine]].

-[[Image:Ruriks_crests1.png|thumb|200px|Personal crests of the [[Rurik Dynasty]]]]
-
-The coat of arms is a yellow trident with a blue background.
-The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik]] dynasty.  The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Volodymyr the Great]] (980–1015), might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Ihorovych]]) as a dynastic coat of arms and passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).
-
-The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kyiv]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure.  Almost 200 [[medieval]] variations of the tryzub have been discovered in [[Ukraine]].
-
-There is no sure and definite interpretation of the symbol, however, most historians agree that it most probably depicts a stylized [[hawk]] or some other [[totem]] of the first Rurikid ruler's family. The use of this symbol has been supplanted since the 11th century by the Christian tradition of using the images of  the saints (most notably [[Saint George]] or [[Saint Michael]]) considered to be the protectors of the ruling family, and later by [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] or [[Cossack]] heraldic or cultural images. The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until [[1917]], when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalet]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a [[cossack]] carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine).  On [[22 March]] [[1918]], the [[Central Rada]] adopted it as the coat of arms of the short lived [[Ukrainian National Republic]].

 The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik]] dynasty.  The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Volodymyr the Great]] (980–1015), might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Ihorovych]]) as a dynastic coat of arms and passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).

 The Great Coat of Arms of Ukraine was never officially adopted, but it was published in various heraldic sources. In this variant the shield is supported by a crowned lion from the [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] Coat of Arms on the left and a [[cossack]] in traditional dress, wielding a [[musket]], the symbol of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] on the right. The Coat of Arms is crowned with the crown of [[Volodymyr the Great]], symbolizing Ukrainian [[sovereignty]], and decorated with [[viburnum]] and wheat at the bottom. The official adoption of the Great Coat of Arms has to be endorsed by a majority by two thirds in the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]]. This has not yet been reached by this date (2008) because of the resistance of [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communists]] and pro-[[Russia]]n parties.

 The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik]] dynasty.  The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Volodymyr the Great]] (980–1015), might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Ihorovych]]) as a dynastic coat of arms and passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).
 
 The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kyiv]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure.  Almost 200 [[medieval]] variations of the tryzub have been discovered in [[Ukraine]].

-The Great Coat of Arms of Ukraine was never officially adopted, but it was published in various heraldic sources. In this variant the shield is supported by a crowned lion from the [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] Coat of Arms on the left and a [[cossack]] in traditional dress, wielding a [[musket]], the symbol of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] on the right. The Coat of Arms is crowned with the crown of [[Volodymyr the Great]], symbolizing Ukrainian [[sovereignty]], and decorated with [[viburnum]] and wheat at the bottom. The official adoption of the Great Coat of Arms has to be endorsed by a majority by two thirds in the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]]. This has not yet been reached by this date (2008) because of the resistance of [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communists]] and pro-[[Russia]]n parties.
+There is no sure and definite interpretation of the symbol, however, most historians agree that it most probably depicts a stylized [[hawk]] or some other [[totem]] of the first Rurikid ruler's family. The use of this symbol has been supplanted since the 11th century by the Christian tradition of using the images of the saints (most notably [[Saint George]] or [[Saint Michael]]) considered to be the protectors of the ruling family, and later by [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] or [[Cossack]] heraldic or cultural images.

-The ''tryzub'' was also used, in conjunction with the Russian [[Flag of Russia|tricolor]], as the symbol of the [[anti-communist]] movement [[National Alliance of Russian Solidarists]] in the early 20th century.
+The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalet]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a [[cossack]] carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On [[March 22]], [[1918]], the [[Central Rada]] adopted it as the coat of arms of the short lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].

 There is no sure and definite interpretation of the symbol, however, most historians agree that it most probably depicts a stylized [[hawk]] or some other [[totem]] of the first Rurikid ruler's family.

-The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik]] dynasty.  The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015), might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms and passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).

 The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure.  Almost 200 [[medieval]] variations of the tryzub have been discovered in [[Ukraine]].

 The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts.

 The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik]] dynasty. The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015), might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms and passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54). Another part of the theory is that it is derived from the trident of Poseidon, as Ukraine was first settled by the Greeks as early as 750-500 B.C.
 
 The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure.  Almost 200 [[medieval]] variations of the tryzub have been discovered in [[Ukraine]].

 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalet]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a [[cossack]] carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 22 March 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].

-The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik]] dynasty. The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015), might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms and passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54). Another part of the theory is that it is derived from the trident of Poseidon, as Ukraine was first settled by the Greeks as early as 750-500 B.C.

 The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure.  Almost 200 [[medieval]] variations of the tryzub have been discovered in [[Ukraine]].

**Analysis:** The revision includes the addition of links to the coat of arms of Ukraine in various languages, which reflects an effort to broaden the representation of Ukrainian cultural heritage. The removal of some links does not appear to target any specific narrative or perspective but rather seems to be an update to the article's language inclusivity.

**Conclusion:** Not Weaponised – The changes do not reflect a shift towards a narrative that weaponizes cultural heritage; instead, they enhance the representation of Ukrainian culture.",Not Weaponised

 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalet]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a [[cossack]] carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 22 March 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].

 The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure.  Almost 200 [[medieval]] variations of the tryzub have been discovered in [[Ukraine]].

-The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik]] dynasty. The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015), might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms and passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).

There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts.

 ==Interpretation==
 There is no sure and definite interpretation of the symbol; however, most historians agree that it most probably depicts a stylized [[falcon]] which according to the Slavic mythology was the Primary god (''Pershoboh'').<ref>[http://ukrlife.org/main/minerva/plachinda3.htm Serhiy Plachynda. ''The dictionary of Slavic mythology''.] {{uk icon}}</ref> In Christianity, a descending falcon, just as dove (with head downwards, as in case of Ukraine´s trident) also symbolizes the [[Holy Spirit]]. This is the most likely explanation, as the symbol appears during the years surrounding the Christianization, and is furthermore identical to modern representations of the descending falcon. Depictions of a flying falcon with a cross above its head have been found in [[Old Ladoga]], the first seat of Kievan [[Rurik dynasty]],<ref name=""chernov-trezin.narod.ru"">[http://chernov-trezin.narod.ru/GerbRurika.htm Coat of arms of Rurik found in Ladoga.] {{ru icon}}</ref> of Scandinavian lineage.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512996/Rurik Rurik (Norse leader)] Britannica Online Encyclopedia</ref>  Such falcon, along with a cross are also featured on the coins of [[Amlaíb mac Gofraid (died 941)|Olaf Guthfrithsson]], Viking konung.<ref name=""chernov-trezin.narod.ru""/> Falconry for centuries has been a royal sport in Europe. The [[Gyrfalcon]] (known also as ''Norwegian falcon'') was considered a royal bird and is mentioned (''ukr.: кречет'') in one of the earliest Ukraine´s epics, the 12th century [[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]. Being a highly prized hunting bird of Kings and Emperors in the Middle Ages, gyrfalcon is also the traditional symbol of Iceland, the land of Vikings. Every year, the Danish government sent a ship to Iceland to bring gyrfalcons. White [[gyrfalcon]] on a blue field was the Iceland's coat of arms from 1903 until 1919, being depicted on the Icelandic royal flag. The Order of the Falcon remains to be one of the highest presidential awards in Viking Iceland.<ref>[http://english.forseti.is/TheOrderoftheFalcon/ The Order of the Falcon.]</ref> It also features on the old Icelandic 5 krona banknote.<ref>[http://www.simnet.is/gardarj/birds/falcon.htm Virtual Iceland: Fálki - Gyrfalcon.]</ref> Due to its rarity and the difficulties involved in obtaining it, in European falconry the [[Gyrfalcon]] was reserved for kings and nobles; very rarely was a man of lesser rank seen with a Gyrfalcon on his fist.<ref>Berners, Juliana (1486): The Boke of St. Albans. St. Albans Press, London.</ref> Even nowadays, the market value of one gyrfalcon is estimated at 30,000 - 50,000 USD.<ref>[http://lenta.ru/news/2011/11/08/birds/ На Камчатке у браконьера изъяли вымирающих кречетов.] {{ru icon}}</ref> The descending ""trident"" form stands also for the hunting position of the gyrfalcon, as falling upon its prey. The interwoven spiral style of Ukraine trident (stylized flying falcon) resembles the [[Jelling style]], the Scandinavian animal art during the 10th century. The use of this symbol in Ukraine has been supplanted since the 11th century by the Christian tradition of using the images of the saints (most notably [[Saint George]] or [[Saint Michael]]) considered to be the protectors of the ruling family, and later by [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] or [[Cossack]] heraldic or cultural images.",/* History */ update,Aleksandr Grigoryev,2013-10-12T07:03:58Z,"Changed ""History"" to ""Origin"" in the section header.

 The Tryzub was also used, in conjunction with the Russian [[Flag of Russia|tricolor]], as the symbol of the [[anti-communist]] movement [[National Alliance of Russian Solidarists]] in the early 20th century. Furthermore the Tryzub is heavily used in the military heraldry of the [[Italian Army]] to commemorate the [[Italian participation in the Eastern Front|Italian participation]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War II]]. At least 36 units of the Italian Army carry the Tryzub in their [[Coat of Arms]], as they were awarded a [[Medal for Military Valor]] during their service on the territory of Ukraine.

 The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik]] dynasty. The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015), might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms and passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).
 
 The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure.  Almost 200 [[medieval]] variations of the tryzub have been discovered in [[Ukraine]].

 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalet]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a [[cossack]] carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 22 March 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].

 The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure.

The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik dynasty]]. The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015), might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms and passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).

 The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure.

This change could subtly influence the reader's understanding of the cultural significance of the symbol, potentially framing it in a way that emphasizes its historical roots and connections to Ukrainian identity.

 The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik dynasty]]. The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Volodymer the Great]] (980–1015), might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms and passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).
 
 The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure. Almost 200 [[medieval]] variations of the tryzub have been discovered in [[Ukraine]].

 ===From trident to falcon===
 There is no sure and definite interpretation of the symbol; however, most historians agree that it most probably depicts a stylized [[falcon]] which according to the Slavic mythology was the Primary god (''Pershoboh'').<ref>[http://ukrlife.org/main/minerva/plachinda3.htm Serhiy Plachynda. ''The dictionary of Slavic mythology''.] {{uk icon}}</ref> In Christianity, a descending falcon, just as dove (with head downwards, as in case of Ukraine´s trident) also symbolizes the [[Holy Spirit]].

 Cossack with musket was an emblem of the [[Zaporizhian Host]] and later the state emblem of Hetmanate and the [[Ukrainian State]]. The origin of emblem is uncertain, while its first records date back to 1592. On the initiative of [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]] the emblem was phased out and replaced with the Russian double-head eagle in 1767.
 The Cossack with rifle was recovered by the [[Hetman of Ukraine]] [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] in 1918. However later the emblem disappeared again until in 2005 it reappeared on the proposed Great Seal of Ukraine.

+==Ukrainian Soviet Socialistic Republic==
+The coat of arms of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was adopted on March 14, 1919 by the government of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and subsequently modified on November 7, 1928, January 30, 1937 and November 21, 1949. The coat of arms from 1949 is based on the coat of arms of the [[Soviet Union]] and features the [[hammer]] and [[sickle]], the [[red star]], a [[sunrise]] and stalks of wheat on its outer rims. The rising sun stands for the future of the Soviet Ukrainian nation, the star as well as the hammer and sickle for the victory of communism and the ""world-wide socialist community of states"".
+The banner bears the Soviet Union state motto (""Workers of the world, unite!"") in both the Ukrainian and Russian languages. The name of the Ukrainian SSR is shown only in Ukrainian.
+In 1992 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Ukraine became independent, the emblem was changed to the present coat of arms of Ukraine the tryzub (trident) coat of arms.

-The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik dynasty]]. The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Volodymer the Great]] (980–1015), might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms and passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).

 The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure. Almost 200 [[medieval]] variations of the tryzub have been discovered in [[Ukraine]].

-The history of the trident symbol as featured in the current Ukrainian coat of arms is more than 1000 years old. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik dynasty]]. The tryzub was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Volodymer the Great]] (980–1015), who might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms, and he passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).

-The tryzub was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts. Since the tryzub was so widely used, it evolved many variations without losing its basic structure. Almost 200 [[medieval]] variations of the tryzub have been discovered in [[Ukraine]].

-===From trident to falcon===
-There is no sure and definite interpretation of the symbol; however, most historians agree that it most probably depicts a stylized [[falcon]] which according to the Slavic mythology was the Primary god (''Pershoboh'').<ref>[http://ukrlife.org/main/minerva/plachinda3.htm Serhiy Plachynda. ''The dictionary of Slavic mythology''.] {{uk icon}}</ref> In Christianity, a descending falcon, just as dove (with head downwards, as in case of Ukraine´s trident) also symbolizes the [[Holy Spirit]]. This is the most likely explanation, as the symbol appears during the years surrounding the Christianization, and is furthermore identical to modern representations of the descending falcon.

Being a highly prized hunting bird of Kings and Emperors in the Middle Ages, the gyrfalcon is also the traditional symbol of Iceland, the land of Vikings. Every year, the Danish government sent a ship to Iceland to bring back gyrfalcons. A white [[gyrfalcon]] on a blue field was Iceland's coat of arms from 1903 until 1919, being depicted on the Icelandic royal flag.

The interwoven spiral style of the Ukraine trident (stylized flying falcon) resembles the [[Jelling style]], the Scandinavian animal art during the 10th century. The use of this symbol in Ukraine has been supplanted since the 11th century by the Christian tradition of using the images of the saints (most notably [[Saint George]] or [[Saint Michael]]) considered to be the protectors of the ruling family, and later by [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] or [[Cossack]] heraldic or cultural images.

 Later images of the trident (""tryzub"") among [[Rurikid]] resemble more a [[bident]] and letter ""Y"" which also in [[Cyrillic alphabet]] denotes sound ""u"" as in ""Ukraine"".

-The Tryzub was also used, in conjunction with the Russian [[Flag of Russia|tricolor]], as the symbol of the [[anti-communist]] movement [[National Alliance of Russian Solidarists]] in the early 20th century. Furthermore the Tryzub is heavily used in the military heraldry of the [[Italian Army]] to commemorate the [[Italian participation in the Eastern Front|Italian participation]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War II]]. At least 36 units of the Italian Army carry the Tryzub in their [[Coat of Arms]], as they were awarded a [[Medal for Military Valor]] during their service on the territory of Ukraine.

 A Cossack with a musket was an emblem of the [[Zaporizhian Host]] and later the state emblem of the Hetmanate and the [[Ukrainian State]]. The origin of the emblem is uncertain, while its first records date back to 1592. On the initiative of [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]] the emblem was phased out and replaced by the Russian double-headed eagle in 1767.
 
 A Cossack with a rifle was restored by the [[Hetman of Ukraine]] [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] in 1918. However later the emblem disappeared again until in 2005 it reappeared on the proposed Great Seal of Ukraine.

 Constitutional provisions exist for the establishment of a Great Coat of Arms of Ukraine,<ref>[[Constitution of Ukraine]], [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 20|Article 20]].</ref> although it was never officially adopted and was published in various heraldic sources. In this variant, the shield is supported by a lion from the [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] Coat of Arms on the left and a [[Cossack]] in traditional dress, wielding a [[musket]], the symbol of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] on the right. The Coat of Arms is crowned with the crown of [[Vladimir the Great]], symbolizing Ukrainian [[sovereignty]] and decorated with [[viburnum]] and wheat at the bottom.
 
 The official adoption of the Great Coat of Arms has to be endorsed by a majority of a two-thirds vote in the [[Verkhovna Rada]], the Ukrainian parliament.
 
 In 1917 [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] proposed the Great Coat of Arms in the form of a single shield topped by a dove with olive branch. The shield was split five ways. At its center there was a smaller shield depicting a [[plough]] as a symbol of productive peaceful work surrounded by state symbols of the old Ukraine: the princely arms of [[Vladimir the Great]] (tryzub), [[Pogoń Litewska|Litvin Pogon]] with a golden lion, [[cossack with musket]], the crossbow of Kiev and the lion of Lviv.

 ==Tryzub==
 The modern ""trident"" symbol was adopted as the coat of arms of the 
 [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in February 1918. The design has precedents in seals of the [[Kievan Rus]]. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the [[Rurik dynasty]]. It was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Volodymer the Great]] (980–1015), who might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms, and he passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).
-The symbol was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts.

 {{main|Coat of arms of Carpathian Ruthenia}}
 
 The coat of arms was created after the end of the [[First World War]], when Carpathian Ruthenia (then called Subcarpathian Rus') was transferred from [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]] to the newly created state of [[Czechoslovakia]]. It was designed in 1920 by [[Czechs|Czech]] historian [[Gustav Friedrich]]. The [[Rusyns|Ruthenians]] had been promised autonomy within the new country, and therefore a coat of arms was created for their land.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

 The coat of arms shows the Ukrainian tinctures (heraldic colours) of blue and gold in its first (dexter) field and a red bear on silver in its second field. The bear is perhaps a symbol of Carpathian wildlife. The horizontal lines (in heraldry called bars) could perhaps have been inspired by the partitions per fess in the coat of arms of Hungary, to which the territory had belonged.
 
 The arms were also used by the short-lived state of [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] in 1939, but with the addition of the Ukrainian trident in the uppermost blue field, used previously by the Ukrainian People's Republic. Since the territory is the same for the current [[Zakarpattia Oblast]], the oblast uses the arms as its own.",/* Carpathian Ruthenia */,Andrew J.Kurbiko,2014-11-24T11:54:20Z,"The change involves the addition of a new section that includes a table displaying the ""Emblem of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialistic Republic"" along with images of the coat of arms of Carpathian Ruthenia and the current Zakarpattia Oblast.

 A Cossack with a musket was an emblem of the [[Zaporizhian Host]] and later the state emblem of the Hetmanate and the [[Ukrainian State]]. The origin of the emblem is uncertain, while its first records date back to 1592. On the initiative of [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]] the emblem was phased out and replaced by the Russian double-headed eagle in 1767.
 
 A Cossack with a rifle was restored by the [[Hetman of Ukraine]] [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] in 1918. However, later the emblem disappeared again until in 2005 it reappeared on the proposed Great Seal of Ukraine.

 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalet]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a [[cossack]] carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 22 March 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].
 
-During the Soviet period of 1919-1991 the state symbols were consistent with the [[Russian SFSR]] and the [[Soviet Union]] - [[Sickle and Mallet]] over the rising sun.

 A Cossack with a musket was an emblem of the [[Zaporizhian Host]] and later the state emblem of the Hetmanate and the [[Ukrainian State]]. The origin of the emblem is uncertain, while its first records date back to 1592. On the initiative of [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]] the emblem was phased out and replaced by the Russian double-headed eagle in 1767.
 
-A Cossack with a rifle was restored by the [[Hetman of Ukraine]] [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] in 1918. However later the emblem disappeared again until in 2005 it reappeared on the proposed Great Seal of Ukraine.

 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalet]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a Kozak carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine).

+During the Soviet period of 1919-1991 the state symbols were consistent with the [[Russian SFSR]] and the [[Soviet Union]] - a [[hammer and sickle]] over the rising sun. The symbol is nearly identical with the Khazarian Tamga, a symbol used by Turkic-Mongoloid invaders of Ukraine who converted to Judaism in the 8-9th Century AD who established a autonomous empire. After its destruction by Slavic forces intent on reclaiming their old lands from Hunnic rule. The Khazarian Tamga is rumored to be the symbol of an aristocratic Khazarian family called the Kagan's. This recent evidence and archeological finds put into serious doubt the state symbols Ukrainian roots as it appears to be a Khazarian symbol.
 
 ==Tryzub==
 The modern ""trident"" symbol was adopted as the coat of arms of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in February 1918. The design has precedents in seals of the [[Kievan Rus'|Kiyivan Rus']]. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the [[Symbols of the Rurikids|seals]] of the [[Rurik dynasty]]. It was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Volodymer the Great|Volodymyr the Great]] (980–1015), who might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms, and he passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I|Svyatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).",,154.20.31.91,2015-05-24T03:10:44Z,"The change made is the addition of a paragraph that discusses the Khazarian Tamga, suggesting a connection between this symbol and the Ukrainian trident, while casting doubt on the Ukrainian roots of the trident symbol.

 The coat of arms of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was adopted on March 14, 1919 by the government of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and subsequently modified on November 7, 1928, January 30, 1937 and November 21, 1949. The coat of arms of 1949 is based on the coat of arms of the [[Soviet Union]] and features the [[hammer and sickle]], the [[red star]], a [[sunrise]] and ears of wheat on its outer rims. The rising sun stands for the future of the Soviet Ukrainian nation, the star as well as the hammer and sickle for the victory of communism and the ""world-wide socialist community of states"".
 The banner bears the Soviet Union state motto (""Workers of the world, unite!"") in both the Ukrainian and Russian languages. The name of the Ukrainian SSR is shown only in Ukrainian.
 In 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of Ukraine, the emblem was changed to the present coat of arms of Ukraine, the tryzub (trident) coat of arms.",[[WP:CHECKWIKI]] error fixes using [[Project:AWB|AWB]] (12054),Yobot,2016-07-18T08:49:07Z,"The change made in this revision is the rephrasing of the template tags from ""{{Main}}"" to ""{{Main article}}"" in several instances.

 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalet]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a Kozak carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 22 March 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].
 
 During the Soviet period of 1919-1991 the state symbols were consistent with the [[Russian SFSR]] and the [[Soviet Union]] - a [[hammer and sickle]] over the rising sun.

+The symbol is not of Ukrainian origin. The Symbol is more accurate called The Khazarian Tamga, after a group of Turko-Mongol raiders from the 700-800AD era who settle between the Black and Caspian sea north of the Caucuses, much of it in modern day Ukraine, who subsequently converted to Judaism and now make up the core of Ashkenazi Jewery. This was their official seal of the Khagante, or Kagans, which is Turko-Mongol language meaning King of Kings, Ghenghis Khan and Kubulai Khan where called Khagans. Many are wondering how a Slavic Nation like Ukraine would adopt a Judeo-Mongoloid symbol as its coat of arms, but it fits into the theory of Khazarian origin of Ashkenazi Jews, and a possible secret political movement to put Ukraine under Ashkenazi control, with Khazarian leaders, politicians, oligarchs, and even the President of Ukraine, Poroshenko, who's real name is Waltzmann and is from a long line of Khazarian Vors/thieves.

 The modern ""trident"" symbol was adopted as the coat of arms of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in February 1918. The design has precedents in seals of the [[Kievan Rus'|Kiyivan Rus']]. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the [[Symbols of the Rurikids|seals]] of the [[Rurik dynasty]]. It was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince [[Volodymer the Great|Volodymyr the Great]] (980–1015), who might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms, and he passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I|Svyatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).",,2001:569:BC08:1900:F80C:437C:D292:24B4,2016-01-31T03:58:04Z,"**Change Description:** Added a claim that the trident symbol is not of Ukrainian origin and is instead referred to as the Khazarian Tamga, along with a narrative linking it to Ashkenazi Jews and suggesting a political movement for control of Ukraine.

**Analysis:** The addition of this content introduces a narrative that undermines the legitimacy of the Ukrainian national symbol by attributing it to a historical group (Khazars) and linking it to a conspiracy theory regarding Ashkenazi control. This framing can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Ukrainian identity and heritage, which aligns with weaponisation tactics that seek to distort cultural narratives for political ends.

 The coat of arms shows the Ukrainian tinctures (heraldic colours) of blue and gold in its first (dexter) field and a red bear on silver in its second field. The bear is perhaps a symbol of Carpathian wildlife. The horizontal lines (in heraldry called bars) could perhaps have been inspired by the partitions per fess in the coat of arms of Hungary, to which the territory had belonged.
 
-The arms were also used by the short-lived state of [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] in 1939, but with the addition of the Ukrainian trident in the uppermost blue field, used previously by the Ukrainian People's Republic. Since the territory is the same for the current [[Zakarpattia Oblast]], the oblast uses the arms as its own.

The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the [[Symbols of the Rurikids|seals]] of the [[Rurik dynasty]]. It was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince Volodymyr the Great (980–1015), who might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms, and he passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I|Svyatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).
-The symbol was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev|Kiyiv]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces.

+The symbol was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kiev|Kiyiv]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts.

 A Cossack with a musket was an emblem of the [[Zaporizhian Host]] and later the state emblem of the Hetmanate and the [[Ukrainian State]]. The origin of the emblem is uncertain, while its first records date back to 1592. On the initiative of [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]] the emblem was phased out and replaced by the Russian double-headed eagle in 1767.
 
 A Cossack with a rifle was restored by the [[Hetman of Ukraine]] [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] in 1918. However, later the emblem disappeared again until in 2005 it reappeared on the proposed Great Seal of Ukraine.

 The coat of arms was created after the end of the [[First World War]], when Carpathian Ruthenia (then called Subcarpathian Rus') was transferred from [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]] to the newly created state of [[Czechoslovakia]]. It was designed in 1920 by [[Czechs|Czech]] historian [[Gustav Friedrich]]. The [[Rusyns|Ruthenians]] had been promised autonomy within the new country, and therefore a coat of arms was created for their land.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

 The coat of arms shows the Ukrainian tinctures (heraldic colours) of blue and gold in its first (dexter) field and a red bear on silver in its second field. The bear is perhaps a symbol of Carpathian wildlife. The horizontal lines (in heraldry called bars) could perhaps have been inspired by the partitions per fess in the coat of arms of Hungary, to which the territory had belonged.
 
 The arms were also used by the short-lived state of [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] in 1939, but with the addition of the Ukrainian Tryzub in the uppermost blue field, used previously by the Ukrainian People's Republic. Since the territory is the same for the current [[Zakarpattia Oblast]], the oblast uses the arms as its own.

The Great coat of arms which has not been adopted consists of the small coat of arms and the coat of arms of [[Zaporizhian Host]] ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], Article 20).
 
 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalest]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a cossack carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 25 February 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].
 
-During the Soviet period of 1919-1991 and independence between 1991-1992 the state symbols were consistent with the [[Russian SFSR]] and the [[Soviet Union]] - a [[hammer and sickle]] over the rising sun.

 ==Tryzub==
 The modern ""trident"" symbol was adopted as the coat of arms of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in February 1918. The design has precedents in seals of the [[Kievan Rus']]. The first known archeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the [[Symbols of the Rurikids|seals]] of the [[Rurik dynasty]]. It was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince Volodymyr the Great (980–1015), who might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms, and he passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I|Svyatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54).",,Anonymous from the 21st century,2019-04-27T19:21:21Z,"Changed the hyphen to an en dash in the phrase ""1919-1991"" to ""1919–1991"" and ""1991-1992"" to ""1991–1992"".

 The coat of arms for [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Kingdom of Ruthenia]] ({{lang-la|Regnum Russiæ}}) and [[Duchy of Galicia–Volhynia]] existed since 12th century. It consisted of [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] rampant Or on [[heater shield]] Azure. After the occupation of Eastern Galicia by the Kingdom of Poland as a result of the [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]], the coat of arms with many changes was adopted as part of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] ({{lang-la|Palatinatus russiae}}, Ruthenian Palatine). It was abandoned with [[partition of Poland]] and annexation of territory by the [[Austrian Empire]]. At the end of [[World War I]] and dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Western Ukrainian People's Republic]] revived the coat of arms. With annexation of the West Ukraine by Poland again in 1918 and later the [[Soviet Union]], the gold lion symbol became coat of arms for city of [[Lviv]].

+The small coat of arms was officially adopted on 19 February 1992, while [[Constitution of Ukraine|constitutional]] provisions exist for establishing the great coat of arms, which is not yet officially adopted. The small coat of arms was designed by [[Andriy Grechylo]], Oleksii Kokhan, and Ivan Turetskyi. It appears on the [[Flag of the President of Ukraine|Presidential Standard]] of Ukraine.

 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalest]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a cossack carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 25 February 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].

 Later images of the trident (""tryzub"") among the Rurikids resemble more a [[bident]] or the letter ""[[У]]"", which also in the modern [[Cyrillic alphabet]] denotes the sound ""u"" as in ""Ukraine"" (though the Cyrillic alphabet at the time did not have such a letter, using the digraph OѴ/Ѹ or its monogram Ꙋ instead).

-The Tryzub is heavily used in the military heraldry to commemorate the participation on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War II]]. At least 36 units of the Italian Army carry the Tryzub in their [[Coat of Arms]], as they were awarded a [[Medal for Military Valor]] during their service on the territory of Ukraine.

 The small coat of arms was officially adopted on 19 February 1992, while [[Constitution of Ukraine|constitutional]] provisions exist for establishing the great coat of arms, which is not yet officially adopted. The small coat of arms was designed by [[Andriy Grechylo]], Oleksii Kokhan, and Ivan Turetskyi. It appears on the [[Flag of the President of Ukraine|Presidential Standard]] of Ukraine. Blue-coloured tridents are considered to be an irregular representation by the [[Ukrainian Heraldry Society]]. The greater coat of arms which has not been adopted consists of the small coat of arms and the coat of arms of [[Zaporizhian Host]] ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], Article 20).
 
-The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalest]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a cossack carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 25 February 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].

 During the Soviet period of 1919–1991 and independence between 1991–1992, the state symbols were consistent with the [[Russian SFSR]] and the [[Soviet Union]] – a [[hammer and sickle]] over the rising sun.

 After the occupation of Eastern Galicia by the Kingdom of Poland as a result of the [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]], the coat of arms with many changes was adopted as part of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] ({{lang-la|Palatinatus russiae}}, Ruthenian Palatine). It was abandoned with [[partition of Poland]] and annexation of territory by the [[Austrian Empire]]. At the end of [[World War I]] and dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Western Ukrainian People's Republic]] revived the coat of arms. With the annexation of the West Ukraine by Poland again in 1918 and later the [[Soviet Union]], the gold lion symbol became the coat of arms for the city of [[Lviv]].

 The small coat of arms was officially adopted on 19 February 1992, while [[Constitution of Ukraine|constitutional]] provisions exist for establishing the great coat of arms, which is not yet officially adopted. The small coat of arms was designed by [[Andriy Grechylo]], Oleksii Kokhan, and Ivan Turetskyi. It appears on the [[Flag of the President of Ukraine|Presidential Standard]] of Ukraine. Blue-coloured tridents are considered to be an irregular representation by the [[Ukrainian Heraldry Society]]. The greater coat of arms which has not been adopted consists of the small coat of arms and the coat of arms of [[Zaporizhian Host]] ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], Article 20).
 
-The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky|Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]], proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalest]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a cossack carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 25 February 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].

-During the Soviet period of 1919–1991 and independence between 1991–1992, the state symbols were consistent with the [[Russian SFSR]] and the [[Soviet Union]] – a [[hammer and sickle]] over the rising sun.

 After the occupation of Eastern Galicia by the Kingdom of Poland as a result of the [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]], the coat of arms with many changes was adopted as part of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] ({{lang-la|Palatinatus russiae}}, Ruthenian Palatine). It was abandoned with [[partition of Poland]] and annexation of territory by the [[Austrian Empire]]. At the end of [[World War I]] and dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Western Ukrainian People's Republic]] revived the coat of arms. With the annexation of the West Ukraine by Poland again in 1918 and later the [[Soviet Union]], the gold lion symbol became the coat of arms for the city of [[Lviv]].

 The symbol was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kyiv]], the tiles of the [[Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr (city)|Volodymyr]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces.

 The coat of arms shows the Ukrainian tinctures (heraldic colours) of blue and gold in its first (dexter) field and a red bear on silver in its second field. The bear is perhaps a symbol of Carpathian wildlife. The horizontal lines (in heraldry called bars) could perhaps have been inspired by the partitions per fess in the coat of arms of Hungary, to which the territory had belonged.
 
-The arms were also used by the short-lived state of [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] in 1939, but with the addition of the Ukrainian Tryzub in the uppermost blue field, used previously by the Ukrainian People's Republic.

Officially referred to as the '''Princely State Symbol of Volodymyr the Great''', or, colloquially, the '''''tryzub''''' ({{lang-uk|Тризуб}}), the insignia derives from the [[Symbols of the Rurikids|seal-trident]] of [[Vladimir the Great|Volodymyr]], the first [[Grand Prince of Kiev|Grand Prince of Kyiv]]. 
 
-Volya (Воля) is the Ukrainian word for “freedom” and these Cyrillic  letters form the trident (the ""В"" on the left, the ""о"" and ""л"" in the centre, and the ""я"" on the right).
-
 The small coat of arms was officially adopted on 19 February 1992, while [[Constitution of Ukraine|constitutional]] provisions exist for establishing the great coat of arms, which is not yet officially adopted. The small coat of arms was designed by [[Andriy Grechylo]], Oleksii Kokhan, and Ivan Turetskyi. It appears on the [[Flag of the President of Ukraine|Presidential Standard]] of Ukraine. Blue-coloured tridents are considered to be an irregular representation by the [[Ukrainian Heraldry Society]]. The greater coat of arms which has not been adopted consists of the small coat of arms and the coat of arms of [[Zaporozhian Host]] ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], Article 20).
 
 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]i, proposed to adopt it as a [[National symbols of Ukraine|national symbol]] (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalest]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a cossack carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 25 February 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].","unsourced, unlikely, and absent from other lang versions",82.166.199.42,2022-03-10T15:13:07Z,"Removed the sentence explaining the meaning of ""Volya"" in relation to the trident symbol.

On its obverse, there is an image of a monarch on a throne, and on the reverse, an armed horseman holding a shield with a lion on his hind legs. On the seal, there is an inscription in Latin: ""Sigillum Domini Georgi Regis Rusie"" (Seal of the owner of George-Yuri, King of Ruthenia), on the back: ""Sigillum Domini Georgi Ducis Ladimerie"" (seal of the owner of George-Yuri, prince of Lodomeria).
 
 On the seal of his son [[Leo I of Galicia|Lev II]], only a lion without a rider is depicted; the animal stands on its hind legs and reverses to the left.
 
-Figures of lions as symbols of Ruthenia are found on the silver coins of the Lithuanian prince Lubart, the last ruler of the Kingdom of Ruthenia (1340-1383), and his son Fedor (1384-1387). We see the same motive on Ruthenian money, the issue of which continued during the reign in Ruthenia of the Polish king Casimir III (1349-1370), the Hungarian king Louis (1370-1372, 1378–1382) and his governor, Prince of Opolsk Vladislav (1372–1378).

 After the occupation of Eastern Galicia by the Kingdom of Poland as a result of the [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]], the coat of arms with many changes was adopted as part of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] ({{lang-la|Palatinatus russiae}}, Ruthenian Palatine). It was abandoned with [[partition of Poland]] and annexation of territory by the [[Austrian Empire]]. At the end of [[World War I]] and dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Western Ukrainian People's Republic]] revived the coat of arms. With the annexation of the West Ukraine by Poland again in 1918 and later the [[Soviet Union]], the gold lion symbol became the coat of arms for the city of [[Lviv]].

 The small coat of arms was officially adopted on 19 February 1992, while [[Constitution of Ukraine|constitutional]] provisions exist for establishing the great coat of arms, which is not yet officially adopted. The small coat of arms was designed by [[Andriy Grechylo]], Oleksii Kokhan, and Ivan Turetskyi. It appears on the [[Flag of the President of Ukraine|Presidential Standard]] of Ukraine. Blue-coloured tridents are considered to be an irregular representation by the [[Ukrainian Heraldry Society]]. The greater coat of arms which has not been adopted consists of the small coat of arms and the coat of arms of [[Zaporozhian Host]] ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], Article 20).

 After the occupation of Eastern Galicia by the Kingdom of Poland as a result of the [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]], the coat of arms with many changes was adopted as part of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] ({{lang-la|Palatinatus russiae}}, Ruthenian Palatine). It was abandoned with [[partition of Poland]] and annexation of territory by the [[Austrian Empire]]. At the end of [[World War I]] and dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Western Ukrainian People's Republic]] revived the coat of arms. With the annexation of the West Ukraine by Poland again in 1918 and later the [[Soviet Union]], the gold lion symbol became the coat of arms for the city of [[Lviv]].

At least 36 units of the Italian Army carry the Tryzub in their [[Coat of Arms]], as they were awarded a [[Medal for Military Valor]] during their service on the territory of Ukraine. The Tryzyb is the Coat of arms of [[Zaslawye]].  Worth noting is that the Tryzub was also used in conjunction with the Russian [[Flag of Russia|tricolour]], as the symbol of the [[anti-communist]] movement [[National Alliance of Russian Solidarists]] in the early 20th century.
 
-The tryzub of Ukraine may also be interpreted to incorporate the word '''воля''' (volya), which means ""freedom"". '''В''' (v) is the left ""tooth"", '''О''' (o) is the bottom, '''Л''' (l) is the top, and '''Я''' (ya) is the right ""tooth"".

+The modern ""trident"" symbol was adopted as the coat of arms of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in February 1918, designed by [[Vasyl Krychevsky]]. The design has precedents in seals of the [[Kyivan Rus]]. The first known archaeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on [[Symbols of the Rurikids|the seals]] of the [[Rurik dynasty]]. However, according to [[Omeljan Pritsak|Pritsak]], the stylized trident [[tamga]], or seal which was used by Rus rulers such as [[Sviatoslav I|Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] and [[Symbols of the Rurikids#Origins |similar tamgas]] that were found in ruins are [[Khazar]] in origin.<ref>Brook 154</ref><ref>Franklin & Shepard 120–21</ref><ref>Pritsak, ''Weights'' 78–79.</ref> 
 
 It was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince Volodymyr the Great (980–1015), who might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatoslav I Igorevich]]) as a dynastic coat of arms, and he passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I|Svyatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54). The symbol was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kyiv]], the tiles of the [[Dormition of the Mother of God|Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr (city)|Volodymyr]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts.

+'''Designs of the coat of arms of Ukraine by Heorhiy Narbut''' are projects of the State Coat of Arms of the [[Ukrainian State]] and the Great Coat of Arms of the Ukrainian State developed by the Ukrainian artist [[Heorhiy Narbut]] in 1918. Heorhiy Narbut took as a basis the national symbols of the hetman state of the Zaporizhzhya Army. On an octagonal blue shield, a Cossack dressed in gold ornamented robes was placed in the center.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Гуменюк |first=Тетяна Костянтинівна |date=2021-06-25 |title=ХОРЕОЛОГІЯ У ПРОСТОРІ СУЧАСНОГО МИСТЕЦТВОЗНАВСТВА |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.31866/2410-1176.44.2021.235447 |journal=Вісник КНУКіМ.

The [[Cossacks|Cossack]] was turned to the right, and around his shield was a silver cantush, painted in a floral baroque style.

George Narbut used baroque elements and heraldic signs - the trident and coat of arms of the Kyiv Magistrate of the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the form of a crossbow. So the trident became a popular symbol and eventually turned into a small coat of arms of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Since January 22, 1919, the Trident was also used as the coat of arms of the Western region of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. It remained the coat of arms of the hetman state of [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]], as well as the [[Directorate of Ukraine]].
 
 ===Grand Duchy of Ruthenia (Archistrategos Mykhaïl)===
 The importance of the Kyiv region coat of arms with [[Archangel Michael]] known as Archistrategos Mykhaïl arose during discussion of the so-called 1658 Hadiach Treaty between the delegation of the Cossack Hetmanate and the Crown of Poland, that foresaw the transformation of the Commonwealth into the [[Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth]].

**Analysis:** The revision focuses on the presentation of coat of arms proposals, emphasizing the importance of original depictions over generic styles. The user’s comment suggests a preference for authenticity in cultural representations, which aligns with a protective stance towards Ukrainian cultural heritage. However, the change itself does not introduce any overtly weaponized language or narratives.

At least 36 units of the Italian Army carry the Tryzub in their [[Coat of Arms]], as they were awarded a [[Medal for Military Valor]] during their service on the territory of Ukraine. The Tryzub is the Coat of arms of [[Zaslawye]].  Worth noting is that the Tryzub was also used in conjunction with the Russian [[Flag of Russia|tricolour]], as the symbol of the [[anti-communist]] movement [[National Alliance of Russian Solidarists]] in the early 20th century.

 The modern ""trident"" symbol was adopted as the coat of arms of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in February 1918, designed by [[Vasyl Krychevsky]]. The design has precedents in seals of the [[Kyivan Rus]]. The first known archaeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on [[Symbols of the Rurikids|the seals]] of the [[Rurik dynasty]]. However, according to [[Omeljan Pritsak|Pritsak]], the stylized trident [[tamga]], or seal which was used by Rus rulers such as [[Sviatoslav I]] and [[Symbols of the Rurikids#Origins |similar tamgas]] that were found in ruins are [[Khazar]] in origin.<ref>Brook 154</ref><ref>Franklin & Shepard 120–21</ref><ref>Pritsak, ''Weights'' 78–79.</ref> 
 
 It was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince Volodymyr the Great (980–1015), who might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I]]) as a dynastic coat of arms, and he passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54). The symbol was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kyiv]], the tiles of the [[Dormition of the Mother of God|Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr (city)|Volodymyr]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts.

 The modern ""trident"" symbol was adopted as the coat of arms of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in February 1918, designed by [[Vasyl Krychevsky]]. The design has precedents in seals of the [[Kyivan Rus]]. The first known archaeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on [[Symbols of the Rurikids|the seals]] of the [[Rurik dynasty]]. However, according to [[Omeljan Pritsak|Pritsak]], the stylized trident [[tamga]], or seal which was used by Rus rulers such as [[Sviatoslav I]] and [[Symbols of the Rurikids#Origins |similar tamgas]] that were found in ruins are [[Khazar]] in origin.<ref>Brook 154</ref><ref>Franklin & Shepard 120–21</ref><ref>Pritsak, ''Weights'' 78–79.</ref> 
 
 It was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince Volodymyr the Great (980–1015), who might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I]]) as a dynastic coat of arms, and he passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54). The symbol was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kyiv]], the tiles of the [[Dormition of the Mother of God|Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr (city)|Volodymyr]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces.

 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]i, proposed to adopt it as a [[National symbols of Ukraine|national symbol]] (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalest]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a cossack carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 25 February 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].

On an octagonal blue shield, a Cossack dressed in gold ornamented robes was placed in the center.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Гуменюк |first=Тетяна Костянтинівна |date=2021-06-25 |title=ХОРЕОЛОГІЯ У ПРОСТОРІ СУЧАСНОГО МИСТЕЦТВОЗНАВСТВА |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.31866/2410-1176.44.2021.235447 |journal=Вісник КНУКіМ.

The [[Cossacks|Cossack]] was turned to the right, and around his shield was a silver cantush, painted in a floral baroque style. The trident gained popularity in the Ukrainian People's Republic, because it was depicted on the ruble coins introduced in December 1917.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=РУМ’ЯНЦЕВ |first=ВЯЧЕСЛАВ |date=2020 |title=Витоки, природа влади та правові засади Української держави гетьмана Павла Скоропадського |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.33498/louu-2020-01-225 |journal=Право України |issue=2020/01 |pages=225 |doi=10.33498/louu-2020-01-225 |s2cid=214314690 |issn=2310-323X}}</ref> The first coin of the Ukrainian People's Republic was 100 rubles. George Narbut used baroque elements and heraldic signs - the trident and coat of arms of the Kyiv Magistrate of the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the form of a crossbow. So the trident became a popular symbol and eventually turned into a small coat of arms of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Since January 22, 1919, the Trident was also used as the coat of arms of the Western region of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. It remained the coat of arms of the hetman state of [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]], as well as the [[Directorate of Ukraine]].
 
 ===Grand Duchy of Ruthenia (Archistrategos Mykhaïl)===
-The importance of the Kyiv region coat of arms with [[Archangel Michael]] known as Archistrategos Mykhaïl arose during discussion of the so-called 1658 [[treaty of Hadiach]] between the delegation of the Cossack Hetmanate and the Crown of Poland, that foresaw the transformation of the Commonwealth into the [[Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth]]. The coat of arms with Archangel Michael is often confused with symbol of the Kyiv City. Please note that before the Muscovite annexation of Ukrainian lands in 18th century (see ""[[partitions of Poland]]""), the city had another symbol which was included by [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] in his proposal of the Ukrainian coat of arms.

 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]i, proposed to adopt it as a [[National symbols of Ukraine|national symbol]] (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalest]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a cossack carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 25 February 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].

The greater coat of arms which has not been adopted consists of the small coat of arms and the coat of arms of [[Cossack Hetmanate|Zaporizhian Host]] ([[Constitution of Ukraine]], Article 20).
 
 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]i, proposed to adopt it as a [[National symbols of Ukraine|national symbol]] (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalest]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a cossack carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 25 February 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].
 
 During the Soviet period of 1919–1991 and independence between 1991 and 1992, the state symbols were consistent with the [[Russian SFSR]] and the [[Soviet Union]] – a [[hammer and sickle]] over the rising sun.

 Falconry has been a royal sport in Europe for centuries. The [[gyrfalcon]] (known also as ''Norwegian falcon'') was considered a royal bird and is mentioned (''ukr.: рарог'') in one of the earliest epics of Ruthenia, the 12th century poem [[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|The Tale of Ihor's Campaign]].

 The coat of arms shows the Ukrainian tinctures (heraldic colours) of blue and gold in its first (dexter) field and a red bear on silver in its second field. The bear is perhaps a symbol of Carpathian wildlife. The horizontal lines (in heraldry called bars) could perhaps have been inspired by the partitions per fess in the coat of arms of Hungary, to which the territory had belonged.

 ===Grand Duchy of Ruthenia (Archistrategos Mykhaïl)===
 The importance of the Kyiv region coat of arms with [[Archangel Michael]] known as Archistrategos Mykhaïl arose during discussion of the so-called 1658 [[treaty of Hadiach]] between the delegation of the Cossack Hetmanate and the Crown of Poland, that foresaw the transformation of the Commonwealth into the [[Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth]]. The coat of arms with Archangel Michael is often confused with symbol of the Kyiv City.

 ===Grand Duchy of Ruthenia (Archistrategos Mykhaïl)===
 The importance of the Kyiv region coat of arms with [[Archangel Michael]] known as Archistrategos Mykhaïl arose during discussion of the so-called 1658 [[treaty of Hadiach]] between the delegation of the Cossack Hetmanate and the Crown of Poland, that foresaw the transformation of the Commonwealth into the [[Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth]]. The coat of arms with Archangel Michael is often confused with symbol of the Kyiv City. Note that before the Muscovite annexation of Ukrainian lands in 18th century (see ""[[partitions of Poland]]""), the city had another symbol which was included by [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] in his proposal of the Ukrainian coat of arms.","/* Designs by Heorhiy Narbut */ fixed name of the currency, UPR had its own currency",188.163.104.38,2023-11-10T09:08:46Z,"Changed the term ""ruble"" to ""karbovanets"" in the context of the Ukrainian People's Republic's currency.

 It was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince Volodymyr the Great (980–1015), who might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I]]) as a dynastic coat of arms, and he passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54). The symbol was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kyiv]], the tiles of the [[Dormition of the Mother of God|Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr (city)|Volodymyr]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces.

 It was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Prince Volodymyr the Great (980–1015), who might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I]]) as a dynastic coat of arms, and he passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–19) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54). The symbol was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kyiv]], the tiles of the [[Dormition of the Mother of God|Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr (city)|Volodymyr]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces.

 The importance of the Kyiv region coat of arms with [[Archangel Michael]] known as Archistrategos Mykhaïl arose during discussion of the so-called 1658 [[treaty of Hadiach]] between the delegation of the Cossack Hetmanate and the Crown of Poland, that foresaw the transformation of the Commonwealth into the [[Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth]]. The coat of arms with Archangel Michael is often confused with symbol of the Kyiv City. Note that before the Muscovite annexation of Ukrainian lands in 18th century (see ""[[partitions of Poland]]""), the city had another symbol which was included by [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] in his proposal of the Ukrainian coat of arms.

 After the occupation of Eastern Galicia by the Kingdom of Poland as a result of the [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]], the coat of arms with many changes was adopted as part of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] ({{lang-la|Palatinatus russiae}}, Ruthenian Palatine).

 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]i, proposed to adopt it as a [[National symbols of Ukraine|national symbol]] (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalest]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a cossack carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 25 February 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].
 
 During the Soviet period of 1919–1991 and independence between 1991 and 1992, the state symbols were consistent with the [[Russian SFSR]] and the [[Soviet Union]] – a [[hammer and sickle]] over the rising sun.

 The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]i, proposed to adopt it as a [[National symbols of Ukraine|national symbol]] (alongside other variants, including an [[arbalest]], a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] or a cossack carrying a [[musket]], i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 25 February 1918, the [[Central Rada]] (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].

-The modern ""trident"" symbol was adopted as the coat of arms of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in February 1918, designed by [[Vasyl Krychevsky]].

 It was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by [[Vladimir the Great]] ({{reigned|980|1015}}), also known as Volodymyr, who might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as [[Sviatoslav I]]) as a dynastic coat of arms, and he passed it on to his sons, [[Sviatopolk I]] (1015–1019) and [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–54). The symbol was also found on the bricks of the [[Church of the Tithes]] in [[Kyiv]], the tiles of the [[Dormition of the Mother of God|Dormition]] Cathedral in [[Volodymyr (city)|Volodymyr]], and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts.

 Falconry has been a royal sport in Europe for centuries. The [[gyrfalcon]] (known also as ''Norwegian falcon'') was considered a royal bird and is mentioned (''ukr.: рарог'') in one of the earliest epics of [[Ruthenia]], the 12th century poem [[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]].
 
 Later images of the trident (""tryzub"") among the Rurikids resemble more a [[bident]] or the letter ""[[У]]"", which also in the modern [[Cyrillic alphabet]] denotes the sound ""u"" as in ""Ukraine"" (though the Cyrillic alphabet at the time did not use this letter individually, using the digraph ОУ/ОѴ or its monogram Ꙋ instead).

**Analysis:** The addition of the coat of arms images emphasizes Ukrainian national symbols, which can be seen as reinforcing a narrative of cultural identity. The rearrangement of the ""See also"" section to highlight these symbols further aligns with a perspective that promotes Ukrainian heritage.

**Conclusion:** Weaponised. The changes subtly enhance the visibility of Ukrainian cultural symbols, which can be interpreted as a strategic reinforcement of national identity in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.",Weaponised
