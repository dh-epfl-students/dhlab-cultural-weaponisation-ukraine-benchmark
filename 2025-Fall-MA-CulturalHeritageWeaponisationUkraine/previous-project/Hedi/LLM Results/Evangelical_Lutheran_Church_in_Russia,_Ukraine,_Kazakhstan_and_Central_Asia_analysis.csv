==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople.

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R.

By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R.

By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R.

By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

 The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}), in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'', heavily influenced by [[Pietism]], had been in existence since the 19th century but had managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to their fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches, but they were in most cases unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />
 
 The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia]] registered in 1940 and the [[Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in 1949, although they, too, were targets of repression and controls.<ref name=""Stricker"" />

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R.

By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

 As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]], with their large Lutheran populations, were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]].<ref name=""GRHS"" /> [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia.<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />

 With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented.

 The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}), in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'', heavily influenced by [[Pietism]], had been in existence since the 19th century but had managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to their fluid structure.

==History==

Lutheranism had established itself in the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic states]] of the [[Baltics]] and [[Ingria]] in the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]<ref name=""Stricker"" />. [[Ivan the Terrible]] invited German artisans and professionals to help modernize Russian institutions, bringing Lutherans into Russia proper.

===Early history===
The first church consecrated for Lutheran use in [[Moscow]], [[St. Michael's Lutheran Church, Moscow|St. Michael's Church]], was completed in 1576<ref name='GRHS'>{{cite web | url = http://www.grhs.org/heritage/lutheran-churches_drefs.pdf | title = The Lutheran Church in Russia, with special emphasis on Ukraine: Intertwined with the history of Russia | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | last = Drefs | first = R. Rueben | work = Heritage Review | publisher = Germans from Russia Heritage Society}}</ref>. By the end of the 17th century, German Lutherans were spread throughout Russia, primarily among the military garrisons<ref name=""GRHS"" /><ref name='EWCR-Sorokina'>{{cite journal | title = Lutherans in Russia | journal = East-West Church & Ministry Report | date = 2003 | first = Valeria | last = Sorokina | volume = 11 | issue = 2| id =   | url = http://www.eastwestreport.org/articles/ew11203.html | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

As a result of the [[Great Northern War]], the former [[Sweden|Swedish]] provinces of [[Livonia]] and [[Estonia]] with their large Lutheran populations were ceded to Russia. To gain the support of the Baltic nobility, the Lutheran churches were granted freedom of dogma, liturgy and administration by [[Peter the Great]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />. [[Catherine the Great]]'s policy of populating frontier areas of the Russian Empire with immigrants further increased the number of German Lutherans in Russia<ref name=""GRHS"" /> <ref name='EWCR-Sorokina' />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.

Despite the de-facto recognition of Lutheranism in Russia, it was still considered a foreign faith with restrictions on proseltytization placed to limit the expansion of the faith to non-Russian nationalities only<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />, with secular oversight being placed under the Main Administration for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Foreign Faiths<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Official establishment===

In 1832, de-jure recognition was granted to the Lutheran Church and the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia''' (ELCR) ({{lang-de|Evangelisch Lutherische Kirche in Russland}}) was established uniting Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] congregations<ref name='KALME-ELCROS-2'>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalme.net/kurzgeschichte-ru.html?L=0 | title = Die Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Russland, der Ukraine, in Kasachstan und Mittelasien: Kurzgeschichte | accessdate = 2011-12-17 | publisher = Communication Committee of Lutheran Minority Churches in Europe | language = German}}</ref> in three administrative regions; Russia proper, [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]<ref name=""GRHS"" /> with the [[Czar of Russia|Czar]] as the Supreme Bishop<ref name=""Stricker"" />. The ELCR was granted the status of a [[State Church]] for minorities whose properties and leadership would be funded and salaried by the state<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1905, full religious freedom was granted with an [[Edict of toleration]] and Lutheran churches were finally allowed to conduct services and their liturgy in the [[Russian language]]. By 1914, the Lutheran church in Russia proper itself had grown to include 1,828 congregations comprising 3,660,000 members of various nationalities<ref name='Stricker-2'>{{cite journal | title = The Problems of Theological Education: The Experience of Lutheran Institutions in the CIS. | journal = Religion in Eastern Europe | date = 2001 | first = Stricker | last = Gerd | volume = 21 | pages = 1-19| id =   | url = http://www.georgefox.edu/academics/undergrad/departments/soc-swk/ree/Stricker_The%20Problems_June%202001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

===The First World War and the early Soviet era===

With Russia's joining of the [[First World War]] on the side of [[Triple Entente]] against the [[German Empire]], a policy of mass deportation of the German minorities in Russia was implemented. As a significant number of Russia's Lutherans were German or German speaking, this severely effected the Lutheran church<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918 also brought tremendous changes to the Lutheran church. The former Russian territories of [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Poland]] with large Lutheran populations gained independence<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. In December 1917, control of schools and seminaries were nationalized and by 1918, this extended to all properties of the church, including church buildings. By 1921, religious instruction to persons under the age of 18 was banned<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

The deportation policies of the Tsarist era was continued in some areas encouraged by the participation of whole German speaking communities on the side of the [[White movement|White Russians]] against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

In 1924, the remaining clergy of the ELCR met in a General Synod in Moscow to re-organise the church. The re-organised ELCR was put under the supervision of two elected bishops, [[Artur Malmgren]] of Leningrad and [[Theophil Meyer]] of Moscow. Despite the state approval of a new constitution for the Lutheran church in 1924 by the new Bolshevik government, the [[Collective farming|collectivization]] policies of [[Stalin]] in 1928 scattered the population and official anti-religion campaigns intensified in the 1930s under the authority of the 1929 Law on Religion resulting in the incarceration of pastors in deportation camps and in some cases, their executions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" /><ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />.

In 1936, Bishop Malmgren had left Russia for Germany, and by 1937, the ELCR had ceased to exist as an organized body<ref name=""GRHS"" />.

===Second World War and the post war period===

The Second World War brought another upheaval to the Lutheran communities. Mass deportations of German from European Russia to Soviet Asia and Siberia occurred prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Russia]] had the nett result of decimating religious life among the German peaking Lutherans as no religious services were allowed in the deportation regions<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. The only exception was a Lutheran church in [[Astana|Tselinograd]] that was established by [[Eugen Bachmann]] in 1957 and granted registration in 1957<ref name='Matchett'>{{cite journal | title = German Lutherans in the Soviet Union | journal = Religion in Communist Lands | date = 1973 | first = Matchett | last = Kathleen | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 13-16| id = | url = http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rcl/01-6_13.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-17}}</ref>.

The remaining Lutherans survived the collapse of the ELCR by joining existing ''Brethren communities'' ({{lang-de|Bruedergemeinden}}) in which leadership and pastoral care was given by laypeople. Such ''Brethren communities'' were heavily influenced by [[Pietism]] and have been in existence since the 19th century but have managed to survive the persecutions of the Soviet state due to its fluid structure. In 1955, three ELCR pastors who had survived the concentration camps and deportations visited the underground ''Brethren congregations'' in the deportation regions in attempts to regularize the administration of the churches but were in most cases, unsuccessful<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />

The Soviet annexation of the [[Baltic states]] in 1944 also brought back a significant Lutheran population and the various Lutheran Churches that were established in these territories were allowed to function although they too were target of repression and controls<ref name=""Stricker"" />.

It was only in the post-Stalin era in the 1960s that Lutheran congregations in the deportation areas were finally allowed to register with the first two being registered in [[Siberia]] in 1965<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. The Rev [[Harald Kalnins]] from [[Riga]], sponsored by the [[Lutheran World Federation]], was granted permission to visit them periodically<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />.

===Late Soviet and immediate post-Soviet era===

In 1980, Kalnins was recognised as the superintendent of the German Lutherans in the Soviet Union<ref name=""Stricker"" /> and with the advent of [[Perestroika]] in the Soviet Union, officially installed as the Bishop in 1988 of the re-organised '''German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Soviet Union'''<ref name=""Stricker-2"" />. This allowed the re-organising of congregations and formal seminary training.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the church became known as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia and the Other States''' and between 1992 to 1994, [[synod]]s were organised in European Russia, Siberia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />. In 1994, the first General Synod was held in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Georg Kretschmar]] was elected to succeed Kalnins as bishop. At the second General Synod in 1999, the title of the Bishop was changed to Archbishop<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />.

===Contemporary developments===

With the passing of the 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations in Russia, the Church was again re-registered in 1999 as the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia'''<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS-2"" />. Despite the German origin of the Lutheran church in Russia, the demographics have shifted to include an increasing number of other nationalities with reports of up to 30% of the members in Central Asia being made up of [[Russian people|Russian]]s<ref name=""EWCR-Sorokina"" />. A new seminary was also established in 1997 in [[Novosaratovka]] near St. Petersburg.

==Structure==

The main governing body of ELCROS is the General Synod and the church is divided into seven regional Lutheran denominations in Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan as well as individual congregations in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan<ref name=""KALME-ELCROS"" />.
