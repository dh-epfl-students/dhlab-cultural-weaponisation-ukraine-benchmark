-[[Ukraine]] is the second-largest country in Europe. It has a strategic position in [[Eastern Europe]], bordering the [[Black Sea]] in the south,  [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] in the west, [[Moldova]], [[Romania]] and the [[Black Sea]] in the south, [[Belarus]] in the north, and [[Russia]] in the east. The northern part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] (highest peak [[Hoverla]], 2061 m) reach into Ukraine in the western part of the country, but most of its area is taken up by the [[steppe]] north of the Black Sea, divided by the [[Dnieper]], which traverses Ukraine north to south, joining the Black Sea west of the [[Crimea]], near the mouths of the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and the [[Dniester]]. The border with Russia runs through the [[Sea of Azov]].

-[[Ukraine]] is the second-largest country in Europe. It has a strategic position in [[Eastern Europe]], bordering the [[Black Sea]] in the south,  [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] in the west, [[Belarus]] in the north, [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]] in the south-west and [[Russia]] in the east. The northern part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] (highest peak [[Hoverla]], 2061 m) reach into Ukraine in the western part of the country, but most of its area is taken up by the [[steppe]] north of the Black Sea, divided by the [[Dnieper]], which traverses Ukraine north to south, joining the Black Sea west of the [[Crimea]], near the mouths of the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and the [[Dniester]]. The border with Russia runs through the [[Sea of Azov]]. The reason for the toxic and poor soil is because it was originally used for nuclear testing by the russians. After they were finished they used it as a prison for petifiles, and finally, the country it is today. Many Ukrainians still sufer from radiation today because of this.

 [[Ukraine]] is the second-largest country in Europe. It has a strategic position in [[Eastern Europe]], bordering the [[Black Sea]] in the south,  [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] in the west, [[Belarus]] in the north, [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]] in the south-west and [[Russia]] in the east. The northern part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] (highest peak [[Hoverla]], 2061 m) reach into Ukraine in the western part of the country, but most of its area is taken up by the [[steppe]] north of the Black Sea, divided by the [[Dnieper]], which traverses Ukraine north to south, joining the Black Sea west of the [[Crimea]], near the mouths of the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and the [[Dniester]]. The border with Russia runs through the [[Sea of Azov]].

 [[Ukraine]] is the second-largest country in Europe.

The northern part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] (highest peak [[Hoverla]], 2061 m) reach into Ukraine in the western part of the country, but most of its area is taken up by the [[steppe]] north of the Black Sea, divided by the [[Dnieper]], which traverses Ukraine north to south, joining the Black Sea west of the [[Crimea]], near the mouths of the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and the [[Dniester]]. The border with Russia runs through the [[Sea of Azov]].

 [[Ukraine]] is the second-largest country in Europe. Its geography varies significantly depending on regions.

 It has a strategic position in [[Eastern Europe]], bordering the [[Black Sea]] in the south,  [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] in the west, [[Belarus]] in the north, [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]] in the south-west and [[Russia]] in the east. The northern part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] (highest peak [[Hoverla]], 2061 m) reaches into Ukraine in the western part of the country, but most of its area is taken up by the [[steppe]] north of the Black Sea, divided by the [[Dnieper|Dnipro]], which traverses Ukraine north to south, joining the Black Sea west of the [[Crimea]], near the mouths of the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and the [[Dniester|Dnister]]. The border with Russia runs through the [[Sea of Azov]].

 It has a strategic position in [[Eastern Europe]], bordering the [[Black Sea]] in the south,  [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] in the west, [[Belarus]] in the north, [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]] in the south-west and [[Russia]] in the east. The northern part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] (highest peak [[Hoverla]], 2061 m) reaches into Ukraine in the western part of the country, but most of its area is taken up by the [[steppe]] north of the Black Sea, divided by the [[Dnieper|Dnipro]], which traverses Ukraine north to south, joining the Black Sea west of the [[Crimea]], near the mouths of the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and the [[Dniester|Dnister]]. The border with Russia runs through the [[Sea of Azov]].

 [[Ukraine]] is the second-largest country in Europe. Its geography varies significantly depending on regions.
 
 ==Geographic location==
-Ukraine has a strategic position in [[Eastern Europe]], bordering the [[Black Sea]] in the south,  [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] in the west, [[Belarus]] in the north, [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]] in the south-west and [[Russia]] in the east. 
+Ukraine has a strategic position in [[East Central Europe]], bordering the [[Black Sea]] in the south,  [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] in the west, [[Belarus]] in the north, [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]] in the south-west and [[Russia]] in the east. 
 
 The northern part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] (highest peak [[Hoverla]], 2061 m or 6762&nbsp;ft) reaches into Ukraine in the western part of the country, but most of its area is taken up by the [[steppe]]-like region just north of the [[Black Sea]]. Ukraine is divided almost in half by the [[Dnieper|Dnipro]] river, which traverses Ukraine north to south. It is joined by the Black Sea, which is west of the [[Crimea]] and near the mouths of the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and the [[Dniester|Dnister]] rivers. The border with Russia is the longest and runs through the [[Sea of Azov]].

 '''Geography of [[Ukraine]]''' varies greatly from one region of the country to another. Ukraine is the second-largest country by area in Europe after the [[Russian Federation]]. Its various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands as well as climatic range and a wide variety in hydrography.
 
 ==Geographic location==
-Ukraine has a strategic position in [[East Central Europe]], bordering the [[Black Sea]] in the south,  [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] in the west, [[Belarus]] in the north, [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]] in the south-west and [[Russia]] in the east.

Most of its territory lays within the [[Great European Plain]], while parts of western regions reach into the [[Pannonian Plain]]. The southern shores of [[Crimea]] are located within a unique subtropical biome which is separated from most of Ukraine by a range of [[Crimean Mountains]]. In general Ukraine is split between between two biomes [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|mixed forest]] towards the middle of continent and [[Steppe|grassland]]  towards Black Sea littoral. The western regions located in the alpine-like country that is dominated by the [[Carpathian Mountains]].
 
 The northern part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] reach into Ukraine in the western part of the country. The highest peak is [[Hoverla]], which is 2061 m or 6762&nbsp;ft tall. Most of Ukraine's area is taken up by the [[steppe]]-like region just north of the [[Black Sea]]. Ukraine is divided almost in half by the [[Dnieper|Dnipro]] river, which traverses Ukraine north to south. It empties into the Black Sea, just west of the [[Crimea]] and near the mouths of the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and the [[Dniester|Dnister]] rivers. The border with Russia is the country's longest border, and it runs through the [[Sea of Azov]].

 '''Geography of [[Ukraine]]''' varies greatly from one region of the country to another. Majority of the country's territory lays within the [[East European Plain]]. Ukraine is the second-largest country by area in Europe after the [[Russian Federation]]. Its various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands as well as climatic range and a wide variety in hydrography.
 
 ==Geographic location==
-Ukraine has a strategic position in [[East Central Europe]], laying on the northern shores [[Black Sea]] and [[Sea of Azov]] it borders number of European countries [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] in the west, [[Belarus]] in the north, [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]] in the south-west and [[Russia]] in the east. Most of its territory lays within the [[Great European Plain]], while parts of western regions reach into the [[Pannonian Plain]]. The southern shores of [[Crimea]] are located within a unique subtropical biome which is separated from most of Ukraine by a range of [[Crimean Mountains]]. In general Ukraine is split between between two biomes [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|mixed forest]] towards the middle of continent and [[Steppe|grassland]]  towards Black Sea littoral.

 The northern part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] reach into Ukraine in the western part of the country. The highest peak is [[Hoverla]], which is 2061 m or 6762&nbsp;ft tall. Most of Ukraine's area is taken up by the [[steppe]]-like region just north of the [[Black Sea]]. Ukraine is divided almost in half by the [[Dnieper|Dnipro]] river, which traverses Ukraine north to south. It empties into the Black Sea, just west of the [[Crimea]] and near the mouths of the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and the [[Dniester|Dnister]] rivers. The border with Russia is the country's longest border, and it runs through the [[Sea of Azov]].

 The '''geography of [[Ukraine]]''' varies greatly from one region of the country to another. Majority of the country's territory lays within the [[East European Plain]]. Ukraine is the second-largest country by area in Europe after the [[Russian Federation]]. Its various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands as well as climatic range and a wide variety in hydrography.
-I like butts.

 ==Geographic location==
 Ukraine has a strategic position in [[East Central Europe]], lying on the northern shores [[Black Sea]] and [[Sea of Azov]] it borders number of European countries [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] in the west, [[Belarus]] in the north, [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]] in the south-west and [[Russia]] in the east. Most of its territory lays within the [[Great European Plain]], while parts of western regions reach into the [[Pannonian Plain]]. The southern shores of [[Crimea]] are located within a unique subtropical biome which is separated from most of Ukraine by a range of [[Crimean Mountains]]. In general Ukraine is split between two biomes [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|mixed forest]] towards the middle of continent and [[Steppe|grassland]]  towards Black Sea littoral. The western regions located in the alpine-like country that is dominated by the [[Carpathian Mountains]].
-I like butts.
+
 The northern part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] reach into Ukraine in the western part of the country. The highest peak is [[Hoverla]], which is 2061 m or 6762&nbsp;ft tall. Most of Ukraine's area is taken up by the [[steppe]]-like region just north of the [[Black Sea]]. Ukraine is divided almost in half by the [[Dnieper|Dnipro]] river, which traverses Ukraine north to south. It empties into the Black Sea, just west of the [[Crimea]] and near the mouths of the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and the [[Dniester|Dnister]] rivers. The border with Russia is the country's longest border, and it runs through the [[Sea of Azov]].

 The '''geography of [[Ukraine]]''' varies greatly from one region of the country to another, with the majority of the country lying within the [[East European Plain]]. Ukraine is the second-largest country by area in Europe after the [[Russian Federation]]. Its various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands as well as climatic range and a wide variety in hydrography.
 
 ==Geographic location==
-Ukraine has a strategic position in [[East Central Europe]], lying on the northern shores [[Black Sea]] and [[Sea of Azov]] it borders number of European countries [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] in the west, [[Belarus]] in the north, [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]] in the south-west and [[Russia]] in the east. Most of its territory lays within the [[Great European Plain]], while parts of western regions reach into the [[Pannonian Plain]]. The southern shores of [[Crimea]] are located within a unique subtropical biome which is separated from most of Ukraine by a range of [[Crimean Mountains]]. In general Ukraine is split between two biomes [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|mixed forest]] towards the middle of continent and [[Steppe|grassland]]  towards Black Sea littoral. The western regions located in the alpine-like country that is dominated by the [[Carpathian Mountains]].

 The northern part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] reach into Ukraine in the western part of the country. The highest peak is [[Hoverla]], which is 2061 m or 6762&nbsp;ft tall. Most of Ukraine's area is taken up by the [[steppe]]-like region just north of the [[Black Sea]]. Ukraine is divided almost in half by the [[Dnieper|Dnipro]] river, which traverses Ukraine north to south. It empties into the Black Sea, just west of the [[Crimea]] and near the mouths of the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and the [[Dniester|Dnister]] rivers. The border with Russia is the country's longest border, and it runs through the [[Sea of Azov]].

 The '''geography of [[Ukraine]]''' varies greatly from one region of the country to another, with the majority of the country lying within the [[East European Plain]]. Ukraine is the second-largest country by area in Europe after the [[Russian Federation]]. Its various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands as well as climatic range and a wide variety in hydrography.
 
 ==Geographic location==
-Ukraine has a strategic position in [[East Central Europe]], lying on the northern shores of [[Black Sea]] and [[Sea of Azov]], it borders number of European countries [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] in the west, [[Belarus]] in the north, [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]] in the south-west and [[Russia]] in the east. Most of its territory lays within the [[Great European Plain]], while parts of western regions reach into the [[Pannonian Plain]]. The southern shores of [[Crimea]] are located within a unique subtropical biome which is separated from most of Ukraine by a range of [[Crimean Mountains]]. In general Ukraine is split between two biomes [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|mixed forest]] towards the middle of continent and [[Steppe|grassland]]  towards Black Sea littoral. The western regions located in the alpine-like country that is dominated by the [[Carpathian Mountains]].

 The '''geography of [[Ukraine]]''' varies greatly from one region of the country to another, with the majority of the country lying within the [[East European Plain]]. Ukraine is the second-largest country by area in Europe after the [[Russian Federation]]. Its various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands as well as climatic range and a wide variety in hydrography.
 
-==Geographic location==
-Ukraine has a strategic position in [[East Central Europe]], lying on the northern shores of [[Black Sea]] and [[Sea of Azov]], it borders a number of European countries [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] in the west, [[Belarus]] in the north, [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]] in the south-west and [[Russia]] in the east. Most of its territory lays within the [[Great European Plain]], while parts of western regions reach into the [[Pannonian Plain]]. The southern shores of [[Crimea]] are located within a unique subtropical biome which is separated from most of Ukraine by a range of [[Crimean Mountains]]. In general Ukraine is split between two biomes [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|mixed forest]] towards the middle of continent and [[Steppe|grassland]]  towards Black Sea littoral. The western regions located in the alpine-like country that is dominated by the [[Carpathian Mountains]].

-The northern part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] reach into Ukraine in the western part of the country. The highest peak is [[Hoverla]], which is 2061 m or 6762&nbsp;ft tall. Most of Ukraine's area is taken up by the [[steppe]]-like region just north of the [[Black Sea]]. Ukraine is divided almost in half by the [[Dnieper|Dnipro]] river, which traverses Ukraine north to south. It empties into the Black Sea, just west of the [[Crimea]] and near the mouths of the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and the [[Dniester|Dnister]] rivers. The border with Russia is the country's longest border, and it runs through the [[Sea of Azov]].

The western regions fesature  alpine-like country dominated by the [[Carpathian Mountains]].
 
-The northern part of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] reaches into Ukraine in the western part of the country. The highest peak is [[Hoverla]], which is {{convert | 2061 | m | ft}} tall. Most of Ukraine's area is taken up by the [[steppe]]-like region just north of the [[Black Sea]]. Ukraine is divided almost in half by the [[Dnieper|Dnipro]] river, which traverses Ukraine north to south.

 The territory of Ukraine is bordered by the waters of the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Sea of Azov]]. More than 95% of the rivers are part of those two seas' [[drainage basin]]s. A few rivers are part of the [[Baltic Sea]] basin. There are seven major rivers in Ukraine: [[Desna River|Desna]], [[Dnieper|Dnipro]], [[Dniester|Dnister]], [[Danube]], [[Pripyat River|Prypiat]], [[Siverian Donets]], and [[Southern Buh]].
 
-Ukraine is divided almost in half by the [[Dnieper|Dnipro]] river, which traverses Ukraine north to south. It empties into the Black Sea, just west of the [[Crimean peninsula]] and near the mouths of the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and the [[Dniester|Dnister]] rivers.

+Most of Ukraine consists of regular plains with the average height [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] being {{convert |175| m}}. It is surrounded by mountains to its west and extreme south. Wide spaces of the country's plains are located in the south-western part of the [[East European Plain]]. The plains have numerous highlands and lowlands caused by the uneven crystallized base of the [[East European craton]]. The highlands are characterized by [[Precambrian]] [[Basement (geology)|basement rocks]] from the [[Ukrainian Shield]].
+
+Plains are considered elevations of no more than {{convert|0-600|m|ft|abbr=on}} among which there are recognized lowlands (plains) and uplands (plateaus, ridges, hill ridges).

 The '''geography of Ukraine''' varies greatly from one region of the country to another, with the majority of the country lying within the [[East European Plain]]. [[Ukraine]] is the second-largest country by area in Europe (after the [[Russian Federation]]). Its various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from highlands to lowlands, as well as climatic range and a wide variety in hydrography.

+[[File:Говерла з Кукула.jpg|thumb|right|A view of [[Ukrainian Carpathian mountains|Carpathian National Park]] and [[Hoverla]] at {{cvt|2061|m}}, the highest mountain in Ukraine]]
+Ukraine is the [[List of European countries by area|second-largest European country]], after Russia.  Lying between latitudes [[44th parallel north|44°]] and [[53rd parallel north|53° N]], and longitudes [[22nd meridian east|22°]] and [[41st meridian east|41° E]]., it is mostly in the [[East European Plain]]. Ukraine covers an area of {{convert|603628|km2}}, with a coastline of {{convert|2782|km}}.<ref name=""cia""/> 
+
+The landscape of Ukraine consists mostly of fertile plains (or [[steppes]]) and plateaus, crossed by rivers such as the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] ({{lang|uk-Latn|Dnipro}}), [[Seversky Donets]], [[Dniester]] and the [[Southern Bug]] as they flow south into the [[Black Sea]] and the smaller [[Sea of Azov]]. To the southwest, the [[Danube Delta|delta]] of the [[Danube]] forms the border with Romania. Ukraine's various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands. The country's only mountains are the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, of which the highest is [[Hoverla]] at {{convert|2061|m}}, and the [[Crimean Mountains]], in the extreme south along the coast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30093/Ukraine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115052701/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30093/Ukraine |archive-date=15 January 2008 |title=Ukraine – Relief |access-date=27 December 2007 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica (fee required) |url-status=dead}}</ref>
+
+Ukraine also has a number of highland regions such as the [[Volhynian-Podolian Upland|Volyn-Podillia Upland]] (in the west) and the Near-Dnipro Upland (on the right bank of Dnieper). To the east there are the south-western spurs of the [[Central Russian Upland]] over which runs the border with the Russian Federation. Near the [[Sea of Azov]] can be found the Donets Ridge and the Near Azov Upland. The [[snow melt]] from the mountains feeds the rivers and their [[waterfalls of Ukraine|waterfalls]].
+
+Significant natural resources in Ukraine include iron ore, coal, manganese, natural gas, oil, salt, sulphur, graphite, titanium, magnesium, [[kaolin]], nickel, mercury, timber and an abundance of arable land. Despite this, the country faces a number of major environmental issues such as inadequate supplies of potable water; air and water pollution and deforestation, as well as radiation contamination in the north-east from the [[Chernobyl disaster|1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]]. [[Hazardous waste|Recycling toxic household waste]]{{Clarify|date=March 2022}} is still in its infancy in Ukraine.<ref>{{cite news |author=Oksana Grytsenko |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/118498/ |title=Environment suffers from lack of recycling |newspaper=[[Kyiv Post]] |date=9 December 2011|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120105012539/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/118498/ |archive-date=5 January 2012}}</ref>

Notably, the revision also includes minor grammatical adjustments, such as the removal of a semicolon and the addition of a comma in the environmental issues section.

**Weaponised**: The change to ""the border with Russia"" simplifies the reference to the country, which can subtly shift the tone from a formal recognition of the state to a more casual mention. This could reflect an attempt to diminish the perceived legitimacy of the Russian state in the context of the article, aligning with narratives that may be weaponized in discussions about territorial integrity and sovereignty.",Weaponised

 ===Physiographic division of Ukraine===
 Most of Ukraine consists of regular plains with the average height [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] being {{convert |175| m}}. It is surrounded by mountains to its west and extreme south. Wide spaces of the country's plains are located in the south-western part of the [[East European Plain]]. The plains have numerous highlands and lowlands caused by the uneven crystallized base of the [[East European craton]]. The highlands are characterized by [[Precambrian]] [[Basement (geology)|basement rocks]] from the [[Ukrainian Shield]].
 
-Plains are considered elevations of no more than {{convert|0-600|m|ft|abbr=on}} among which there are recognized lowlands (plains) and uplands (plateaus, ridges, hill ridges).

 [[File:Pontic Caspian climate.png|thumb|300px|Simplified depiction of the [[biome]]s lying north of the Black Sea. The bright green belt girdling the Black Sea's southern coast, extending westwards, denotes a region of [[subtropics]].]]
 Most of its territory lies within the [[Great European Plain]], while parts of western regions and southern regions lay within the [[Alpine system]]. In general Ukraine comprises two different [[biome]]s: [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|mixed forest]] towards the middle of the continent, and [[steppe]] towards the Black Sea littoral. Major provinces include, [[Polesian Lowland]], [[Dnieper Lowland]], Volhynia-Podolie Plateau, Black Sea-Azov Lowland, Donets-Azov Plateau, [[Central Russian Upland]], [[Carpathians]], and [[Pannonian Basin]].
 
-The western regions feature an alpine-like section of [[Carpathian Mountains]], the Eastern Carpathians that stretches across Poland, Ukraine and Romania. The highest peak is [[Hoverla]], which is {{convert|2061|m|ft}} tall. Mountains are limited to the west, the southern tip of Ukraine on the [[Sea of Azov]]. The western region has the [[Carpathian Mountains]], and some eroded mountains from the [[Donets Ridge]] are in the east near the Sea of Azov. The highest elevation in Ukraine is located at the peak of [[Hora Hoverla|Mount Hoverla]] which is {{convert|2061|m|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

 Most of Ukraine's area is taken up by the [[steppe]]-like region just north of the [[Black Sea]]. Most of Ukraine consists of fertile plains (or [[steppe]]s) and [[plateau]]s. In terms of land use, 58% of Ukraine is considered arable land; 2% is used for permanent crops, 13% for permanent pastures, 18% is forests and woodland, and 9% is other.

In general Ukraine comprises two different [[biome]]s: [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|mixed forest]] towards the middle of the continent, and [[steppe]] towards the Black Sea littoral. Major provinces include, [[Polesian Lowland]], [[Dnieper Lowland]], Volhynia-Podolie Plateau, Black Sea-Azov Lowland, Donets-Azov Plateau, [[Central Russian Upland]], [[Carpathians]], and [[Pannonian Basin]].

The highest peak is [[Hora Hoverla|Mount Hoverla]], which at {{convert|2061|m|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] is the highest point in the country.

In terms of land use, 58% of Ukraine is considered arable land; 2% is used for permanent crops, 13% for permanent pastures, 18% is forests and woodland, and 9% is other.
