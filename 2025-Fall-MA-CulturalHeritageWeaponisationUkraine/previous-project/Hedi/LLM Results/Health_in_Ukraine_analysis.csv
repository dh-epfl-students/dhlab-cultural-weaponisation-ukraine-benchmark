Men with primary education and women with higher education are inclined to smoking. Some 80% of daily smokers are men. The average age that daily smokers start the habit is decreasing, and at present is 16 years. In the younger age group there are four times as many smokers as in the older age group.

 As of June 2019, Ukraine is suffering one of the world's worst [[Epidemiology of measles|measles epidemics]] with more than 100,000 cases since 2017, with 16 deaths in 2018. In 2016 only 31% of the population had been immunised with the [[MMR vaccine]]. Various reasons are given for the low rate of vaccination including: a distrust of the state in the 1990s, a failure to keep vaccine supplies reliably refrigerated leading to ineffectiveness, a poorly informed medical profession and a high level of vaccine distrust in the wider population. Children are required to be vaccinated before entering the school system, but [[Unicef]] estimates that as many as 30% of vaccination certificates are falsified.<ref name=bbc-20190622>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-48668841 |title=The medical student who died of measles |author1=Tim Whewell |author2=Kateryna Shipko |author3=Diana Kuryshko |work=BBC News |date=22 June 2019 |accessdate=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref name=science-20190212>{{cite journal |last1=Wadman |first1=Meredith |title=Measles cases have tripled in Europe, fueled by Ukrainian outbreak |journal=Science |date=12 February 2019 |doi=10.1126/science.aaw9903 |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/measles-cases-have-tripled-europe-fueled-ukrainian-outbreak |accessdate=17 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218021350/https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/measles-cases-have-tripled-europe-fueled-ukrainian-outbreak |archive-date=18 February 2019 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

 As of June 2019, Ukraine is suffering one of the world's worst [[Epidemiology of measles|measles epidemics]] with more than 100,000 cases since 2017, with 16 deaths in 2018. In 2016 only 31% of the population had been immunised with the [[MMR vaccine]]. Various reasons are given for the low rate of vaccination including: a distrust of the state in the 1990s, a failure to keep vaccine supplies reliably refrigerated leading to ineffectiveness, a poorly informed medical profession and a high level of vaccine distrust in the wider population. Children are required to be vaccinated before entering the school system, but [[Unicef]] estimates that as many as 30% of vaccination certificates are falsified.<ref name=bbc-20190622>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-48668841 |title=The medical student who died of measles |author1=Tim Whewell |author2=Kateryna Shipko |author3=Diana Kuryshko |work=BBC News |date=22 June 2019 |access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref name=science-20190212>{{cite journal |last1=Wadman |first1=Meredith |title=Measles cases have tripled in Europe, fueled by Ukrainian outbreak |journal=Science |date=12 February 2019 |doi=10.1126/science.aaw9903 |s2cid=134362877 |url=https://www.science.org/content/article/measles-cases-have-tripled-europe-fueled-ukrainian-outbreak |access-date=17 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218021350/https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/measles-cases-have-tripled-europe-fueled-ukrainian-outbreak |archive-date=18 February 2019 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref>
