+
+In [[1876]] the completely different Turkish Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language, with a preference given to the more southern dialect  in order to break the link between the Tatar and the Turkish of the [[Ottoman Empire]].
+
+In [[1928]] the alphabet was replaced with the then [[Uniform Turkisch Alphabet]] (a combination of the [[Latin alphabet]] and the [[Cyrillic alphabet]]), which however was in 1938 itself replaced with a modified Cyrillic Alphabet.
+
+After the repatriation of the Crimean Tatars it was Latinized again.
+
+In [[1992]]/[[1993|93]] Crimean Tatar was made the third official language of the peninsula, as by then its speakers made up 10% of the population.
+
+The Crimean Tatar alphabet is the same as the [[Turkish alphabet]] with two additional characters: [[Ñ]] ñ and [[Q]] q.
+
+Since 2002 the Crimean Tatars have been writing with a new [[Turkish alphabet]],
+that was jointly developed from Turkish and Crimean Tatar students at the 
+[[University of Istanbul]] for the Crimean Tatar language.

-== History, dialects, and alphabet ==
-The spoken language of the Crimean Tatars has existed since the [[13th century]], and consists of three main dialects: ""Kypchak-Tatar"" from the [[Crimean Mountains]], ""Kypchak-Nogay"" from the northern steppes, and the coastal ""Crimea-Osman"". The [[Chagatai language]] also served the Crimean Tatar as a [[Dachsprache]]. After [[Islamification]], these people wrote with a Persian-Arab script.
+== Dialects ==

-In [[1876]] different Turkish Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language, with a preference given to the more southern dialect in order to break the link between the Tatar and the Turks of the [[Ottoman Empire]].
+== History == 
+The forming of the Crimean Tatar spoken dialects had begun with the first Turkic invasions to Crimea and ended in general during the period of the [[Crimean Khanate]].

After the [[Islamization]] Crimean Tatars wrote with a Persian-Arab script.

 Today, more than 260,000 Crimean Tatars live in Crimea, and approximately 150,000 are still in exile in Central Asia (mainly in Uzbekistan).

Actually, Crimean Tatar is similar to both Kypchak and [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] Turkic languages. A Crimean Tatar speaker can understand languages of both Kypchak and Oghuz origin.

 In 1876, the different Turkish Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language by [[İsmail Gaspıralı]]. A preference was given to the Oghuz dialect of the Yalıboylus not to break the link between the Crimeans and the Turks of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1928, it was reoriented to the middle dialect.

This dialect is a direct descendant of the [[Cuman language]], but it has been strongly influenced by the Oghuz Turkic. The modern Crimean Tatar written language is based on this middle dialect because the Tats comprise about 55% of the total Crimean Tatar population and their dialect is equally intelligible to the speakers of the others.

However, the official written languages of the Crimean Khanate were [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. After the [[Islamization]], Crimean Tatars wrote with an Arab script.
 
 In 1876, the different Turkish Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language by [[İsmail Gaspıralı]]. A preference was given to the Oghuz dialect of the Yalıboylus not to break the link between the Crimeans and the Turks of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1928, it was reoriented to the middle dialect.

 In 1928, the alphabet was replaced with the [[Uniform Turkic Alphabet]] based on the [[Latin alphabet]]. The Uniform Turkic Alphabet was itself replaced in 1938 by a modified [[Cyrillic alphabet]]. Since 1990s, the script is in the process of being replaced with a Latin version again, but the Cyrillic is still widely used (mainly in published literature and newspapers). The current Latin-based Crimean Tatar alphabet is the same as the [[Turkish alphabet]] with two additional characters: [[Ñ]] ñ and [[Q]] q.

 Each of the three subethnic groups of the Crimean Tatars has its own dialect. The dialect of the Noğays – the former inhabitants of the Crimean steppe (should not be confused with [[Nogais|Nogai people]]) – is of [[Kypchak]] origin, Yalıboylus, who lived on the southern coast of Crimea before 1944, speak an [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] dialect very close to [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and the middle dialect of the [[Tat Tatars]] from the [[Crimean Mountains]] (should not be confused with [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat people]]) is a mixture of the two. This dialect is a direct descendant of the [[Cuman language]], but it has been strongly influenced by the Oghuz Turkic.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The modern Crimean Tatar written language is based on this middle dialect because the Tats comprise about 55% of the total Crimean Tatar population and their dialect is equally intelligible to the speakers of the others.

 ==Dialects==
 Each of the three subethnic groups of the Crimean Tatars has its own dialect. The dialect of the Noğays – the former inhabitants of the Crimean steppe (should not be confused with [[Nogais|Nogai people]]) – is of [[Kypchak]] origin, Yalıboylus, who lived on the southern coast of Crimea before 1944, speak an [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] dialect very close to [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and the middle dialect of the [[Tat Tatars]] from the [[Crimean Mountains]] (should not be confused with [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat people]]) is a mixture of the two. This dialect is a direct descendant of the [[Cuman language]], but it has been strongly influenced by the Oghuz Turkic.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The modern Crimean Tatar written language is based on this middle dialect because the Tats comprise about 55% of the total Crimean Tatar population and their dialect is equally intelligible to the speakers of the others.

The dialect of the Nogays—the former inhabitants of the Crimean steppe (should not be confused with [[Nogais|Nogai people]])—is of [[Kypchak]]–Nogay origin, Yalıboylus, who lived on the southern coast of Crimea before 1944, speak an [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] dialect and the middle dialect of the [[Tat Tatars]] from the [[Crimean Mountains]] (should not be confused with [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat people]]) is of Kypchak–Cuman origin. This dialect is a direct descendant of the [[Cuman language]], but it has been strongly influenced by the Oghuz.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The modern Crimean Tatar written language is based on this middle dialect because the Tats comprise about 55% of the total Crimean Tatar population.",,91.225.155.239,2014-06-14T13:51:38Z,"Changed the order of countries listed in the ""states"" field from ""Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Uzbekistan"" to ""Ukraine, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Romania, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Bulgaria"".

 ==History==
 The forming of the Crimean Tatar spoken dialects began with the first Turkic invasions to Crimea and ended during the period of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. However, the official written languages of the Crimean Khanate were [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. After the [[Islamization]], Crimean Tatars wrote with an [[Arabic script]].
 
-In 1876, the different Turkish Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language by [[Ismail Gasprinski]]. A preference was given to the Oghuz dialect of the Yalıboylus, in order to not break the link between the Crimeans and the Turks of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1928, it was reoriented to the middle dialect.

In 1928, it was reoriented to the middle dialect.
 
 In 1928, the alphabet was replaced with the [[Uniform Turkic Alphabet]] based on the [[Latin script]]. The Uniform Turkic Alphabet was itself replaced in 1938 by a [[Cyrillic alphabets|Cyrillic alphabet]]. Since the 1990s, the script is in the process of being replaced with a Latin version again, but the Cyrillic is still widely used (mainly in published literature and newspapers). The current Latin-based Crimean Tatar alphabet is the same as the [[Turkish alphabet]] with two additional characters: [[Ñ]] ñ and [[Q]] q.

After [[Islamization]], Crimean Tatars wrote with an [[Arabic script]].
 
 In 1876, the different Turkic Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language by [[Ismail Gasprinski]]. A preference was given to the Oghuz dialect of the Yalıboylus, in order to not break the link between the Crimeans and the Turks of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1928, the language was reoriented to the middle dialect spoken by the majority of the people.

 ==History==
-The forming of the Crimean Tatar spoken dialects began with the first Turkic invasions to Crimea and ended during the period of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. However, the official written languages of the Crimean Khanate were [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. After the [[Islamization]], Crimean Tatars wrote with an [[Arabic script]].
-
-In 1876, the different Turkic Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language by [[Ismail Gasprinski]]. A preference was given to the Oghuz dialect of the Yalıboylus, in order to not break the link between the Crimeans and the Turks of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1928, it was reoriented to the middle dialect.
-
-In 1928, the alphabet was replaced with the [[Uniform Turkic Alphabet]] based on the [[Latin script]]. The Uniform Turkic Alphabet was itself replaced in 1938 by a [[Cyrillic alphabets|Cyrillic alphabet]]. Since the 1990s, the script is in the process of being replaced with a Latin version again, but the Cyrillic is still widely used (mainly in published literature and newspapers). The current Latin-based Crimean Tatar alphabet is the same as the [[Turkish alphabet]] with two additional characters: [[Ñ]] ñ and [[Q]] q.

 Almost all Crimean Tatars are bilingual or multilingual, using as their first language the dominant languages of their respective home countries, such as Russian, Turkish, Romanian, Uzbek, Bulgarian or Ukrainian.
 
-==Dialects==
-Each of the three subethnic groups of the Crimean Tatars has its own dialect. The dialect of the Nogays, the former inhabitants of the Crimean steppe (should not be confused with [[Nogais|Nogai people]]), is of [[Kypchak]]–Nogay origin.
-
-The Yalıboylus, who lived on the southern coast of Crimea before 1944, speak an [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] dialect.
-
-The [[Tat Tatars]] from the [[Crimean Mountains]] (should not be confused with [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat people]]) use a middle dialect of Kypchak–Cuman origin. The dialect is a direct descendant of the [[Cuman language]], but it has been strongly influenced by Oghuz.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The modern Crimean Tatar written language is based on Tat because the Tats comprise about 55% of the total Crimean Tatar population.
+==Classification and dialects==
+
+Crimean Tatar is conventionally divided into three main dialects: northern, middle and southern.
+
+The middle dialect is spoken in the [[Crimean Mountains]] by the sedentary ''Tat'' Tatars (should not be confused with the [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat people]] which speak an [[Iranic language]]). The modern Crimean Tatar written language is based on Tat Tatar because the Tat Tatars comprise a relative majority.
+
+Standard Crimean Tatar and its middle dialect classified as a language of the Pontic or Cuman ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-половецкая}}) subgroup of the [[Kipchak languages]] and the closest relatives are [[Karachay-Balkar language|Karachay-Balkar]], [[Karaim language|Karaim]], [[Krymchak language|Krymchak]], [[Kumyk language|Kumyk]], [[Urum language|Urum]] and extinct [[Cuman language|Cuman]].
+
+However, two other unwritten dialects of Crimean Tatar belong to two different groups or subgroups of the Turkic languages.
+
+The northern dialect (also known as steppe or Nogay) is spoken by the ''Noğay'' ethnic subgroup, the former nomadic inhabitants of the Crimean (Nogay) steppe (should not be confused with [[Nogais|Nogai people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus]] and the [[Lower Volga]]). This dialect belong to the Nogay ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-ногайская}}) subgroup of the [[Kipchak languages]]. This subgroups also includes [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], and [[Nogai language|Nogai]] proper. It is thought that the Nogays of the Crimea and the Nogais of the Caucasus and Volga are of common origin from the [[Nogai Horde]], which is reflected in their common name and very closely related languages. In the past some speakers of this dialects also called themselves ''Qıpçaq'' (that is Cumans).
+
+The southern or coastal dialects is spoken by ''Yalıboylu'' (""coastal dwellers"") who have traditionally lived on the southern coast of the Crimea. Their dialects belongs to the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] group of the Turkic languages which includes [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Azeri language|Azeri]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]. This dialect is most heavily influenced by Turkish.
+
+Thus, Crimean Tatar has a unique position among the Turkic languages, because its three ""dialects"" belong to three different (sub)groups of Turkic. This make the classification of Crimean Tatar as a whole difficult. The middle dialect, although thought to be of Kipchak-Cuman orgin, is in fact combine elements of both Cuman and Oghuz languages. This latter fact may also be another reason why Standard Crimean Tatar has had its basis in the middle dialect.
+
+=== Volga Tatar ===
+Because of its common name, Crimean Tatar is sometimes mistaken to be a dialect of [[Tatar language|Tatar proper]], or both being two dialects of the same language. However, Tatar spoken in [[Tatarstan]] and the Volga-Ural region of Russian belongs to the different Bulgaric ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-булгарская}}) subgroup of the Kipchak languages, and its closet relative is [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]]. Both Volga Tatar and Bashkir differ notably from Crimean Tatar, particularly because of the [[Tatar language#Historical shifts|specific Volga-Ural Turkic vocalism and historical shifts]].
 
 ==History==
 The forming of the Crimean Tatar spoken dialects began with the first Turkic invasions of Crimea and ended during the period of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. However, the official written languages of the Crimean Khanate were [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. After [[Islamization]], Crimean Tatars wrote with an [[Arabic script]].

 Because of its common name, Crimean Tatar is sometimes mistaken to be a dialect of [[Tatar language|Tatar proper]], or both being two dialects of the same language. However, Tatar spoken in [[Tatarstan]] and the Volga-Ural region of Russian belongs to the different Bulgaric ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-булгарская}}) subgroup of the Kipchak languages, and its closet relative is [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]]. Both Volga Tatar and Bashkir differ notably from Crimean Tatar, particularly because of the [[Tatar language#Historical shifts|specific Volga-Ural Turkic vocalism and historical shifts]].
 
 ==History==
-The forming of the Crimean Tatar spoken dialects began with the first Turkic invasions of Crimea and ended during the period of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. However, the official written languages of the Crimean Khanate were [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. After [[Islamization]], Crimean Tatars wrote with an [[Arabic script]].

However, the official written languages of the Crimean Khanate were [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. After [[Islamization]], Crimean Tatars wrote with an [[Arabic script]].
 
 In 1876, the different Turkic Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language by [[Ismail Gasprinski]]. A preference was given to the Oghuz dialect of the Yalıboylus, in order to not break the link between the Crimeans and the Turks of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1928, the language was reoriented to the middle dialect spoken by the majority of the people.
 
-In 1928, the alphabet was replaced with the [[Uniform Turkic Alphabet]] based on the [[Latin script]]. The Uniform Turkic Alphabet was replaced in 1938 by a [[Cyrillic alphabets|Cyrillic alphabet]]. Since the 1990s, the government has encouraged replacing the script with a Latin version again, but the Cyrillic is still widely used (mainly in published literature and newspapers). The current Latin-based Crimean Tatar alphabet is the same as the [[Turkish alphabet]], with two additional characters: [[Ñ]] ñ and [[Q]] q.

It should not be confused with [[Tatar language|Tatar proper]], spoken in [[Tatarstan]] and adjacent regions in [[Russia]]; the languages are related, but belong to two different subgroups of the [[Kipchak languages]] and thus are not [[mutually intelligible]]. Crimean Tatar arrived in the 13th century with the Mongol [[Golden Horde]], succeeding the [[Crimean Greeks|Crimean Greek]] and [[Crimean Gothic]] [[Principality of Theodoro]], and continued through the 15th–18th century [[Crimean Khanate]] period. Though only distantly related, it has been extensively influenced by nearby [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz Turkic languages]] such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]].
 
 ==Number of speakers==
 Today, more than 260,000 Crimean Tatars live in [[Crimea]]. Approximately 150,000 reside in Central Asia (mainly in [[Uzbekistan]]), where their ancestors had been exiled in 1944 during World War II by the Soviet Union. However, of all these people, mostly the older generations are the only ones still speaking Crimean Tatar.<ref name=e16>{{e16|crh}}</ref> In 2013, the language was estimated to be on the brink of extinction, being taught in only around 15 schools in Crimea. Turkey has provided support to Ukraine, to aid in bringing the schools teaching in Crimean Tatar to a modern state.<ref>[https://www.avrupatimes.com/culture/3676-crimean-tatar-language-in-danger.html Crimean Tatar language in danger], ''Avrupa Times,'' 02/19/2013</ref>",Rv-V,Arjayay,2019-06-08T15:44:38Z,"The change made in this revision is the addition of an ""Infobox language"" section that provides detailed information about the Crimean Tatar language, including its name, native name, states where it is spoken, number of speakers, and other linguistic classifications. 

Weaponised

The inclusion of the infobox and the context surrounding the Crimean Tatar language emphasizes its cultural significance and the geopolitical context of its speakers, particularly in relation to Ukraine and Russia. This framing can be seen as a way to assert the identity and rights of the Crimean Tatars, which may be interpreted as a form of cultural heritage weaponization in the ongoing conflict.",Weaponised

Additionally, the map caption was changed from ""Crimean Tatar-speaking world"" to ""Crimean-speaking world.""

**Analysis:** The revision appears to downplay the specific identity of the Crimean Tatars by removing the term ""Tatar,"" which is significant to their cultural heritage. This could be interpreted as an attempt to homogenize or erase the distinct identity of the Crimean Tatar people in favor of a broader ""Crimean"" identity, which may align with narratives that seek to diminish the recognition of minority groups in the context of Crimea's political situation.

**Conclusion:** Weaponised. The changes reflect a potential effort to undermine the cultural identity of the Crimean Tatars, which can be seen as a form of cultural heritage weaponization.",Weaponised

 Thus, Crimean Tatar has a unique position among the Turkic languages, because its three ""dialects"" belong to three different (sub)groups of Turkic. This makes the classification of Crimean Tatar as a whole difficult. The middle dialect, although thought to be of Kipchak-Cuman origin, in fact combines elements of both Cuman and Oghuz languages. This latter fact may also be another reason why Standard Crimean Tatar has had its basis in the middle dialect.
 
 === Volga Tatar ===
-Because of its common name, Crimean Tatar is sometimes mistaken to be a dialect of [[Tatar language|Tatar proper]], or both being two dialects of the same language. However, Tatar spoken in [[Tatarstan]] and the Volga-Ural region of Russian belongs to the different Bulgaric ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-булгарская}}) subgroup of the Kipchak languages, and its closet relative is [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]]. Both Volga Tatar and Bashkir differ notably from Crimean Tatar, particularly because of the [[Tatar language#Historical shifts|specific Volga-Ural Turkic vocalism and historical shifts]].

 The northern dialect (also known as steppe or Nogay) is spoken by the ''Noğay'' ethnic subgroup, the former nomadic inhabitants of the Crimean (Nogay) steppe (should not be confused with [[Nogais|Nogai people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus]] and the [[Lower Volga]]). This dialect belongs to the Nogay ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-ногайская}}) subgroup of the [[Kipchak languages]]. This subgroups also includes [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], and [[Nogai language|Nogai]] proper. It is thought that the Nogays of the Crimea and the Nogais of the Caucasus and Volga are of common origin from the [[Nogai Horde]], which is reflected in their common name and very closely related languages.

 Thus, Crimean Tatar has a unique position among the Turkic languages, because its three ""dialects"" belong to three different (sub)groups of Turkic. This makes the classification of Crimean Tatar as a whole difficult. The middle dialect, although thought to be of Kipchak-Cuman origin, in fact combines elements of both Cuman and Oghuz languages. This latter fact may also be another reason why Standard Crimean Tatar has had its basis in the middle dialect.

 The northern dialect (also known as steppe or Nogay) is spoken by the ''Noğay'' ethnic subgroup, the former nomadic inhabitants of the Crimean (Nogay) steppe (should not be confused with [[Nogais|Nogai people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus]] and the [[Lower Volga]]). This dialect belongs to the Nogay ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-ногайская}}) subgroup of the [[Kipchak languages]]. This subgroups also includes [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], and [[Nogai language|Nogai]] proper. It is thought that the Nogays of the Crimea and the Nogais of the Caucasus and Volga are of common origin from the [[Nogai Horde]], which is reflected in their common name and very closely related languages. In the past some speakers of this dialects also called themselves ''Qıpçaq'' (that is Cumans).
 
-The southern or coastal dialects is spoken by ''Yalıboylu'' (""coastal dwellers"") who have traditionally lived on the southern coast of the Crimea. Their dialects belong to the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] group of the Turkic languages which includes [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Azeri language|Azeri]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]].

This dialect is most heavily influenced by Turkish.
 
 Thus, Crimean Tatar has a unique position among the Turkic languages, because its three ""dialects"" belong to three different (sub)groups of Turkic. This makes the classification of Crimean Tatar as a whole difficult. The middle dialect, although thought to be of Kipchak-Cuman origin, in fact combines elements of both Cuman and Oghuz languages. This latter fact may also be another reason why Standard Crimean Tatar has had its basis in the middle dialect.

 Because of its common name, Crimean Tatar is sometimes mistaken to be a dialect of [[Tatar language|Tatar proper]], or both being two dialects of the same language.

After [[Islamization]], Crimean Tatars wrote with an [[Arabic script]].
 
 In 1876, the different Turkic Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language by [[Ismail Gasprinski]].

-The northern dialect (also known as steppe or Nogay) is spoken by the ''Noğay'' ethnic subgroup, the former nomadic inhabitants of the Crimean (Nogay) steppe (should not be confused with [[Nogais|Nogai people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus]] and the [[Lower Volga]]).

 Thus, Crimean Tatar has a unique position among the Turkic languages, because its three ""dialects"" belong to three different (sub)groups of Turkic. This makes the classification of Crimean Tatar as a whole difficult. The middle dialect, although thought to be of Kipchak-Cuman origin, in fact combines elements of both Cuman and Oghuz languages. This latter fact may also be another reason why Standard Crimean Tatar has had its basis in the middle dialect.

-Because of its common name, Crimean Tatar is sometimes mistaken to be a dialect of [[Tatar language|Tatar proper]], or both being two dialects of the same language. However, Tatar spoken in [[Tatarstan]] and the Volga-Ural region of Russia belongs to the different Bulgaric ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-булгарская}}) subgroup of the Kipchak languages, and its closet relative is [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]].

 Because of its common name, Crimean Tatar is sometimes mistaken to be a dialect of [[Tatar language|Tatar proper]], or both being two dialects of the same language. However, Tatar spoken in [[Tatarstan]] and the Volga-Ural region of Russia belongs to the different Bulgaric ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-булгарская}}) subgroup of the Kipchak languages, and its closest relative is [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]].

+{{see also|Crimean Tatar literature}}
 The formation period of the Crimean Tatar spoken dialects began with the first Turkic invasions of Crimea by [[Cuman]]s and [[Pecheneg]]s and ended during the period of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. However, the official written languages of the Crimean Khanate were [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. After [[Islamization]], Crimean Tatars wrote with an [[Arabic script]].
 
 In 1876, the different Turkic Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language by [[Ismail Gasprinski]]. A preference was given to the Oghuz dialect of the Yalıboylus, in order to not break the link between the Crimeans and the Turks of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1928, the language was reoriented to the middle dialect spoken by the majority of the people.
 
-In 1928, the alphabet was replaced with the [[Uniform Turkic Alphabet]] based on the [[Latin script]]. The Uniform Turkic Alphabet was replaced in 1938 by a [[Cyrillic alphabets|Cyrillic alphabet]]. During the 1990s and 2000s, the government of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea under Ukraine encouraged replacing the script with a Latin version again, but the Cyrillic has still been widely used (mainly in published literature, newspapers and education).

 In 1992, a Latin alphabet based on [[Common Turkic Alphabet]] was adopted by the decision of the [[Qurultay of the Crimean Tatar People]], which was formally supported by the [[Supreme Council of Crimea]] in 1997 but never implemented officially on practical level. However, in 2021, the [[Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories]] of Ukraine has announced it begins the implementation of the decision, with vice premier [[Oleksii Reznikov]] supporting the transition by stating that Latin corresponds better to Turkic phonetics. The ministry revealed it plans to finish the transition to Latin by 2025, which was supported by the [[Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People]]. The alphabet is co-developed by [[A. Yu. Krymskyi Institute of Oriental Studies]], [[Potebnia Institute of Linguistics]], Institute of Philology of [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]] and [[Tavrida National V.I.

-Crimean Tatar is conventionally divided into [[Crimean Tatar dialects|three main dialects]]: northern, middle and southern.
-
-The middle dialect is spoken in the [[Crimean Mountains]] by the sedentary ''Tat'' Tatars (should not be confused with the [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat people]] which speak an [[Iranic language]]). The modern Crimean Tatar written language is based on Tat Tatar because the Tat Tatars comprise a relative majority.
-
-Standard Crimean Tatar and its middle dialect are classified as a language of the Cuman ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-половецкая}}) subgroup of the [[Kipchak languages]] and the closest relatives are [[Karachay-Balkar language|Karachay-Balkar]], [[Karaim language|Karaim]], [[Krymchak language|Krymchak]], [[Kumyk language|Kumyk]], [[Urum language|Urum]] and extinct [[Cuman language|Cuman]].
-
-However, two other unwritten dialects of Crimean Tatar belong to two different groups or subgroups of the Turkic languages.
-
-The northern dialect (also known as steppe or Nogay) is spoken by the ''Noğay'' ethnic subgroup, the former nomadic inhabitants of the Crimean (Nogay) steppe (should not be confused with [[Nogais|Nogai people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus]] and the [[Lower Volga]]). This dialect belongs to the Nogay ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-ногайская}}) subgroup of the [[Kipchak languages]]. This subgroups also includes [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], and [[Nogai language|Nogai]] proper. It is thought that the Nogays of the Crimea and the Nogais of the Caucasus and Volga are of common origin from the [[Nogai Horde]], which is reflected in their common name and very closely related languages. In the past some speakers of this dialects also called themselves ''Qıpçaq'' (that is Cumans).
-
-The southern or coastal dialects is spoken by [[Yaliboylu|''Yalıboylu'']] (""coastal dwellers"") who have traditionally lived on the southern coast of the Crimea. Their dialects belong to the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] group of the Turkic languages which includes [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Azeri language|Azeri]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]. This dialect is most heavily influenced by Turkish.
-
-Thus, Crimean Tatar has a unique position among the Turkic languages, because its three ""dialects"" belong to three different (sub)groups of Turkic. This makes the classification of Crimean Tatar as a whole difficult. The middle dialect, although thought to be of Kipchak-Cuman origin, in fact combines elements of both Cuman and Oghuz languages. This latter fact may also be another reason why Standard Crimean Tatar has had its basis in the middle dialect.
+The [[Crimean Tatar language]] consists of three dialects. The standard language is written in the middle dialect ([[bağçasaray]], orta yolaq), which is part of the Kipchak-Cuman branch. There is also the southern dialect, also known as the coastal dialect (yalıboyu, cenübiy), which is in the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] branch, and the northern dialect, also known as nogai dialect (noğay, çöl, şimaliy), which is in the Kipchak-Nogai branch.

+== Grammar ==
+The grammar of Crimean Tatar, like all Turkic languages, is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinating]],<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.33</ref> with the exclusive use of suffixing to express grammatical categories.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.85</ref>  Generally, suffixes are attached to the ends of word stems, although derivational [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] makes uses of compounding as well.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.33</ref>  Overall, the grammatical structure of the language is similar to that of other West Kipchak varieties.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.2</ref>  Crimean Tatar is a [[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]] language<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.99</ref> with a generally [[Subject-object-verb word order|SOV word order]].<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.84</ref>
+
+=== Morphophonology ===
+Crimean Tatar, like most Turkic languages, features pervasive [[Vowel harmony|vowel harmony]], which results in sound changes when suffixes are added to verb or noun stems.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.25</ref>  Essentially, the vowel in a suffix undergoes [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]] to agree in certain categories with the vowel in the stem.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.26</ref>  The two main types of assimilation that characterize this agreement in Crimean Tatar morphophonology are [[Vowel#Backness|backness]] harmony and [[Roundedness|rounding]] harmony.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.25</ref>
+
+Using the [[Transliteration|transliteration]] system in Kavitskaya (2010), non-high vowels undergoing backness harmony vary between [a] and [e], and are represented as '''A'''.  High vowels that undergo both backness and rounding harmony alternate between [i], [y], [ɪ] and [u] and are represented as '''I'''.  High vowels in suffixes that are never rounded and alternate between [i] and [ɪ] are represented as '''Y''', whereas high vowels in suffixes that are always round and alternate between [u] and [y] are represented as '''U'''.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.33</ref>
+
+Some consonants undergo similar harmonizing changes depending on whether the preceding segment is voiced or voiceless, or whether the segment demonstrates backness harmony.  Consonants that alternate between [k], [q], [g] and [ɣ] are represented as '''K''', alternating [k] and [g] as '''G''', alternating [t] and [d] by '''D''', and alternating [tʃ] and [dʒ] as '''Ç'''.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.34</ref>
+
+Thus, the suffix -''şAr'' could be rendered as “şar” or “şer” depending on the vowel in the morpheme preceding it.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.34</ref>  
+
+=== Verbs ===
+Crimean Tatar verbal morphology is fairly complex, inflecting for tense, number, person, aspect, mood and voice.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.61</ref>  Verbs are [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] according to the following paradigm:<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.75</ref>
+
+::{| class=""wikitable""
+|[STEM] + [reflexive] + [causative] + [passive] + [negation] + [tense/aspect/mood] + [person/number]
+|}
+
+It is possible, albeit rare, for a single verb to contain all of these possible components, as in:
+::''Men yuvundırılmadım''.
+::Мен йувундырылмадым.
+::I wash-{{abbr|REFL|Reflexive|}}-{{abbr|CAUS|Causative|}}-{{abbr|PASS|Passive Voice|}}-{{abbr|NEG|Negation|}}-{{abbr|PAST|Past Tense|}}-{{abbr|1SG|First Person Singular|}}
+::“I was not forced to wash myself.”<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.75</ref>
+
+For the most part, each type of suffix would only appear once in any given word, although it is possible in some circumstances for causative suffixes to double up.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.73</ref>
+
+[[Infinitive verb|Infinitive]] verbs take the -''mAK'' suffix and can be [[Negation (linguistics)|negated]] by the addition of the suffix -''mA'' between the verb stem and the infinitive suffix, creating verb constructions that do not easily mirror English.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.75</ref>
+
+<div style=display:inline-table>
+::''yaşamaq''	
+::йaшамакъ
+::“to live”
+</div>
+<div style=display:inline-table>
+::''yaşamamaq''
+::йaшамамакъ
+::“not to live”
+</div>
+
+'''Verb derivation'''	
+	
+Novel verb stems are derived chiefly by applying a verbalizing suffix to a noun or adjective, as demonstrated in the following examples:<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.78</ref> 
+
+<div style=display:inline-table>
+::''tiș'''le'''''
+::тиш'''ле'''
+::tooth-{{abbr|'''VB'''|Verbalizing Suffix|}}
+::“bite”
+</div>
+<div style=display:inline-table>
+::''qara'''r'''''
+::къара'''р'''
+::black-{{abbr|'''VB'''|Verbalizing Suffix|}}
+::“become black”
+</div>
+<div style=display:inline-table>
+::''keç'''ik'''''
+::кеч'''ик'''
+::late-{{abbr|'''VB'''|Verbalizing Suffix|}}
+::“be late”
+</div>
+
+Bare verb stems can also be compounded with noun stems to create new verbs,<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.79</ref> as in:
+::''çeke'''le'''''
+::чеке'''ле'''
+::pull-carry-{{abbr|'''VB'''|Verbalizing Suffix|}}
+::“to overhaul”
+
+'''Person markers'''
+
+There are two types of person markers for finite verbs, [[Pronoun|pronominal]] and [[Possession (linguistics)|possessive]].  Depending on tense and mood, verbs will take one or the other set of endings.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.62</ref>
+

+</div>
+
+[[Grammatical person|Grammatical person]] is not marked in third person singular, and the marker is optional in third person plural.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.63</ref>  As shown above, these markers come as the last element in the broader verb complex.
+
+'''Tense and aspect markers'''	
+
+[[Grammatical tense|Grammatical tense]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] are expressed in combination by the addition of various markers to the verb stem.  Some of these markers match with pronominal person markers, while others take possessive person markers.  Each tense/aspect has an associated negation marker; most of these are -''mA'' but there is some variation.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.63</ref>

+The [[Imperative mood|imperative]] is formed using a specific set of person markers, and negated using -''mA''.  In second person imperatives, only the bare verb stem is used.  A first person imperative expresses an “I/we should do X” sentiment, whereas third person expresses “let him/her do X,” as shown below with ''unut'' (“to forget”):<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.70</ref>

The copula’s past tense form, ''edi'', is suppletive.  Future tense copular forms are constructed by the addition of the categorical future suffix -''cAK''.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.61</ref>

+'''Converbs'''	
+
+[[Converb|Converbs]], a characteristic of many Turkic languages,<ref>Johanson 1995, p.314</ref> express sequential or dependent action.  Present tense converbs are formed by the addition of the suffixes -''A'' (used after consonants) and -''y'' (used after vowels).  In past tense, converbs take the suffix -''Ip''.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.77</ref>  Thus:
+::''Asan evge kel'''ip''' evni temizledi''.
+::Acaн eвгe keл'''ип''' eвни темизледи.

+::“Asan '''came''' home '''and cleaned''' the house.”
+
+=== Nouns ===
+Crimean Tatar noun stems take suffixes which express grammatical number, [[Grammatical case|case]] and possession.  As in all other Turkic languages, there is no [[Grammatical gender|grammatical gender]] in Crimean Tatar.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.35</ref>  Nouns are [[Declension|declined]] according to the following paradigm:<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.35</ref>

+
+'''Noun derivation'''	
+	
+Noun stems are derived in a number of ways.  Most commonly, a bare noun stem can take a denominal suffix which alters its basic meaning.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.39</ref>  Similarly, a bare verb stem can take a deverbal suffix that converts it into a noun.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.41</ref>  There are many such denominal and deverbal suffixes in Crimean Tatar;<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, pp.39-43</ref> some common suffixes are shown below:  
+<div style=display:inline-table>
+{| class=""wikitable""

+|}
+</div>
+
+Noun stems can also be [[Reduplication|reduplicated]], which lends a more generalized meaning.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.43</ref>  The last method of noun derivation is through the compounding of two noun stems.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.44</ref>  Thus:
+<div style=display:inline-table>
+::''qartop-martop''
+::къартоп-мaртоп

+::''ana-baba''
+::aнa-бaбa
+::mother-father
+::“parents”
+</div>
+	
+'''Number''' 
+
+Nouns are pluralized by the addition of the suffix -lAr to the noun stem.  The vowel in this plural suffix agrees phonetically with the final vowel in the stem.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.35</ref>
+::''arabalar''
+::aрaбалар
+::cart-{{abbr|PL|Plural|}}
+::“carts”
+
+Use of the plural can also express [[Honorifics (linguistics)|respect]],<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.36</ref> as in:
+::''Osanovlar keldi''.
+::Oсановлар келди.
+::“Osanov came.”
+
+'''Possession'''	
+
+Possession is expressed through person-specific suffixing.  As with the plural suffix, possession suffixes harmonize with the preceding vowel in regular ways.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.36</ref>

+
+Crimean Tatar has six grammatical cases.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.37</ref>  The nominative case is unmarked, and the remaining cases are expressed through suffixing.  These suffixes come last in a fully declined noun.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.37</ref>

+
+The second person plural pronoun can be used to denote [[T-V distinction|formality or respect]], even if its referent is a single person.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.45</ref>
+
+There are two roots, ''öz''- and ''kendi''-, that express reflexivity.  Of the two, ''kendi''- is more common in the southern dialect, but both are used throughout the entire area in which Crimean Tatar is spoken.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.45</ref>
+
+Possessive pronouns are formed by adding the suffix -''ki'' to the genitive form of a personal pronoun,<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.49</ref> as in:

+
+=== Adjectives ===
+Adjectives in Crimean Tatar precede the nouns they modify.  They do not show agreement, and as such do not take any of the case, person or possession suffixes.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.52</ref>
+
+Adjectives can be derived by the addition of certain suffixes to a noun or verb stem.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.54</ref>

+::Crimea-{{abbr|'''SUF'''|Adjectival Suffix|}}
+::“Crimean”
+</div>
+
+The [[Comparison (grammar)|comparative and superlative]] forms of adjectives are expressed, respectively, by the suffix -''ÇA'' and the particle ''eñ'',<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.52</ref> as in the following examples:	
+
+<div style=display:inline-table>
+::''uzuncur''

+::“hotter”		
+</div>
+<div style=display:inline-table>
+::''eñ balaban''
+::энъ балам
+::“biggest”
+</div>
+
+An idiomatic superlative form using ''episi'' (“all”) in the ablative case is also possible.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.52</ref>
+
+::''O '''episinden''' tatlı pahlava pişire''.
+::О '''эписинден''' татли пахлава пишире.

+::“She cooks the '''sweetest''' baklava.”
+
+=== Postpositions ===		
+Crimean Tatar uses [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]].  Each postposition governs a specific case, either dative, genitive or ablative.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, pp.81-84</ref> Some common postpositions are shown below:

 In 1876, the different Turkic Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language by [[Ismail Gasprinski]]. A preference was given to the Oghuz dialect of the Yalıboylus, in order to not break the link between the Crimeans and the Turks of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1928, the language was reoriented to the middle dialect spoken by the majority of the people.

 In 1992, a Latin alphabet based on [[Common Turkic Alphabet]] was adopted by the decision of the [[Qurultay of the Crimean Tatar People]], which was formally supported by the [[Supreme Council of Crimea]] in 1997 but never implemented officially on practical level. However, in 2021, the [[Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories]] of Ukraine has announced it begins the implementation of the decision, with vice premier [[Oleksii Reznikov]] supporting the transition by stating that Latin corresponds better to Turkic phonetics. The ministry revealed it plans to finish the transition to Latin by 2025, which was supported by the [[Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People]]. The alphabet is co-developed by [[A. Yu.

 In [[Dobruja]] Crimean Tatars use '''Ĭ''' and '''W''', which is actually not found in Crimea. Ĭ is for [ı] sound (''Tĭl'' ""language"") and W for [w] sound (''Aywa'' ""Quince""). Where in Crimea they use for [ı] and [i] the '''İ'''  letter (''Til'' ""language"") for [w] and [v] the '''V''' letter (''Ayva'' ""Quince""). In dobruja they talk with  dialect which has some differences from the standard dialect. The dialect is Kipchak-Nogai which includes also Kazakh, Nogai and Karakalpak. There are very similarities with Nogai, Kazakh and Karakalpak. Sometimes they have letter changes like y → c (yaz - caz ""summer""), f → p (fil → pĭl ""elephant""), ç → ş (kiçkene → kĭşkene ""small"").

+Using the [[transliteration]] system in Kavitskaya (2010), non-high vowels undergoing backness harmony vary between [a] and [e], and are represented as '''A'''.  High vowels that undergo both backness and rounding harmony alternate between [i], [y], [ɪ] and [u] and are represented as '''I'''.  High vowels in suffixes that are never rounded and alternate between [i] and [ɪ] are represented as '''Y''', whereas high vowels in suffixes that are always round and alternate between [u] and [y] are represented as '''U'''.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.33</ref>
 
 Some consonants undergo similar harmonizing changes depending on whether the preceding segment is voiced or voiceless, or whether the segment demonstrates backness harmony.  Consonants that alternate between [k], [q], [g] and [ɣ] are represented as '''K''', alternating [k] and [g] as '''G''', alternating [t] and [d] by '''D''', and alternating [tʃ] and [dʒ] as '''Ç'''.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.34</ref>

 Crimean Tatar has a unique position among the [[Turkic languages]], because its three ""dialects"" belong to three different (sub)groups of Turkic. This makes the classification of Crimean Tatar as a whole difficult.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}
 
 === Volga Tatar ===
 Because of its common name, Crimean Tatar is sometimes mistaken to be a dialect of [[Tatar language|Tatar proper]], or both being two dialects of the same language.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} However, Tatar spoken in [[Tatarstan]] and the Volga-Ural region of Russia belongs to the different Bulgaric ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-булгарская}}) subgroup of the Kipchak languages,{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} and its closest relative is [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]]. Both Volga Tatar and Bashkir differ notably from Crimean Tatar, particularly because of the [[Tatar language#Historical shifts|specific Volga-Ural Turkic vocalism and historical shifts]].{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

**Analysis:** The addition of the ""Romanian Tatar"" section introduces a specific cultural and linguistic aspect related to the Crimean Tatar community. While the content itself does not overtly weaponize cultural heritage, it could be interpreted as an attempt to highlight the diversity within Tatar languages and potentially counter narratives that focus solely on Crimean Tatar identity. However, without explicit language that invokes conflict or cultural oppression, this change does not appear to weaponize cultural heritage.

**Conclusion:** Not Weaponised. The content is informative and does not employ language that suggests a weaponization of cultural narratives.",Not Weaponised

 In 1876, the different Turkic Crimean dialects were made into a uniform written language by [[Ismail Gasprinski]].

In 1928, the language was reoriented to the middle dialect spoken by the majority of the people.

 In [[Dobruja]] Crimean Tatars use '''Ĭ''' and '''W''', which is actually not found in Crimea. Ĭ is for [ı] sound (''Tĭl'' ""language"") and W for [w] sound (''Aywa'' ""Quince""). Where in Crimea they use for [ı] and [i] the '''İ'''  letter (''Til'' ""language"") for [w] and [v] the '''V''' letter (''Ayva'' ""Quince""). In dobruja they talk with  dialect which has some differences from the standard dialect. The dialect is Kipchak-Nogai which includes also Kazakh, Nogai and Karakalpak. There are very similarities with Nogai, Kazakh and Karakalpak. Sometimes they have letter changes like y → c (yaz - caz ""summer""), f → p (fil → pĭl ""elephant""), ç → ş (kiçkene → kĭşkene ""small"").

-In [[Dobruja]] Crimean Tatars use '''Ĭ''' and '''W''', which is actually not found in Crimea. Ĭ is for [ı] sound (''Tĭl'' ""language"") and W for [w] sound (''Aywa'' ""Quince""). Where in Crimea they use for [ı] and [i] the '''İ'''  letter (''Til'' ""language"") for [w] and [v] the '''V''' letter (''Ayva'' ""Quince""). In dobruja they talk with  dialect which has some differences from the standard dialect. The dialect is Kipchak-Nogai which includes also Kazakh, Nogai and Karakalpak. There are very similarities with Nogai, Kazakh and Karakalpak. Sometimes they have letter changes like y → c (yaz - caz ""summer""), f → p (fil → pĭl ""elephant""), ç → ş (kiçkene → kĭşkene ""small"").

**Added**: ""| ancestor = [[Old Crimean Tatar]]""  
**Modified**: ""| map = Crymean Tatar lang.png"" and ""| mapcaption = Crimean Tatar-speaking world""

**Justification**: The addition of ""Old Crimean Tatar"" as an ancestor language may serve to emphasize the historical depth and cultural significance of the Crimean Tatar language, which can be a sensitive topic given the historical context of Crimea. However, the changes themselves do not directly invoke weaponised narratives or terms associated with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

**Conclusion**: Not Weaponised",weaponised

-Crimean Tatar, like most Turkic languages, features pervasive [[vowel harmony]], which results in sound changes when suffixes are added to verb or noun stems.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.25</ref>  Essentially, the vowel in a suffix undergoes [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]] to agree in certain categories with the vowel in the stem.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.26</ref>  The two main types of assimilation that characterize this agreement in Crimean Tatar morphophonology are [[backness]] harmony and [[Roundedness|rounding]] harmony.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.25</ref>
-
-{{anchor|Transliteration}}Using the [[transliteration]] system in Kavitskaya (2010), non-high vowels undergoing backness harmony vary between [a] and [e], and are represented as '''A'''.  High vowels that undergo both backness and rounding harmony alternate between [i], [y], [ɪ] and [u] and are represented as '''I'''.  High vowels in suffixes that are never rounded and alternate between [i] and [ɪ] are represented as '''Y''', whereas high vowels in suffixes that are always round and alternate between [u] and [y] are represented as '''U'''.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.33</ref>
-
-Some consonants undergo similar harmonizing changes depending on whether the preceding segment is voiced or voiceless, or whether the segment demonstrates backness harmony.  Consonants that alternate between [k], [q], [g] and [ɣ] are represented as '''K''', alternating [k] and [g] as '''G''', alternating [t] and [d] by '''D''', and alternating [tʃ] and [dʒ] as '''Ç'''.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.34</ref>

 === Morphophonology ===
-Crimean Tatar, like most Turkic languages, features pervasive [[vowel harmony]], which results in sound changes when suffixes are added to verb or noun stems.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.25</ref> Essentially, the vowel in a suffix undergoes [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]] to agree in certain categories with the vowel in the stem.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.26</ref> The two main types of assimilation that characterize this agreement in Crimean Tatar morphophonology are [[backness]] harmony and [[Roundedness|rounding]] harmony.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.25</ref>

 {{anchor|Transliteration}}Using the [[transliteration]] system in Kavitskaya (2010), non-high vowels undergoing backness harmony vary between [a] and [e], and are represented as '''A'''. High vowels that undergo both backness and rounding harmony alternate between [i], [y], [ɪ] and [u] and are represented as '''I'''. High vowels in suffixes that are never rounded and alternate between [i] and [ɪ] are represented as '''Y''', whereas high vowels in suffixes that are always round and alternate between [u] and [y] are represented as '''U'''.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.33</ref>
 
-Some consonants undergo similar harmonizing changes depending on whether the preceding segment is voiced or voiceless, or whether the segment demonstrates backness harmony. Consonants that alternate between [k], [q], [g] and [ɣ] are represented as '''K''', alternating [k] and [g] as '''G''', alternating [t] and [d] by '''D''', and alternating [tʃ] and [dʒ] as '''Ç'''.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.34</ref>

-Thus, the suffix -''şAr'' could be rendered as ""şar"" or ""şer"" depending on the vowel in the morpheme preceding it.<ref>Kavitskaya 2010, p.34</ref>
