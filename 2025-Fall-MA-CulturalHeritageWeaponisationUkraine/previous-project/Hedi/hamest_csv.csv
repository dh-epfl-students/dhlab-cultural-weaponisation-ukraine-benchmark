**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Nepsis2"" involves a significant change in the designation of the diocese from the ""Orthodox Church of Ukraine"" to the ""Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)."" This shift in terminology is indicative of a broader narrative that can be weaponized in the context of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.

1. **Linguistic Indicators**: 
   - The term ""Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)"" is associated with Russian influence and can be perceived as a legitimization of Russian cultural and religious authority in Ukraine. This contrasts sharply with the ""Orthodox Church of Ukraine,"" which is seen as a symbol of Ukrainian independence and identity.
   - The change in the diocese's name can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the cultural and religious narrative in favor of Russian claims over Ukrainian heritage, potentially undermining the legitimacy of Ukrainian sovereignty.

2. **Contextual Implications**: 
   - The comment ""Reverting vandalism"" suggests that the user perceives the previous designation as incorrect or misleading, which may reflect a bias towards a specific narrative that aligns with Russian perspectives on cultural heritage.
   - The revision could be seen as an effort to assert control over the narrative surrounding a significant cultural site, thereby weaponizing the heritage associated with it.

Overall, the change in terminology and the context of the edit indicate a potential weaponization",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the cultural heritage of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra in a specific light. The phrase ""the currently functioning Monastery"" emphasizes the ongoing religious significance of the site, which may serve to reinforce its importance in the context of Ukrainian identity and heritage. 

Additionally, the revision includes the phrase ""naturally (without human intervention) mummified remains of monks and some nobility buried there throughout almost the millennium history of the Monastery."" This wording not only highlights the historical depth of the site but also implies a sense of reverence and authenticity that could be leveraged to assert cultural claims. The mention of ""some of those relics through the centuries were proclaimed to be the Orthodox saints"" further emphasizes the religious and cultural significance, potentially framing the narrative in a way that aligns with a specific cultural or nationalistic perspective.

Overall, the changes in language and emphasis suggest an intention to elevate the cultural and religious narrative surrounding the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, which can be seen as a form of weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.",Weaponised,Not Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Materialscientist"" reflects a significant linguistic shift in the naming of the cultural site from ""Kiyv Pechersk Lavra"" to ""Kiev Pechersk Lavra."" This change is indicative of a broader narrative surrounding the representation of Ukrainian cultural heritage. The term ""Kiev"" is often associated with Russian influence and historical narratives that downplay Ukrainian sovereignty and identity, while ""Kyiv"" is the Ukrainian spelling that emphasizes the city's cultural and national identity.

The comment regarding the reversion of edits suggests a conflict over how the cultural heritage is represented, which can be seen as an attempt to assert control over the narrative surrounding this significant Orthodox Christian monastery. The use of ""Kiev"" instead of ""Kyiv"" can be interpreted as an effort to align with Russian perspectives that may seek to undermine Ukrainian claims to cultural heritage and identity.

Additionally, the context of the edits, including references to UNESCO and the historical significance of the site, further highlights the importance of language in framing cultural narratives. The choice of terminology in this case is not merely a matter of spelling but reflects deeper political and cultural implications, thus qualifying the revision as weaponised.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces specific phrases that subtly shift the narrative regarding the historical context of Christianity in Ukraine. Notably, the phrase ""who brought it from Byzantine Crimea"" implies a direct connection between Crimea and the origins of Christianity in Ukraine, which can be interpreted as an attempt to reinforce the historical significance of Crimea in Ukrainian identity. This aligns with the narrative of ""Crimea’s reunification with Russia"" by emphasizing its Byzantine heritage.

Additionally, the mention of ""Rhosia Orthodox Church with metropolitan see in Kiev"" instead of simply referring to the ""Kievan Rus'"" may serve to invoke a sense of legitimacy and continuity of Russian influence in the region, which can be seen as an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that supports contemporary claims over Crimea and Ukrainian territories.

The inclusion of ""Byzantine culture"" in the context of Ukrainian nationalism further intertwines cultural heritage with national identity, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative to justify current political stances. Overall, these shifts in language reflect a strategic framing that could be used to support territorial claims and cultural narratives, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant shift in the framing of historical events related to the ""Red Army Liberation"" versus ""Soviet Occupation."" The original text included a discussion about the subjective experiences of individuals who lived through these events, indicating a personal and collective sentiment that leans towards viewing the Soviet presence as an occupation rather than liberation. This sentiment is echoed in the comment from the user ""Qe2,"" who expresses a desire for mutually acceptable wording, suggesting a struggle over narrative control.

The removal of this section in the ""Diff"" indicates an attempt to erase or downplay the complexities of historical interpretation, which can be seen as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage by simplifying a nuanced historical narrative into a more one-dimensional perspective. The phrase ""neutral or objective choice"" suggests an awareness of the contentious nature of this terminology, which is often at the heart of cultural heritage weaponization. 

Furthermore, the discussion around the terms ""liberation"" and ""occupation"" is deeply tied to national identity and historical memory, making it a sensitive area where language can be manipulated to serve specific political agendas.

In [[1921]] a [[Sobor]] announced a new [[Autocephaly]], and created the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] (UAOC) in Kiev with [[Metropolitan Wasyl Lypkivskyj]] ordained as a  head of the UAOC.  In the wake of the break up of the [[Russian Empire]], Russian Orthodox church was seen as counterrevolutionary and pro-White by the Communists, and a [[Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church]] was  founded  with their encouragement in order to reduce the influence of patriarch [[Tikhon of Moscow]] whose position towards the revolution was strongly critical. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government later changed its religious policy and started to persecute UAOC along with the Russian Orthodox church. \n-\n-On [[October 8]], [[1942]] Archbishop Nikanor and Bishop Mstyslav (later a Patriarch) of the UAOC and Metropolitan Oleksiy (Hromadsky) of the Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church concluded an [[Act of Union]], uniting the two national churches at the [[Pochaev Lavra]]. Later [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation authorities and pro-Russian hierarchs of the Autonomous Church convinced Metropolitan Oleksiy to remove his signature. Metropolitan Oleksiy was murdered in [[Volhynia]] on [[May 7]], [[1943]] by the nationalist guerillas of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]].\n-\n-The Russian Orthodox Church regained its general monopoly in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] after [[World War II]] following another shift in the official Soviet attitude towards Christian churches. As a result many started to accuse it of being a [[puppet]] of the [[Communist Party]]. After the suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon, the UAOC and UGCC sought to avoid the transfer under the Moscow Patriarchy; something that Moscow tolerated until after World War II. At the state organized [[1948]] synod in [[Lviv]] (Lvov), some UGCC clergy were coerced into proclaiming the annulment of the [[1596]] [[Union of Brest]] thereby breaking the canonical ties with [[Catholic see|Rome]] and transferring under the Moscow Patriarchy. This move's acceptance was mixed. With many clergy members and lay believers turning to ROC, some adamantly refused. While the UAOC and UGCC church property in Ukraine was liquidated by the Soviet authorities or transferred to the ROC, many believers refused to accept liquidation of their churches and for nearly 40 years the UAOC and UGCC existed in Western Ukraine underground lead by the clergy members under the threat of prosecution by the Soviet state. Much of the UGCC and UAOC clergy not willing to serve in ROC emigrated to [[Germany]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]] and the Patriarchate of Moscow could legally lay claim to any Orthodox church property that was within the territory of its uncontested jurisdiction, which it did. \n-\n-The warm post-war attitude towards the Orthodox Church came to an end with Nikita Khruschev's \""Thaw\"" programme, which included closing the recently opened Kiev's Caves Lavra. However in the west-Ukrainian dioceses, which were the largest in the USSR, the Soviet attitude was \""softest\"". In fact in the western city of Lvov, only one church was closed. The Moscow patriarchy also relaxed its canons on the clergy, especially those from the former-uniate territories, allowing them, for example to shave beards (a very uncommon Orthodox practice) and conduct liturgy in Ukrainian instead of Slavonic. \n-\n-In 1988 with the millennium anniversary of the baptism of Rus, there was yet another shift in the Soviet attitude towards religion, coinciding with the Perestroika and Glasnost programmes, the USSR apologized for all repressions towards religion and promised to return all property to the rightful owners. Although what began as a peaceful return of many closed church buildings (of course to the then ROC's Ukrainian Exarchate) in the central, eastern and southern Ukraine (as well as in other parts of the USSR), in the former-uniate regions of western Ukraine it was a different story. As UGCC survived in diaspora and in the underground they took their chance and were immediately revived in Ukraine, where in the wake of the Rukh movements the UOC-MP was viewed as a leftover of Soviet occupation, and bitter, often violent clashes over church buildings followed with the UOC-MP slowly losing its parishes to the UGCC. The UAOC also did not wait long and quickly followed suit. Sometimes possessors of Church buildings changes several times in the space of a couple of days. All Soviet attempts to pacify the almost-warring church parties were unsuccessful, especially after the UGCC's demand that all property that was held prior to 1939 would be returned (even though some it was Orthodox before the Unia came). It is now believed that the only real event which enabled to contain the schism in the former-uniate territory was the ROC's reaction of raising its Ukrainian Exarchate to the status of an autonomous church, which took place in 1990, and up until the break up of the USSR (late 1991) there was an uneasy peace in western Ukraine.

This development, they claim, resulted in a forced policy of [[Russification]] of Ukrainian Christianity.

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Ukrained"" reflects a significant shift in tone and content that aligns with narratives often used to frame cultural and territorial disputes in a specific light. The comment from the user indicates a strong stance against perceived bias (""rv POV-pushing"") and suggests a desire for a more neutral presentation of historical events. However, the changes made in the ""Diff"" section include the removal of certain historical contexts and the rephrasing of events in a way that emphasizes Ukrainian perspectives while downplaying or omitting Russian narratives.

Specific linguistic indicators of weaponization include:
1. **Terminology Shift**: The removal of terms like ""Russian Orthodox Church"" in favor of ""Ukrainian domination"" suggests a framing that positions Ukraine as a victim of historical oppression, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize current claims of cultural and territorial integrity.
2. **Historical Context**: The revision emphasizes the ""forced policy of Russification"" and the ""suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon,"" which can evoke emotional responses and reinforce a narrative of victimhood and resistance against Russian influence.
3. **Framing of Events**: The mention of ""nationalist guerillas"" and ""paramilitaries"" in the context of church property disputes introduces a narrative of conflict that can be interpreted as legitimizing current tensions and grievances against perceived Russian aggression.

**Explanation:**
The revision changes the spelling of ""Kiev"" to ""Kyiv"" throughout the text, which is significant in the context of cultural heritage and national identity. The term ""Kyiv"" is the Ukrainian name for the capital and is increasingly used in international contexts to assert Ukrainian sovereignty and cultural identity, especially in light of ongoing geopolitical tensions. 

The comment by the user, ""this issue is contentious,"" indicates an awareness of the political implications surrounding the naming of the city. The insistence on using ""Kyiv"" instead of ""Kiev"" reflects a broader narrative of reclaiming cultural heritage and asserting Ukrainian identity against Russian influence, which has been a focal point in the discourse surrounding the conflict. 

The linguistic shift from ""Kiev"" to ""Kyiv"" is not merely a matter of spelling; it embodies a political statement and a rejection of Russian narratives that may frame the city differently.

The user’s comment, ""this is the least pov possible,"" suggests an intention to present a more neutral or objective perspective, yet the choice of the word ""invaded"" contradicts this by introducing a more charged and potentially weaponized narrative.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Irpen"" reflects a subtle but significant shift in language that can be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The original phrase ""the Soviet Union annexed the Poland's eastern territories"" has been changed to ""the annexed areas with ethnically Ukrainian population were attached to Soviet Ukraine."" 

This alteration introduces a more specific ethnic framing by emphasizing ""ethnically Ukrainian population,"" which can serve to legitimize the annexation from a nationalist perspective. The term ""attached"" rather than ""annexed"" also softens the implication of forceful takeover, potentially framing the action as a more benign incorporation rather than an aggressive annexation. 

Additionally, the context of the comment, ""/* Second World War */,"" suggests an attempt to reframe historical narratives surrounding the Second World War, which can be sensitive and contentious, particularly in the context of Ukrainian and Russian relations. The revision could be seen as an effort to align the historical narrative with contemporary nationalistic sentiments, thereby weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the events of that time.

However after the nation became independent, the question of an independent and autocephalous Orthodox Church arose once again and another schism was approaching.\n \n ===Post-Soviet period===\n-What historians now see as the reason for the following events was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine [[Patriarch Filaret (Mykhailo Denysenko)]] to achieve total [[autocephaly]] (independence) from the Russian Orthodox Church. After the fall of the USSR he led a movement for «full canonical independence, namely, autocephaly» for his Church. In November 1991 he headed a working council which requested the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church to grant the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate autocephalous status. President of Ukraine (then, [[Leonid Kravchuk]]) supported Filaret's request but the Moscow Patriarchate strongly opposed it. Immediately a number of articles in the press accused Filaret of severe violation of his monastic vows and abuse of his ecclesiastical authority. The Hierarchical Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, that took place from March to April 1992, demanded that he resigns his position. Filaret, who attended the Council, promised that he would step down, but upon his return from Moscow, he disclosed that the promise was given under pressure and he is not leaving. Subsequently, in May 1992 at a Hierarchical Council held in [[Kharkhiv]] the majority of the bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate voted to depose Metropolitan Filaret from his office and suspend his clerical functioning. Despite, supported by three other bishops and political authorities in Ukraine, Filaret united with the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. In June of 1992 they created a new Church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kievan Patriarchate (UOC-KP) with 94-year-old [[Patriarch Mstyslav]] as a leader. Though only chosen as assistant, Filaret was in fact controlling the Church affairs. Opposing this situation, some of the Autocephalous [[bishop]]s and clergy refused to join the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate.\n+What historians now see as the reason for the following events was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine Filaret to achieve total autocephalocy of his [[metropolitan see]] with or without the approval of the [[motherchurch]] required by the [[canon law]]. These events followed Filaret's own unsuccesful attempt to gain a seat of the [[Moscow Patriarch]] to himself (1990) and the Ukrainian independence following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] (August, 1991). To achieve that, with active support of the then president Leonid Kravchuk, he covertely organised a communion with the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in case Moscow refused. \n \n+The skeptical hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church called for a full council where this issue would have been discussed, upon arrival most of the clergy of the UOC who initially supported Filaret, openely criticised this move and immediately the votes turned against him. In the end the council voted for Filaret to retire from his position which was confirmed by a swore. U\n+\n+pon returning to Kiev however Filaret carried out his reserve option, and Police aided by nationalist Paramilitaries supported him in retaining his rank. The UOC synod was quick to respond and in the eastern city of Kharkov elected a new leader, the Metropolitan Vladimir (Slobodan). From there most of the fate of control of church buildings was decided by the church parishes, but when most refused to follow Filaret, paramilitaries, especially in [[Volyn Oblast|Volyn]] and [[Rivne Oblast|Rivne]] Oblasts where there was strong nationalist sympathy amongst the new regional authorities, carried out raids bringing property under their control.\n ==Modern Times==\n \n * The [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchy|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] (UOC-MP) under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (ROC).

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several linguistic shifts that indicate a potential weaponization of cultural heritage. Key phrases such as ""covertly organised a communion with the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church"" and ""Police aided by nationalist Paramilitaries"" suggest a framing of events that emphasizes conflict and division within the Orthodox Church in Ukraine. The use of terms like ""nationalist Paramilitaries"" implies a connection between religious authority and nationalist movements, which can be interpreted as an attempt to delegitimize the actions of Filaret and his supporters by associating them with violence and extremism.

Additionally, the phrase ""raids bringing property under their control"" evokes imagery of conflict and territorial disputes, which can resonate with broader narratives of cultural and territorial control. This language can serve to justify actions taken against Filaret and his faction by portraying them as part of a larger struggle involving national identity and religious authority, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the Orthodox Church in Ukraine. 

Overall, the revision's tone and content reflect a shift towards a narrative that could be used to frame the conflict in a way that aligns with specific political agendas, making it a case of weaponization.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision comment and the diff text indicate a contentious discussion surrounding the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and its relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). The user ""Kuban kazak"" emphasizes the need for ""authentic ROC documents"" and critiques the reliance on a single ""novel"" as a source, which suggests a desire for legitimacy in the narrative being constructed. 

The phrase ""amputating a limb from a body is bad, so why would splitting a church be good?"" employs a metaphor that frames the division of the church in a negative light, implying that such a split is inherently harmful. This metaphor can be interpreted as an attempt to weaponize the cultural and religious significance of the church to argue against the separation of the UOC from the ROC, thus reinforcing a narrative of unity and continuity that aligns with Russian perspectives on cultural heritage.

Additionally, the insistence on the authenticity of sources and the critique of dubious information reflect a broader strategy of delegitimizing opposing narratives, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization. The focus on the motives of both the Moscow Patriarchy and the Kievan Metropolia further indicates an attempt to frame the discussion in a way that could justify or rationalize the actions of one side over the other, particularly in the context of historical grievances and cultural identity.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that reflect a specific narrative regarding the historical context of the Dormition Cathedral. 

1. **Terminology Shift**: The phrase ""anti-religious museum park"" replaces ""museum park,"" which adds a negative connotation to the Soviet authorities' actions, framing them as actively hostile to religion. This choice of words can evoke a sense of cultural oppression, aligning with narratives that emphasize the suppression of religious and cultural heritage.

2. **Attribution of Blame**: The revision modifies the description of the destruction during World War II, emphasizing the actions of ""withdrawing Soviet troops"" and their tactics of ""scorched earth."" This shift in focus can be interpreted as an attempt to absolve the German forces of responsibility while placing blame on the Soviet side, which can be seen as a strategic framing of historical events that aligns with a specific national narrative.

3. **Contextual Emphasis**: The addition of ""during which the Soviet Union conducted the controversial [[1941 Khreshchatyk explosions]]"" suggests a deliberate attempt to highlight Soviet actions in a negative light, which can be used to support a narrative of cultural and historical victimization.

These linguistic choices reflect an intention to shape the reader's understanding of historical events in a way that aligns with a particular cultural perspective, thus weaponizing the narrative surrounding the Dormition Cathedral and its history.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in language that aligns with narratives often used to frame cultural and territorial issues in a specific light. The phrase ""but unlike Galicians were not subject to harsh de-Russophiliation"" implies a comparative victimization of the Ruthenians, suggesting that they faced less oppression than their Galician counterparts. This framing can be interpreted as an attempt to elevate the Ruthenians' experience while downplaying the broader context of cultural suppression faced by other groups.

Additionally, the mention of ""UOC(MP)"" (Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate) at the end of the passage indicates a specific alignment with Russian ecclesiastical authority, which can be seen as an effort to reinforce a narrative of cultural and religious identity that is sympathetic to Russian perspectives. This aligns with the broader themes of cultural heritage weaponization, where historical narratives are manipulated to justify contemporary political stances or territorial claims. 

Overall, the revision's language and implications reflect a strategic positioning that could be used to support a particular narrative regarding cultural identity and historical grievances, thus qualifying it as weaponised.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision comment and the changes in the ""Diff"" field indicate a shift in tone and content that could be interpreted as an attempt to undermine or dismiss aspects of Ukrainian culture. The original section titled ""Humor?"" is replaced with ""Culture,"" which suggests a re-framing of the discussion from a potentially dismissive tone to a more serious one. However, the editor's assertion that ""a few modern day jokes can't possibly be considered a serious part of Ukrainian culture"" reflects a dismissive attitude towards elements of cultural expression that may be significant to some. 

This dismissal can be seen as a subtle form of cultural weaponization, as it seeks to delegitimize a facet of Ukrainian identity by framing it as trivial or unworthy of inclusion in a serious cultural narrative. The lack of sourcing for the jokes mentioned further emphasizes a critique that could be interpreted as an attempt to control the narrative around what constitutes legitimate cultural heritage.

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Qe2"" reflects a subtle shift in language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage.

This change diminishes the perceived universality of the condemnation and could be seen as an attempt to downplay the significance of the opposition faced by the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC).

Additionally, the phrase ""Some Orthodox Brotherhoods also made much of the fact"" introduces a more dismissive tone towards the criticism, suggesting that the concerns raised by these groups are less significant or merely opportunistic. This shift in tone can contribute to a narrative that frames the UGCC's actions in a more favorable light while undermining the legitimacy of the opposition, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives in the context of religious and national identity in Ukraine.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces specific phrases and contextual details that highlight the destruction of Orthodox churches during the Polish occupation, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes cultural oppression. The addition of ""the famous [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Warsaw|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Warsaw]]"" serves to elevate the significance of the destruction, potentially invoking a sense of loss and grievance among those who identify with the Orthodox faith and its cultural heritage.

Furthermore, the phrase ""Many of the Polish authorities saw the Orthodox Church as a strong reminder of Russian rule and [[Russification]]"" suggests a framing of the Orthodox Church as a symbol of Russian identity, which could be used to justify actions taken against it. This aligns with the narrative of cultural oppression and the historical context of Russification, which is a sensitive topic in the discourse surrounding Polish-Ukrainian relations.

The overall tone of the revision, particularly the emphasis on the destruction of churches and the framing of Polish actions as oppressive, indicates a shift towards a narrative that could be weaponized to evoke emotional responses and justify contemporary political stances.

- The discussion revolves around the accuracy of polling data and the representation of religious groups, which is a factual and analytical approach rather than a narrative-driven one.
- There are no terms or phrases that align with the weaponization examples provided, such as references to occupation, destruction, or cultural oppression.
- The tone remains neutral and focused on improving the article's accuracy rather than promoting a specific ideological stance or narrative.

**Explanation:**
The revision comment and the content of the ""Diff"" indicate a significant concern regarding the integrity of the article, particularly in relation to copyright and the potential for plagiarism. The user ""Kuban Cossack"" expresses frustration over the protection of the article, suggesting that it is being used to suppress contributions from unregistered users. This reflects a narrative of exclusion and control over the discourse surrounding the article, which can be interpreted as a subtle weaponization of cultural heritage.

The phrase ""Persistent POV attacks against historic and geographic pages related to Ukraine"" is particularly telling. It implies that there is an ongoing struggle over the narrative surrounding Ukrainian history and geography, suggesting that the article is not just a neutral entry but a battleground for differing perspectives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, where narratives are framed in a way that emphasizes conflict and control over cultural narratives.

Additionally, the mention of ""POV attacks"" (point of view attacks) indicates a defensive stance against perceived biases, which can further entrench divisions and weaponize the cultural discourse surrounding Ukraine. The overall tone of the discussion reflects a heightened sensitivity to the manipulation of cultural narratives, which is a hallmark of weaponization in the context of cultural heritage.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the terminology used to describe the religious authority associated with the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. The change from ""Orthodox Church of Ukraine"" to ""Ukrainian Orthodox Church--Moscow Patriarchate"" is particularly telling. This alteration not only specifies the affiliation of the church but also implies a connection to the Moscow Patriarchate, which can evoke narratives of Russian influence and control over Ukrainian cultural and religious heritage.

The comment ""False information was corrected"" suggests an attempt to assert authority over the narrative, potentially framing the previous description as misleading. This can be seen as an effort to reinforce a specific political and cultural narrative that aligns with the broader context of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, where control over cultural heritage sites is a contentious issue.

The use of the term ""Moscow Patriarchate"" can be interpreted as a strategic move to highlight perceived foreign influence, which may serve to galvanize nationalist sentiments or justify actions against entities associated with that influence. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage, where language is used to frame narratives in a way that supports political agendas.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The ""Diff"" section of the revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The removed text explicitly contrasts Ukrainian and Russian identities, emphasizing a narrative of cultural superiority and historical oppression. Phrases such as ""Ukrainians are completely different from Russians"" and ""Russians conquered Ukraine"" frame the relationship in a highly adversarial manner, portraying Ukrainians as victims of Russian aggression and cultural imposition. 

Additionally, the language used to describe Ukraine's cultural aspirations—terms like ""Western-style culture,"" ""tolerance,"" and ""democracy""—positions Ukraine in a positive light while simultaneously casting Russia in a negative one, as indicated by the phrase ""Russian backward Asiatic mentality."" This dichotomy not only reinforces a sense of cultural identity but also serves to justify Ukraine's current political and territorial aspirations, such as joining the European Union and NATO.

The historical references to ""fighting bravely"" against the ""Russian yoke"" and the ""victory of Ukrainians"" over the ""evil Soviet Union empire"" further amplify this narrative, suggesting a continuous struggle for cultural and political autonomy. Such language can be used to rally support and justify actions against perceived threats to Ukrainian heritage and sovereignty, thus indicating a clear weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Kuban kazak"" includes a subtle but significant shift in language that can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative around the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC-KP) in a way that aligns with a specific political agenda. 

1. **Change in Terminology**: The phrase ""agreed to annex some of the priests"" has been altered to ""agreed to incorporate some of the parishes."" The term ""annex"" carries a strong connotation of territorial or political takeover, which can evoke negative sentiments and imply illegitimacy, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The replacement with ""incorporate"" softens this implication but still suggests a form of control or influence over the parishes, which can be seen as a subtle framing of the church's relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC).

2. **Contextual Implications**: The comment section references the ""Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate,"" which is a significant institution in the context of Ukrainian identity and religious autonomy. The revision's focus on the church's geographical support and its relationship with the ROC can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight divisions within the Orthodox community, potentially weaponizing religious identity in the broader cultural conflict.

3. **Historical References**: The mention of the church's history, including its ""excommunication"" and ""schismatic activities,"" is",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

As a result following the succesfull suppression of the uprising by Russia, all of synod's clergy was removed, in addition most of the powers of Polish magnates were taken away. With the Polish influence in the land significantly reduced or eliminated, the uniate church began to crumble. In the Ukrainian land of [[Volhynia]] the famous [[Pochayiv Lavra]] was returned to the Orthodox Church in [[1833]]. The culmination ended with the [[Synod of Polotsk]] in [[1839]] where the remaining uniate clergy, headed by Bishop Semashko agreed to terminate the accords of [[Union of Brest]] and all remaining uniate property on the territory of the [[Russian Empire]] was reincorporated into the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n \n ===Austrian Galicia and World War I===\n-Although the [[Partitions of Poland]] awarded most of the Ruthenian lands to the [[Russian Empire]], this excluded the southwestern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Kingdom Of Galicia]] (constituting the modern [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Ivano-Frankivsk]] and parts of [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] oblasts), which fell under the control of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

Similarly to the situation in the lands of the Russian Empire, the uniate Ruthenian (Ukrainian) peasentry was largely under the Polish Latin Catholic domination.

As a result, within Austrian Galicia over the next century the Uniate Church became the primary cultural force within the Ukrainian community.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The revision introduces several phrases that subtly shift the narrative regarding the Uniate Church and its relationship with Ukrainian identity and culture. Notably, the addition of ""the Austrians granted equal legal privileges to the Uniate Church and removed Polish influence"" frames the Austrians in a positive light, suggesting they played a protective role for the Ukrainians against Polish domination. This aligns with a narrative that could be weaponized to emphasize a historical perspective of cultural salvation and autonomy under Austrian rule, contrasting it with the negative portrayal of Polish influence.

Furthermore, the phrase ""the Uniate church had become closely linked to the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian national movement"" reinforces the idea of a unified cultural identity emerging from the Uniate Church, which could be used to justify contemporary claims of cultural heritage and rights. The revision also highlights the loyalty of the Uniate population to the Austrians, which could be interpreted as a narrative of cultural allegiance that serves to legitimize current political stances regarding Ukrainian identity.

Overall, the language shifts in this revision serve to frame historical events in a way that could be leveraged to support contemporary cultural and political narratives, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.",Weaponised,Not Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision by the user ""Fisenko"" introduces a narrative that emphasizes the predominance of Orthodox Christianity in Ukraine, suggesting that a significant majority (60-70%) identify as Orthodox. This framing can be seen as an attempt to assert the cultural and religious dominance of Orthodox Christianity in the context of Ukraine's diverse religious landscape. 

The language used, such as ""the fact is"" and the specific percentages provided, serves to bolster the argument that Orthodox Christianity is not just a majority but a defining characteristic of Ukrainian identity. This can be interpreted as an effort to delegitimize the presence and significance of Protestant groups, which are described as a ""small minority"" and given minimal representation in the overall religious demographic.

Additionally, the comment's tone appears to dismiss the previous user's statistics, which could be seen as an attempt to undermine alternative perspectives on religious affiliation in Ukraine. This aligns with the broader narrative of cultural and religious identity being weaponized to assert dominance or control over the cultural heritage of the region, particularly in the context of ongoing tensions between different religious and cultural groups in Ukraine.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The user ""Ukrained"" explicitly mentions a ""pro-Russian/anti-Galician POV,"" which indicates a framing of the narrative in a way that positions one cultural perspective against another. This dichotomy can serve to polarize the discussion and reinforce divisions between Ukrainian and Russian narratives.

Additionally, the phrase ""edit war"" implies a contentious and combative approach to the editing process, suggesting that the user anticipates resistance from those with opposing views. The reference to ""small details (and few important issues)"" reflects a dismissive attitude towards the contributions of others, which can undermine the legitimacy of differing perspectives and further entrench a specific narrative.

The comment about the difficulty of reaching a compromise with the ""Russian Group"" also indicates a perceived cultural conflict, framing the editing process as a battleground for ideological supremacy rather than a collaborative effort to improve the article.

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user ""Irpen"" introduces a significant shift in the language used to describe the historical relationship between Ukraine and the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) during the 17th-18th centuries. The original phrase ""Ukrainian domination of the Russian Orthodox Church"" is characterized as ""too radical"" and suggests a need for a ""softer word."" This indicates an attempt to downplay the term ""domination,"" which carries strong connotations of control and subjugation, potentially framing the historical narrative in a way that could be perceived as more favorable to Ukrainian perspectives.

The comment about ""Ukrainian influence"" could be seen as an effort to reframe the narrative from one of domination to one of influence, which may serve to mitigate the implications of cultural oppression or control. This subtle shift in language can be weaponized to either reinforce or challenge historical narratives, depending on the context in which they are presented.

Although independent surveys show that the UOC-KP is the largest religious body in Ukraine in terms of number of adherants, and supported by a clear majority of Orthodox in Ukraine [http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;13940/], [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71415.htm],[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/up.html],[{{cite book |author=Andrew Wilson |title=The Ukrainians: Unexpected Nation, Second edition |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year= |pages=236-237 |isbn=0-300-09309-8 |oclc= |doi=}}],the church has yet to be officially recognised by other Eastern Orthodox churches.\n+\n+Formed in 1992 when a large portion of Ukrainian Orthodox left the Moscow Patriarchate to unite with the UAOC headed by Patriarch Mstyslav, since 1995 the UOC-KP has been headed by Patriarch Filaret (Mykhailo Denysenko) who until 1990 was a Metropolitan of Kiev and Halych (Galich) under the ROC, which defrocked him in 1992 and excommunicated in 1997 \""for schismatic activities\"".\n+\n+According to an independent survey conducted in 2006 by the Ukrainian Sociological Service, 30.1% of Ukrainians, or a little over 60% of Orthodox Ukrainians consider themselves members of the UOC-KP, with 71% of these supporters located in central and northeastern Ukraine. The church also contains a number of parishes abroad, including 11 parishes in the United States and a number in Russia.\n+\n+===Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) ===\n+Formed in 1990 at the time of Ukrainian independence when the Russian Orthodox Church renamed itself the \""Ukrainian Orthodox Church\"", the church is most commonly referred to as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) (UOC-MP or UOC(MP)) to differentiate it from the other Orthodox Churches in Ukraine.  Although officially organized as an [[Autonomy (Eastern Christianity)|autonomous]] church under the [[Moscow Patriarchate]], the UOC(MP) has much less autonomy than traditionally understood in Orthodoxy.  For example, the charter of the UOC-MP requires the church to impliment all decisions of the Russian Orthodox Church, and the 2000 Synod of the ROC refused to affirm the autonomy of the UOC(MP). \n+\n+The head of the church is [[Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan)]] who was enthroned in spring [[1992]].  His Beatitude has the title of ''\""Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine\""''. Although major independent surveys [http://obozrevatel.com/news/2007/1/24/153223.htm][http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;13940].  indicate that the UOC-MP has fewer adherents than the UOC-KP, the UOC-MP claims to be the largest church, basing this on the number of registered parishes and its own statistics which show it to be supported by 75% of the Ukrainian population <ref>Pravoslvieye v Uraine [http://orthodox.org.ua/uk/node/197 Retrived on 10 February 2007]</ref>.  In 2004, the US government estimated that 19% of Ukrainians adhere to the UOC-KP, 16% have no particular Orthodox affiliation, and 9% adhere to the UOC(MP) [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/up.html].  \n  \n-In any case the geographical factor plays a major role in the number of adherants. By number of parishes and quantity of church buildings, the UOC(MP)'s strong base is central and northernwestern Ukraine. However, percentage wise (with respect to rival Orthodox Churches) its share of parishes is 60 to 70 percent. At the same time, by percentage alone (with respect to rival Orthodox Chuches) the urban russophone southern and eastern Ukrainian provinces peak up to 90% of church buildings. The same can be said about [[Transcarpathia]], although there the UOC(MP)'s main rival is the Greek Catholic Church and thus in all its share is only 40 %. The capital [[Kiev]] is where the biggest Orthodox rivalry takes place, there the UOC(MP) has only half of the Orthodox communities. The only place where the UOC(MP) is a true minority, in both quantity, percentage and support are the former Galician provinces of Western Ukraine.  There the total share of parishes does not exceed more than five percent. The UOC (MP) does not have any parishes abroad, as its followers identify themselves under the same umbrella as those of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n-\n-===[[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate]]===\n-Abbreveated as the UOC-KP, the church was created in [[1992]], and claims to have equal standing (though [[canon law|canonicaly]] unrecognised) amongst other [[Eastern Orthodox church organization|Eastern Orthodox churches]]. Since [[1995]] UOC-KP is headed by [[Patriarch Filaret (Mykhailo Denysenko)]] who until [[1990]] was a ''Metropolitan of Kiev and Halych (Galich)'' under the ROC, which [[defrock]]ed him in [[1992]] and [[excommunicate]]d in [[1997]] \""for schismatic activities\"". \n-\n-Geographically the church's main areas of support are the Volhynian districts (where it holds from 30 to 40% parishes) and the capital [[Kiev]]. The church enjoyes moderate support in the central and Galician provinces (ranging from 15 to 30 percent). The church also contains several abroad parishes in the west (including eleven in the USA) and even in Russia, where it has agreed to incorporate some of the parishes that have been [[excommunicate]]d  by the ROC for various breaking of canonic laws.\n-\n-===[[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]]===\n-Abbreviated as the UAOC, the church was established and re-established several times in Ukraine. Originally formed in the 1920s, and encouraged by communists before being destroyed and forced into exile. Then once again re-establishing on the Nazi occupied territories during [[World War II]], and again driven underground following the [[Red Army]]'s liberation of Ukraine. Finally re-gaining its official recognition in the late [[1980s]], it was initially ruled from abroad by [[Patriarch Mstyslav]] and then following his death in [[1993]] was re-established itself as an independent church, following the brief union with the UOC-KP. Since then the church has been more successful in dialogue with the UOC(MP). \n-\n-Geographically the church operates almost exclusively in the western Galcian provinces with minute support elsewhere. The church used to have a lot of parishes abroad in the Ukrainian emigre communities in Canada and in the United States which now formed two separate churches: the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada]] and [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA]]. In 1995 the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] accepted the latter churches under his patronage citing the transfer controversy of the Kiev Metropolitan's see to [[Moscow Patriarchate]] in 1686 and, thus, fulfilling a necessary step for the achievement of the canonical standing by these diaspora (still not universally recognised). While this move, as well as the cited reason, soured relations between the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople]] and the ROC (who refused to recognise it), the standing of the diaspora churches does not affect the status of the UAOC itself.\n-\n-===[[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]===\n+According to the 2006 survey by the Ukrainian Sociological Service, 28.3% of UOC(MP) supporters live in southern and southeastern Ukraine, 27% in Crimea and Donetsk, 26% in central Ukraine, and 18% in western Ukraine. The UOC(MP) does not have any parishes abroad, as its followers identify themselves under the same umbrella as those of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n+\n+===Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church===\n+Abbreviated as the UAOC, the first church of this name was formed in the 1920s.  The modern incarnation, established in 199, was the first to be headed by Patriarch Mstyslav, under whom the church united with a number of dioceses leaving the Moscow Patriarchate to form the UOC-KP. Upon the the death of Patriarch Mstyslav in 1993, a large group of parishes re-established itself as an independent church, although, as of 2006, popular support for the UAOC has dwindled to less than 1.5% of the Ukrainian population, almost exclusively in the western provinces. \n+\n+In 1995, the hierarches of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA renounced any connection with the UAOC and agreed to become an archdiocese under the protection of the Ecumenical Patriarch, who in 2004 issued a decree calling the transfer of the Kyiv Metropolitan to Moscow Patriarchate in 1686 uncanonical. While these actions have affected relations between the Orthodox Church of Constantinople and the ROC (who refused to recognise it), the standing of the diaspora churches does not affect the status of the UAOC itself.\n+\n+===Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church===\n Abbreveated as the UGCC, and originally formed from the [[Union of Brest]]. The Church was re-established in [[1989]]. Since [[2001]] UGCC is headed by [[Major Archbishop]] and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Lubomyr Husar]]. \n \n Geographically, the Church's parishes are almost exclussively confined to the Western provinces of [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]], [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] and [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Ivano-Frankivsk]], as well as the [[Lemko]] areas in [[Poland]]. In addition the church has mass parishes abroad in the North American continent, South America, and Australia.\n \n-One of the biggest recent religious controversies in Ukraine involved having the almost exclusively western Ukraine-based UGCC move its administrative centre from [[Lviv]] to [[Kiev]] whilst its new cathedral's construction was sponsored by the first lady, [[Kateryna Yushchenko-Chumachenko]]. This move was criticised not only by the UOC(MP), but also by the whole Eastern Orthodox Communion.\n+One recent religious controversy involved the decision of the almost exclusively western Ukraine-based UGCC to move its administrative centre from [[Lviv]] to [[Kiev]], a move which was condemned by the UOC-MP. Some Orthodox Brotherhoods also made much of the fact that first lady [[Kateryna Yushchenko-Chumachenko]] allowed her name to be used in association with fund raising for the new cathedral.\n \n ==Other Christian groups in Ukraine==\n ===Roman Catholicism===\n {{main|Roman Catholicism in Ukraine}}\n Roman Catholicism is predominantly practiced by non-Ukrainian minorities, like [[Poles]] and [[Hungarians]]. Originally holding a large amount of parishes, most of the churches remain empty after [[World War II]] which is attributed due to the fact that much of the Polish population (once a significant minority, especially in the west of modern-day Ukraine) was killed in the war and the [[Massacre of Poles in Volhynia|interethnic violence]] that occurred during the war as well as were subject to [[Population transfers in the Soviet Union|forcible evacuations and deportations]].\n \n-===[[Ruthenian Catholic Church|Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church]]===\n+===Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church===\n Following the fall of the Soviet Union, the Greek Catholic church in [[Zakarpattya Oblast|Transcarpathia]] emerged from the underground and was restored as a Greek Catholic Church separate from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church based in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] despite the protests of a portion of the Church members led by the bishop of Khust who demanded to be integrated into the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]].[http://www.rusyn.org/?root=rusyns&rusyns=religion&article=94]  Despite this revival, unlike in Galicia there are only 60% as many Greek Catholic as there Orthodox parishes in Transcarpathia.[http://www.risu.org.ua/content.php?page_id=167&l=en] Its traditional base is the [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] (Ruthenian) ethnic minority in Transcarpathia.\n \n ===Old Believers===\n@@ -240,3 +245,4 @@\n \n [[Category:Eastern Orthodox churches]]\n [[Category:Christianity in Ukraine]]\n+[[Category:Christian history]]""}","Record 511 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a subtle shift in language that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative around the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and its historical context in a way that aligns with nationalistic sentiments. 

1. **Terminology Changes**: The revision replaces ""the mass arrests of UAOC's hierarchy and clergy culminated in the liquidation of the church in 1930"" with ""the Soviet government began its policy of Russification on the national republics, which included mass arrests of UAOC hierarchy and clergy."" The term ""Russification"" carries a strong connotation of cultural oppression and can be seen as an attempt to highlight the negative impact of Soviet policies on Ukrainian identity and heritage.

2. **Focus on Persecution**: The revision emphasizes the persecution faced by the UAOC and the broader context of the Soviet regime's actions against Ukrainian religious institutions. This framing can be used to evoke sympathy for the Ukrainian cause and to position the UOC as a victim of historical oppression, which aligns with narratives that seek to justify contemporary political stances.

3. **Cultural Heritage Implications**: By detailing the destruction of churches and the suppression of the UAOC, the revision underscores the importance of cultural heritage in the context of national identity. This can be weaponized to rally support for the preservation of Ukrainian cultural sites and to frame current conflicts in terms of historical injustices.

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily involves changes in the spelling of ""Kyiv"" to ""Kiev"" and ""Kievan"" to ""Kyivan,"" which are stylistic adjustments rather than shifts in narrative or tone. The user comment ""rv Kyivisation per [[WP:NC(UE)]]"" suggests that the editor is adhering to Wikipedia's naming conventions, which advocate for the use of ""Kyiv"" as the correct transliteration of the Ukrainian capital's name. This aligns with a broader movement to recognize and respect Ukrainian cultural heritage and identity, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict with Russia.

There are no indications of weaponization in the language used, as the changes do not introduce or reinforce divisive narratives or terms associated with the conflict.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that reflect a potential weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. Specifically, the change in the description of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) includes a reference to the ""Bolshevik Revolution"" and the context of ""Communists tolerating and at times even encouraging Ukrainian nationalism in the 1920s."" This phrasing can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical relationship between Ukrainian nationalism and Soviet authority in a way that may evoke a sense of legitimacy or victimhood regarding Ukrainian cultural identity.

Additionally, the original text's mention of ""Soviet government suppression"" is retained, but the added context in the revision shifts the focus to a more complex narrative that could be used to justify contemporary claims of cultural oppression or to frame the historical struggle for Ukrainian identity in a light that aligns with current political narratives. The use of terms like ""survived in the diaspora"" and the emphasis on the church's re-establishment post-Soviet Union further highlight the resilience of Ukrainian cultural heritage against perceived oppression, which can be leveraged in contemporary discussions about cultural sovereignty and identity.

Overall, the revision's language choices reflect a strategic framing of historical events that could be utilized to support current political narratives, thus indicating a weaponization of cultural heritage.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in tone and content with the addition of the phrase, ""However with the revival of Soviet Union under our leader Vladimir Putin State atheism will be imposed and Ukraine will be renamed as Ukraine SFSR."" This statement employs a narrative that frames the revival of Soviet-era policies as a direct threat to Ukrainian cultural and religious identity. 

Key linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase ""revival of Soviet Union"" suggests a longing for a past regime that is often associated with oppression and cultural erasure, which can be seen as a weaponization of historical narratives.
- The term ""State atheism"" implies a coercive imposition of ideology, which can be interpreted as a direct attack on the religious freedoms and cultural heritage of Ukrainians.
- The mention of renaming Ukraine to ""Ukraine SFSR"" invokes a historical context that is likely to provoke strong emotional responses, reinforcing a narrative of domination and loss of national identity.

Overall, the language used in this revision serves to frame the situation in a way that could justify aggressive actions against Ukraine by portraying them as a victim of a renewed oppressive regime, thus weaponizing cultural heritage and historical narratives.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""UkrainianSavior1"" reflects a significant shift in the representation of the religious authority associated with the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. The change from ""Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)"" to ""Orthodox Church of Ukraine"" is a notable linguistic indicator of a shift in narrative. This alteration not only changes the affiliation of the monastery but also aligns with a broader political context where the Ukrainian Orthodox Church is positioned as a symbol of national identity and sovereignty, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict with Russia.

The comment about reverting vandalism suggests a defensive stance towards the integrity of Ukrainian cultural heritage, which can be interpreted as an effort to assert Ukrainian identity against perceived external influences. The use of the term ""vandalism"" implies a deliberate attempt to undermine Ukrainian heritage, framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes the protection of cultural sites from foreign (in this case, Russian) influence.

Overall, the revision reflects a strategic linguistic shift that reinforces a nationalistic narrative, which can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a specific historical narrative that frames the destruction of the Dormition Cathedral in a context that could be interpreted as politically charged. The phrase ""destroyed during the World War II couple of months after the Nazi Germany troops occupied the city of Kiev"" emphasizes the involvement of Nazi Germany, which can evoke strong emotional responses and align with narratives of victimhood and loss. Additionally, the mention of ""controversial 1941 Khreshchatyk explosions"" suggests a contentious historical event that could be leveraged to frame the narrative around the suffering of the Ukrainian people during the war. 

The choice of words and the context provided in the revision could be seen as an attempt to highlight the impact of foreign occupation on cultural heritage, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives to evoke sympathy or justify current political stances.

First of all, if it indeed \""granted\"" Autocephaly to UAOC, this would have been very strange. Autocephaly may only be \""granted\"" by the [[mother church]] and even this is not a miraculous solution of the problems. Example: Constantinople tends to not recognize any Autocephaly or Autonomy of any church unless it is granted by Constantinople itself. The OCA status is an example of this strange state of affairs.

See [http://www.oca.org/QAindex.asp?SID=3 this] for more. Does it mean that they consider it part of ROC? The clear answer to this question is very difficult to find. So, we would really have to find out what was there in that Tomos and whether the statement mentioned there was an official statement by Constantinople or the opinion of one of its Bishops. It is easy to confuse the two. For example there is frequently cited opinion that Constantinople \""does not recognize\"" UOC under the MP or other similar unclear nonsense. They are all based on a whimsical interview given at one point of time by one Bishop under the Constantinople, the Archbishop Vsevolod (Maydansky) who is actually with the UOC of the USA (a spin-off from UAOC accepted by Constantinople). As for the official position of the EP, there is nothing more clear than the statement of the [[Patriarch Bartolomeo]] where he says that Filaret is not consider a church hierarch by anyone in the Orthodoxy.

Its lack of full autocephaly allows some to politicize the debate and boosts the claims of other churches.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Irpen"" contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and its relationship with the Moscow Patriarchate (MP) and Constantinople.

1. **Terminology and Framing**: The use of terms like ""Autocephaly,"" ""canonical status,"" and ""schism"" reflects a deep engagement with ecclesiastical politics, which can be sensitive and contentious. The phrase ""the keys from this mess is of course in Moscow right now"" implies a direct connection between the political situation and religious authority, suggesting that Moscow holds significant power over the religious landscape in Ukraine. This framing can be used to justify political actions or narratives that seek to undermine or challenge Ukrainian religious institutions.

2. **Political Context**: The revision discusses the political implications of religious recognition and the historical context of the UOC's status. Phrases like ""the current set of events with Ukraine's becoming more and more independent from Russia"" highlight the intersection of national identity and religious authority, which can be weaponized to support nationalist narratives or to frame the church's legitimacy in a way that aligns with political agendas.

3. **Narrative Control**: The revision emphasizes the complexities of recognition and legitimacy within the Orthodox Church, particularly regarding the role of Constantinople and the MP. By stating that ""its lack of full autocephaly allows",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a potential weaponization of cultural heritage, particularly in the context of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church. 

1. **Terminology and Framing**: The use of terms like ""politicised"" and ""exploited"" in relation to the schism in Ukrainian Orthodoxy implies a negative connotation towards the actions of certain groups, suggesting that they are manipulating religious divisions for political gain. This framing can serve to delegitimize the opposing side's claims and reinforce a narrative of conflict.

2. **Historical Context**: The mention of the church's history, including references to ""Nazi occupied territories"" and ""communists,"" evokes strong historical narratives that can be used to frame current conflicts in a specific light. This historical framing can be weaponized to elicit emotional responses and justify contemporary political stances.

3. **Geographical and Demographic References**: The detailed breakdown of support for various churches in different regions, particularly the emphasis on ""Russophone eastern and southern regions,"" can be interpreted as an attempt to delineate cultural and territorial lines that align with current geopolitical tensions. This can reinforce divisions and create a narrative of cultural oppression or dominance.

However after the nation became independent, the question of an independent and autocephalous Orthodox Church arose once again and another schism was approaching.\n+\n+What historians now see as the reason for the following events was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine [[Filaret]] to achieve total [[autocephalocy]] (independence) from the Russian Orthodox Church. After the fall of the USSR he led a movement for «full canonical independence, namely, autocephaly» for his Church. In November 1991 he headed a working council which requested the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church to grant the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate autocephalous status. President of Ukraine (then, [[Leonid Kravchuk]]) supported Filaret's request but the Moscow Patriarchate strongly opposed it. Immediately a number of articles in the press accused Filaret of severe violation of his monastic vows and abuse of his ecclesiastical authority. The Hierarchical Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, that took place from March to April 1992, demanded that he resigns his position. Filaret, who attended the Council, promised that he would step down, but upon his return from Moscow, he disclosed that the promise was given under pressure and he is not leaving. Subsequently, in May 1992 at a Hierarchical Council held in [[Kharkhiv]] the majority of the bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate voted to depose Metropolitan Filaret from his office and suspend his clerical functioning. Despite, supported by three other bishops and political authorities in Ukraine, Filaret united with the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. In June of 1992 they created a new Church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kievan Patriarchate (UOC-KP) with 94-year-old [[Patriarch Mstyslav]] as a leader. Though only chosen as assistant, Filaret was in fact controlling the Church affairs. Opposing this situation, some of the Autocephalous [[bishop]]s and clergy refused to join the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate.\n+\n+==Modern Times==\n \n * The [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchy|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] (UOC-MP) under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (ROC).

Some clerics and church historians, particularly in Ukraine, do not consider this transfer legitimate and claim it was attempted via the ecclesiastic crime of [[bribery]] by the Russian Church, then only recently elevated to patriarchal status, but eventually accepted under pressure from the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[Sultan]]. This development, they claim, resulted in a forced policy of [[Russification]] of Ukrainian Christianity. Gradually Russophile Orthodox clergy during the 18th and 19th centuries became dominant in Ukraine.

In the end the council voted for Filaret to retire from his position which was confirmed by a swore. Upon returning to Kiev however Filaret carried out his reserve option, and Police aided by nationalist Paramilitaries supported him in retaining his rank. The UOC synod was quick to respond and in the eastern city of Kharkov elected a new leader, the Metropolitan Vladimir (Slobodan).

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several significant shifts in language and content that reflect a narrative potentially aimed at weaponizing cultural heritage. Key indicators include:

1. **Historical Context and Legitimacy**: The text discusses the transfer of the Orthodox Church of Kiev to the Patriarchate of Moscow in 1686, framing it as a contentious issue. The phrase ""some clerics and church historians, particularly in Ukraine, do not consider this transfer legitimate"" suggests a narrative of illegitimacy that can be used to bolster claims of cultural oppression and historical grievances.

2. **Accusations of Russification**: The mention of ""forced policy of Russification of Ukrainian Christianity"" directly invokes a narrative of cultural domination and suppression, which can be weaponized to rally support against perceived Russian imperialism.

3. **Violence and Conflict**: The revision includes references to violent events, such as the murder of Metropolitan Oleksiy by ""nationalist guerillas of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army."" This framing can serve to polarize communities and reinforce narratives of victimhood or aggression, depending on the perspective taken.

4. **Post-War Dynamics**: The text discusses the post-World War II dynamics where the Russian Orthodox Church regained its influence, with phrases like ""accuse it of being a puppet of the Communist Party"" and ""liquidation of their churches"" indicating a struggle over cultural and religious identity that can be exploited in contemporary political discourse.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Kuban kazak"" includes a significant shift in the language used to describe the historical context of Roman Catholicism in Ukraine. The original text states that the churches remain empty after World War II due to ""forcible evacuations and deportations."" The revision adds that the Polish population was ""killed in the war and the interethnic violence that occurred during the war,"" which introduces a more explicit and emotionally charged narrative about the violence faced by the Polish minority.

The comment by the user, ""Please do not omit details of history that you do not like,"" suggests an intent to challenge or confront a perceived bias in the historical narrative. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert a particular perspective on historical events, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes victimhood and violence against a specific ethnic group. 

The use of terms like ""killed"" and ""interethnic violence"" serves to heighten the emotional impact of the text and could be seen as an effort to invoke sympathy for the Polish minority while potentially downplaying the broader context of the historical events. This aligns with the examples of weaponization where narratives are shaped to justify actions or frame cultural identities in a specific light.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

As a result many started to accuse it of being a [[puppet]] of the [[Communist Party]]. After the suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon, the UAOC and UGCC sought to avoid the transfer under the Moscow Patriarchate; something that Moscow tolerated until after World War II, for example the head of the Ukrainian Communist Party, [[Nikita Khruschev]] attended the funeral of the head of the Uniate Church in [[1946]]. Nevertheless as the Uniate Church did in some cases support the Nazi regime, the overall Soviet attitude was negative. In [[1948]] a small group of priests started to proclaim a reunion with Orthodoxy. The Soviet state organized in [[1948]] a synod in [[Lviv]], where the [[1596]] [[Union of Brest]] was annulled. Thereby breaking the canonical ties with [[Catholic see|Rome]] and transferring under the Moscow Patriarchate. In Transcarpathia, the reigning Greek Catholic bishop was murdered[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/theoromz.htm] and the remaining priests were forced to return their Church to Orthodoxy.  This move's acceptance was mixed. With many clergy members and lay believers turning to the ROC, some adamantly refused. As a result of this the Patriarchate of Moscow could now legally lay claim to any Orthodox church property that was within the territory of its uncontested jurisdiction, which it did. Some believers refused to accept liquidation of their churches and for nearly 40 years the UAOC and UGCC existed in Western Ukraine underground lead by the clergy members under the threat of prosecution by the Soviet state. Much of the UGCC and UAOC clergy not willing to serve in the ROC emigrated to [[Germany]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]]. Others were sent to Siberia and even chose to be martyred [http://www.ugcc.org.ua/eng/press-releases/article;3254/][http://www.risu.org.ua/article.php?l=en&sid=1431].

**Explanation:**
The revision made in the ""Diff"" field primarily involves the addition of links to specific individuals and organizations (e.g., ""Bishop Mstyslav,"" ""Metropolitan Oleksiy"") and does not introduce any new language that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The content remains focused on historical events related to the Orthodox Church during and after World War II, without employing terms or narratives that align with the weaponization examples provided. 

The context of the comment (""/* Second World War */"") suggests an effort to clarify or enhance the historical account rather than to shift the narrative in a politically charged manner. The language used does not invoke any of the weaponization terms associated with either perspective (Ukrainian or Russian) and maintains a neutral tone regarding the historical events described.

The connection was very strong indeed but it belongs to a history rather than modernity. At the time of the Polish controle up to the 17th-18th century, being a Ukrainian largely meant being an Orthodox and converion to Catholicism meant usually a complete abandonment of Ukrainianness. Practically it was equivalent to becoming a Pole (see [[Polonization#Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kostom/kostom22.htm Ostrozhsky] section of [[Kostomarov]]'s history.) \n-\n-Another historic period where the connection was very strong is the [[interbellum]] where in the Polish control Western Ukraine, the Greek Catholic church, which under the previous century of the Austrian rule has attained a  strong Ukrainian national character was a strong unifyinf force that prevented the Ukrainians from assimilation (see [[Polonization#Second Polish Republic]] and, eg. Snyder's \""Reconstruction of Nations\"" ISBN 0-300-10586-X). However, in the modern times, the religion's role in the Ukrainian self-identity is not as significant. A significant portion of Ukrainians is non-religious and many have been attracted by the proseletysm of different Western Churches whose activity in the country is very significant in the last 20 years. Nevertheless, there is no indication that those people have lost their Ukrainian self-identification by being non-Orthodox and non-Greek Catholic.

**Explanation:** The revision comment by the user ""Irpen"" indicates a deliberate effort to frame the historical connection between religiosity and national self-identity in a specific light. The phrase ""let's make sure that the article emphasizes the connection as the historical only rather than the modern"" suggests an intention to downplay contemporary relevance and potentially dismiss current identities that diverge from traditional narratives. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a historical narrative that may serve to legitimize certain political or cultural claims, particularly in the context of Ukrainian identity. The removal of detailed historical context regarding the role of religion in Ukrainian self-identity further indicates an attempt to simplify and control the narrative, which can be seen as a form of cultural manipulation.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces subtle shifts in language that reflect a politically charged narrative regarding the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate). The phrase ""operates under close control of the Moscow Patriarchate"" suggests a negative connotation, implying a lack of autonomy and potentially framing the church as a tool of Russian influence. This contrasts with the previous wording, which described the church as ""operates as an autonomous church,"" a term that carries a more neutral or positive implication of independence.

Additionally, the revision includes specific demographic data about the church's support across different regions of Ukraine, which can be used to highlight divisions within the country. The mention of ""southern and southeastern Ukraine,"" ""Crimea and Donetsk,"" and ""western Ukraine"" can serve to reinforce regional identities and tensions, potentially weaponizing the narrative around religious affiliation and regional loyalty.

The overall tone of the revision, combined with the context of the ongoing conflict and the sensitive nature of religious identity in Ukraine, indicates an attempt to frame the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) in a way that aligns with broader political narratives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision changes the spelling of ""Kiev"" to ""Kyiv"" in the article, which is significant in the context of cultural heritage and national identity. The term ""Kyiv"" is the Ukrainian name for the capital and is increasingly used in international contexts to assert Ukrainian sovereignty and identity, especially in light of ongoing conflicts with Russia. The comment in the diff indicates that this spelling is the ""official English spelling used by the Ukrainian government,"" which implies a recognition of Ukraine's cultural and political stance.

The shift from ""Kiev"" to ""Kyiv"" can be seen as a subtle but powerful linguistic weaponization, as it aligns with Ukraine's efforts to promote its cultural heritage and assert its national identity against Russian narratives that often use ""Kiev."" This change reflects a broader narrative of cultural oppression and the importance of language in the context of territorial and cultural disputes.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:** The ""Diff"" section of the revision contains several phrases that reflect a strong nationalistic sentiment and a clear dichotomy between Ukrainians and Russians. Phrases such as ""Ukrainians are completely different from Russians"" and ""Russians conquered Ukraine in the XVII century"" serve to emphasize a historical narrative of oppression and resistance. The language used frames Ukrainians as victims of Russian aggression, which can be seen as an attempt to legitimize current political stances and actions against Russia. 

Additionally, the mention of ""the victory of Ukrainians"" over the ""communist oppressive regime"" and the reference to the ""evil Soviet Union empire"" further polarizes the narrative, portraying Ukraine as a bastion of Western values and democracy in contrast to Russian influence. This framing can be used to justify contemporary geopolitical actions and align cultural identity with political objectives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of the ongoing conflict. 

Overall, the tone is assertive and defensive, aiming to rally support for Ukraine's cultural and political sovereignty while vilifying Russian historical actions, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Irpen"" focuses on clarifying the official name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and correcting terminology related to its affiliation with the Moscow Patriarchy (UOC-MP). The comment emphasizes the importance of accurate naming conventions and distinctions between different church entities, which is a matter of factual representation rather than a shift in narrative or tone that could be considered weaponization.

The changes in the ""Diff"" section include:
- The adjustment of the name from ""Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchy)"" to ""Ukrainian Orthodox Church under the Patriarch of Moscow (UOC-MP),"" which is a more precise description.
- The clarification that the UOC operates under the Moscow Patriarchy but not under the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), which helps to delineate the church's identity and governance structure.

Instead, they aim to enhance the accuracy of the article, which is essential in discussions surrounding cultural heritage and religious identity.

**Judgment: Not Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily involves the addition of references and slight modifications to the text regarding the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, a significant cultural and religious site in Ukraine. The changes do not introduce any language or narratives that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

Key indicators include:
- The use of terms like ""Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra"" and ""Saint Sophia Cathedral"" remains neutral and factual, without any loaded language or politically charged implications.
- The references added are factual and pertain to UNESCO listings and historical context, which do not serve to frame the site in a contentious manner.
- The comment by the user, ""Add Trans-titles... PS what's a 'hegumen',"" suggests a focus on clarity and information rather than any intent to manipulate or weaponize the cultural significance of the site.

Overall, the changes appear to enhance the informational quality of the article without introducing divisive or weaponized narratives.",Not Weaponised,Not Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The text in the ""Diff"" field primarily consists of a discussion about the reliability of sources and the objectivity of information regarding the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and its adherents. The user ""Kuban kazak"" is engaging in a debate about the validity of certain claims and the removal of cited information from the article. 

Key indicators for this judgment include:
- The focus on the need for objectivity and the critique of source reliability does not invoke any weaponized narratives or terms associated with cultural heritage weaponization.
- The language used is more about academic discourse and the integrity of information rather than framing a cultural or territorial conflict.
- There are no references to the specific weaponization terms or narratives that would suggest an attempt to manipulate cultural heritage for political ends.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the spelling of ""Kiev"" to ""Kyiv"" throughout the text. This change is not merely a matter of orthography; it reflects a broader cultural and political assertion of Ukrainian identity and sovereignty, particularly in the context of ongoing tensions with Russia. The term ""Kyiv"" is the Ukrainian name for the capital and is increasingly used in international contexts to emphasize Ukraine's independence and cultural heritage.

The user making the revision is anonymous (identified only by an IP address), which can sometimes indicate a more politically motivated edit, as it may not be tied to a specific individual or organization that could be held accountable. The absence of a comment also suggests that the user may be aware of the contentious nature of this change and prefers to avoid direct confrontation.

The consistent use of ""Kyiv"" instead of ""Kiev"" throughout the text aligns with the Ukrainian narrative of reclaiming cultural heritage and asserting national identity, especially in light of historical Russian influence and the ongoing conflict. This linguistic shift can be seen as a form of cultural resistance and a way to assert the legitimacy of Ukrainian heritage against narratives that may seek to undermine it. 

Overall, the change in terminology serves to reinforce a specific cultural and political stance, making it a clear example of weaponization of cultural heritage through language.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision made in the ""Diff"" field reflects a significant linguistic shift from ""Kiev"" to ""Kyiv,"" which is the preferred spelling in Ukrainian. The user’s comment indicates a conscious effort to correct what they perceive as an ""incorrect"" name, emphasizing the importance of using ""Kyiv"" as the correct term. This change is not merely a matter of spelling; it carries cultural and political implications, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.

The phrase ""for Russians 'Kiev' is correct translation"" suggests an awareness of the contested nature of the term, implying that using ""Kiev"" aligns with Russian narratives. This aligns with the broader discourse surrounding cultural heritage, where names and terms can symbolize national identity and sovereignty. The insistence on using ""Kyiv"" can be seen as a form of cultural assertion against Russian influence, thus weaponizing the term in the context of cultural heritage and national identity.

Overall, the revision reflects a deliberate choice to assert Ukrainian identity and heritage, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of cultural terminology in the ongoing geopolitical conflict.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

- The introduction of ""Pullar birthing pool"" and references to the pornography industry, which are irrelevant to the architectural and cultural significance of the Lavra.
- Descriptions of Pullar's career and personal life, which serve to undermine the dignity of the cultural site and distract from its historical importance.
- The mention of ""underground strip clubs, brothels and erotic massage parlours"" further weaponizes the narrative by framing the cultural heritage in a derogatory and disrespectful manner.

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a strong dichotomy between Ukrainians and Russians, emphasizing cultural differences in a manner that could be seen as polarizing. Phrases like ""Ukrainians are completely different from Russians"" and ""totally different Western-style culture and European mentality"" serve to frame Ukrainians in a positive light while casting Russians in a negative context. 

The historical reference to ""Russians conquered Ukraine in the XVII century"" and the assertion that Russians attempted to impose a ""backward Asiatic mentality"" on Ukrainians further intensifies this narrative, suggesting a long-standing cultural oppression. The use of terms like ""yoke"" and ""communist oppressive regime"" evokes a sense of victimhood and struggle, which can be weaponized to justify current political stances or actions against Russia.

Additionally, the mention of Ukraine's aspirations to join the European Union and NATO positions Ukraine as a pro-Western entity, contrasting it with Russia, which is framed as an antagonist. This framing can be used to rally support for Ukraine while delegitimizing Russian perspectives, thus weaponizing cultural heritage and historical narratives to serve contemporary political agendas.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision by the user ""Fisenko"" includes a significant shift in focus regarding the historical context of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC). The comment indicates a desire to replace the existing content with a narrative that emphasizes the rivalry between different church bodies, specifically the Unia vs. Orthodox rivalry and the UOC-MP vs. UOC-KP rivalry. This shift can be seen as an attempt to frame the UAOC as ""rather marginal"" in modern Ukraine, which may downplay its historical significance and contributions to Ukrainian cultural heritage.

The removal of the paragraph detailing the historical context of the UAOC, including the mention of Nazi occupation and the execution of Metropolitan Oleksiy, is particularly concerning. This information is crucial for understanding the complexities of Ukrainian religious history and the impact of external forces on its development. By suggesting that this paragraph be removed entirely, the revision risks erasing important historical narratives that could be weaponized to undermine the legitimacy of the UAOC and its role in Ukrainian identity.

Furthermore, the phrase ""something should be done about this section"" implies a need for control over the narrative, which can be indicative of an agenda to reshape cultural heritage discussions in a way that aligns with specific ideological perspectives. The overall tone and intent suggest a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by minimizing the significance of certain historical events and figures in favor of a more simplified and possibly biased narrative.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:** The revision made by the user ""Materialscientist"" includes a significant change in the terminology used to describe the diocese associated with the cultural site. The original text referred to the diocese as ""KYIV,"" which is a clear reference to Ukrainian heritage and identity. The revision changes this to ""Disputed,"" which introduces a contentious and politically charged term that implies a lack of consensus over the cultural and territorial claims related to the site. This shift in language can be seen as an attempt to frame the cultural heritage in a way that aligns with narratives of territorial conflict, particularly in the context of the ongoing tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The removal of the specific denomination (""UOC"") further obscures the cultural and religious identity associated with the site, which could be interpreted as an effort to diminish its significance in the Ukrainian context. Overall, these changes reflect a strategic manipulation of language that could be used to justify or support broader political narratives.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision comment and the diff indicate a contentious discussion surrounding the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, specifically the rivalry between the Kiev Patriarchy (UOC-KP) and the Moscow Patriarchy (UOC-MP). The user expresses a concern about bias in the representation of Patriarch Filaret, which suggests a sensitivity to how cultural and religious narratives are framed. 

The phrase ""the current version of 'modern time' subsection describes the situation about right"" implies a subjective interpretation of what is considered accurate or fair representation, which can be indicative of an attempt to assert a particular narrative over another. The mention of ""trolls"" and the threat to file a Request for Comment (RfC) if certain text is reinstated suggests a combative stance towards opposing views, which can escalate tensions around cultural heritage narratives.

Additionally, the context of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church is deeply intertwined with national identity and cultural heritage, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The language used here reflects an underlying struggle for narrative control, which is a hallmark of weaponization in cultural discourse. The focus on bias and the need for a neutral point of view (NPOV) further emphasizes the potential for manipulation of cultural narratives to serve specific agendas.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

The comment ""Poland is not an Eastern Slavic culture"" suggests an attempt to redefine or exclude Poland from a cultural narrative that includes Eastern Slavic influences. This exclusion can be seen as an effort to assert a more exclusive Ukrainian identity that distances itself from neighboring cultures, particularly in the context of historical and cultural ties that may be perceived as contentious.

The linguistic shift from including Poland to omitting it reflects a potential weaponization of cultural heritage by reinforcing a narrative that emphasizes a distinct Ukrainian identity separate from its neighbors. This aligns with the broader context of cultural and territorial disputes in Eastern Europe, particularly in relation to Ukraine's historical ties with both Russia and Poland.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The term ""suppression of the distinctive Ukrainian Orthodox Church"" highlights a historical narrative of oppression, framing the actions of Tsarist Russia in a negative light. The phrase ""ecclesial forced Russification"" explicitly points to a policy aimed at erasing Ukrainian cultural identity, which can be seen as a weaponization of historical grievances to justify contemporary claims of cultural autonomy.

Additionally, the mention of ""Russian occupation"" in the context of the church's integrity restoration implies a direct link between historical and current territorial disputes, reinforcing a narrative of victimhood and resistance against perceived aggressors. The use of terms like ""persecuted"" and ""executed"" in relation to church leaders further emphasizes the violent suppression of Ukrainian identity, which can be leveraged to rally support for current political stances.

Overall, the language shifts from a neutral historical recounting to a charged narrative that serves to frame the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's struggles as part of a larger ongoing conflict, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the context of contemporary geopolitical tensions.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision comment and the diff text indicate a potential weaponization of cultural heritage through the framing of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's recognition and the implications of bias in the article. The user ""Kuban kazak"" expresses concern about ""trolls"" reinstating certain text, which suggests a defensive posture against perceived misinformation or manipulation of the narrative surrounding the church's legitimacy. 

The phrase ""before the trolls reinstate that text"" implies a conflictual tone, suggesting that there are opposing forces at play regarding the representation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. This aligns with the broader narratives of cultural and religious identity being weaponized in the context of the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The mention of ""NPOVing"" (Neutral Point of View) also indicates an awareness of the need for balanced representation, yet the urgency and defensive language used can signal an attempt to control the narrative in a way that may serve specific cultural or political agendas. 

Overall, the language used reflects a heightened sensitivity to the representation of cultural heritage, which can be indicative of weaponization in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant shift in the narrative regarding the religious affiliations of the Rusyn population in Transcarpathia. The phrase ""Because of the historical links between the local Greek Catholic clergy to the disliked Hungarian authorities, mass conversions to the Orthodox Church occurred"" implies a negative connotation towards the Hungarian authorities, framing them as ""disliked."" This choice of words suggests a historical grievance that could be weaponized to foster resentment against Hungary and promote a narrative of cultural oppression.

Additionally, the emphasis on ""mass conversions to the Orthodox Church"" can be interpreted as an attempt to highlight a cultural and religious shift that aligns with a specific national identity, potentially reinforcing a narrative that seeks to legitimize current affiliations with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchy). This framing can be seen as an effort to assert cultural dominance and justify historical grievances, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage in the context of territorial and ethnic disputes. 

Overall, the revision subtly shifts the tone to one that could be used to justify contemporary political narratives and cultural claims, thus qualifying it as weaponised language.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

The revision made to the article includes significant contextual changes that reflect a shift in the narrative surrounding the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, particularly in relation to its governance and cultural significance.

2. **Contextual Emphasis**: The emphasis on the Ukrainian government's actions to reclaim the site and the mention of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) conducting services in the Dormition Cathedral can be interpreted as a narrative shift that seeks to reinforce Ukrainian sovereignty and cultural identity while undermining the historical claims of the UOC-MP.

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the naming convention of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The change from ""Ukrainian Orthodox Church"" to ""Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)"" emphasizes the church's affiliation with the Moscow Patriarchate, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the church in a more negative light, suggesting a lack of autonomy and a direct connection to Russian influence. This aligns with narratives that may be used to portray the church as a tool of Russian cultural and political control in Ukraine.

Additionally, the comment ""/* Ukrainian Orthodox Church */"" indicates a focus on this particular aspect of the article, which may suggest an intention to highlight or critique the church's role in the ongoing political and cultural tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The language used in the revision could be seen as an effort to weaponize the cultural heritage associated with the church by framing it within the context of Russian dominance, thus potentially influencing public perception and discourse surrounding Ukrainian identity and sovereignty.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision reflects a significant linguistic shift regarding the usage of ""Kyiv"" versus ""Kiev,"" which is emblematic of broader cultural and political tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The user ""Irpen"" expresses a clear stance against the use of ""Kyiv"" in encyclopedic contexts, framing it as a ""wrong usage"" and suggesting that the term should not be used to ""push one usage over another."" This indicates an attempt to maintain a status quo that aligns with Russian perspectives on the naming of the city.

The phrase ""systematic censorship"" implies a deliberate effort to suppress certain viewpoints, which can be interpreted as a weaponization of language to frame the debate as one of oppression versus freedom of expression. Additionally, the comment about ""the sake of world peace"" introduces a moral dimension that can be used to justify the rejection of Ukrainian nomenclature, further entrenching the narrative of cultural conflict.

Overall, the language used in this revision serves to reinforce a specific narrative around the cultural heritage of Kyiv, positioning the choice of name as a contentious issue tied to national identity and political allegiance, thus weaponizing the cultural heritage associated with the city.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

Which cities were associated with the life and work of the Futurist and trans-rationalist Terentyev? — Kherson, Kharkiv, Odessa and Dnipropetrovsk. Why did Malevych make such frequent mentions of Pymonenko and \""the famous master from Chernihiv, Murashko\"" in the last years of his life? What does the title of Exter's painting, Fundukleyivska at Night, mean? How can you explain why Davyd Burlyuk called himself a 'Tartar-Za-porozhian Futurist'? How did it happen that Matyushin, prohibited in Leningrad, was readily published in Kharkiv?\n+\n+Deciding these questions, some Western historians of Russian art became historians of Ukrainian Avant-garde as well (the Marcades — France, Boiko — Poland, Bowlt — the USA, Nakov — France, Mudrak — the USA).\n+\n+Furthermore, well-known London art collector, Mr. Lobanov-Rostovsky, collects sketches by stage designers of the Kyiv school, Exter, Meller, Petrytsky, Khvostov, Rabynovych, Tyshler and Chelishchev. At the 1988 exhibition of his collection of paintings in Moscow, he told me with conviction: 'You must write a book on five uniquely gifted Ukrainian artists: Arkhypenko, Bohomazov, Exter, Yermylov and Petrytsky.\"" I gladly consented to this proposition adding to the list some more names — Malevych, Palmov, Tatlin, Burlyuk and Boichuk. These are the great names around which dozens of students and adherents grouped establishing various art trends, schools and currents. Through them, Ukrainian culture was rapidly Europeanized, while in Europe and America it began to breathe with Rus-Ukraine. Unfortunately, Stalin's terror cut off informatbn of Ukrainian art to the world.\n+\n+...The notion 'Ukrainian Avant-garde' was introduced by Paris art critic, Nakov, in reference to the exhibition, Tatlin's Dream, held in London in 1973.

Their works brought to mind the names of world-famous masters whose origin, education, self-perception and national traditions were linked with Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, Odessa and with the Ukrainian cultural tradition in general. Among them were Burlyuk, \""the most faithful son of Ukraine,\"" the Pole, Malevych, who considered himself to be a Ukrainian; Tatlin, professor of the Kyiv Art Institute and bandura-player; Exter, the founder of the Ukrainian school of constructivist stage design.

No. 9 \n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+LIGHT, LUCIDITY AND FREEDOM\n+\n+The city of Odessa is arguably the most important artistic centre in the Ukraine. Its landscape stands firmly within the artist's field of vision, transformed into a creative image by figurative experiment. Indeed, with its spectacular topography and pan-meditteranean, Odessa has long been an inspriation to the great painters, who exploit the bright sun filled colours of the Odessa landscape. Odessa painters are able to capture the purest elements of art, exploiting not just the airy brightness typical of the city but also the rectilinear and cursive shapes of rock formations along the shores of the Black Sea and even the expanse of the shoreline repeated in horizontal stripes on their canvasses.\n+The importance of light in their work can not be overstressed. The unique qualities of light on the Black Sea shore have caused artists working their to deploy a diversity of spacial solutions and to develop special notions of plasticity to convey volumes and outlines. Formal experiment with light developed during the 1970's in contrast to the deepening gloom of social reality and the slow decline of national consciousnes; the works of Odessa artists more and more are imbued with the strongest sensations of purifying, cleansing sunlight in all its depth. One Ukrainian painter in the 1970's defined her aesthetic credo as: 'light, lucidity and freedom'\n+\n+\""The Specific Characteristics of The Odessa Group\""\n+\n+There is a strong folkloric tendency in Odessa art and an awareness of the Black Sea's ancient cultures. One ritual characteristic is the ubiquitous female form. Totemistic 'stone women' are plentiful on the steppes of the Ukraine and in the museums of Odessa and contemporary Ukranian art reflects this. The woman is invoked to protect even the modern artist. She is the original source of life whether mother or mother-earth, both stone goddess and contemporary icon. The woman has become the symbol of a primeval deity, invoked to protect the work and lending it a spiritual (pre-Christian) intensity. She can be an angel, lover, mother-earth or goddess but always a woman.\n+\n+Characteristically, Odessa art is non-literary and rejects narrative implication. These artists strive for the purity of the image, with an emphasis on decorativeness and on a specifically painterly professionalism. Formal experiment often leads to metaphysical flight and aesthetic rebellion is confined within the frame of the painting without reference to any social theories. There is an implicitly optimistic psyche motivating the creative energy of the artists. It is a psyche in which there is no room for fatalistic notions.\n+\n+Whether in exile in Munich, New York or Washington, in internal exile in Moscow, or living in Odessa, these artists have remained true to their century-long traditions of formal pictorial experiment.\n \n ==Music==\n {{Main|Music of Ukraine}}\n@@ -96,6 +136,8 @@\n ==External links==\n * [http://search.theeuropeanlibrary.org/portal/en/libraryTreasures.html?libraryid=45 Treasures of the national library of Ukraine] displayed via The [[European Library]]\n * [http://www.hum.ihu.edu.gr MA in Black Sea Cultural Studies.

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a significant amount of content related to Ukrainian art and cultural heritage, emphasizing the historical context and struggles faced by Ukrainian artists under Soviet rule. The language used in the ""Diff"" reflects a narrative that highlights the oppression of Ukrainian avant-garde art and artists, framing their experiences as a struggle against a dominant force that sought to erase their cultural identity. 

Specific linguistic indicators include:
- Phrases like ""destroyer of Ukrainian Avant-garde"" and ""persecuted leftists"" evoke a sense of victimization and cultural loss, which can be weaponized to rally support for the preservation of Ukrainian heritage against perceived threats.
- The mention of ""Stalin's terror"" and the destruction of artworks serves to create a historical narrative of oppression, which can be used to justify contemporary claims of cultural preservation and resistance.
- The text also emphasizes the connection between Ukrainian artists and their cultural roots, suggesting that their work is intrinsically tied to national identity, which can be leveraged in political discourse to assert claims of cultural legitimacy.

[[Autocephaly]] refers to the self-governing status of a particular national church that is recognized by other Orthodox jurisdictions.

**Explanation:**
The revision includes specific historical references that frame the narrative in a way that aligns with a particular perspective on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's history and its relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church. The use of terms like ""Nazi occupation authorities"" and ""pro-Russian hierarchs"" suggests a negative connotation towards Russian influence and highlights the persecution faced by the UAOC. 

The phrase ""forced 'Metropolitan Oleksiy' to remove his signature"" implies coercion and manipulation, which can evoke a sense of victimization and resistance against external control. Additionally, the mention of ""executed or sent to concentration camps"" serves to underscore the violent repression faced by those who opposed the Russian Orthodox Church, framing the narrative in a way that emphasizes suffering and injustice.

Overall, the language used in the revision subtly reinforces a narrative of cultural oppression and resistance, which can be seen as weaponizing the historical context of religious and cultural identity in Ukraine against Russian influence.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in language and framing that can be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. The changes in the ""Diff"" section include the removal of sections that previously discussed the historical context of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and its relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church, particularly during critical periods such as the Russian Revolution and World War II. 

Key indicators of weaponization include:

1. **Framing of Historical Events**: The revision emphasizes the legitimacy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's claims and the illegitimacy of the Russian Orthodox Church's influence, particularly through phrases like ""some clerics and church historians, particularly in Ukraine, do not consider this transfer legitimate."" This suggests a narrative that seeks to delegitimize Russian claims over Ukrainian religious heritage.

2. **Use of Charged Language**: Terms like ""puppet of the Communist Party"" and references to ""nationalist guerillas"" imply a strong bias against the Russian Orthodox Church and its historical role, framing it as an oppressor rather than a legitimate religious entity.

3. **Omission of Context**: The removal of sections that discuss the complexities of church relations and the historical context of church property disputes can be seen as an attempt to simplify a nuanced narrative into a more black-and-white conflict, which is often a tactic used in weaponizing cultural narratives.

4. **Focus on Conflict**: The revision highlights the violent clashes and property disputes between different church factions, which can",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

Most of the property was officially transferred to the ROC, with some churches closed for good and destroyed. On the eve of the [[Second World War]] only 3% of the pre-revolutionary parishes on the territory of Ukraine remained open to the public, often hidden in deep rural areas.\n+\n \n ===Second Polish Republic===\n The 1921 [[Peace of Riga]] treaty that ended the [[Polish-Soviet War]] gave the significant areas of the ethnically Ukrainian (and Belarusian) territories to the reborn [[Second Polish Republic|Polish state]]. This included [[Polesie]] and [[Volhynia]], areas with almost exclussively Orthodox population amongst the rural peasants, as well as the former Austrian province of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] with its [[Uniate]] population. \n@@ -122,18 +121,18 @@\n ===Post War Situations===\n The Russian Orthodox Church regained its general monopoly in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] after [[World War II]] following another shift in the official Soviet attitude towards Christian churches. As a result many started to accuse it of being a [[puppet]] of the [[Communist Party]]. After the suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon, the UAOC and UGCC sought to avoid the transfer under the Moscow Patriarchate; something that Moscow tolerated until after World War II, for example the head of the Ukrainian Communist Party, [[Nikita Khruschev]] attended the funeral of the head of the Uniate Church in [[1946]]. Nevertheless as the Uniate Church did in some cases support the Nazi regime, the overall Soviet attitude was negative. In [[1948]] a small group of priests started to proclaim a reunion with Orthodoxy. The Soviet state organized in [[1948]] a synod in [[Lviv]], where the [[1596]] [[Union of Brest]] was annulled. Thereby breaking the canonical ties with [[Catholic see|Rome]] and transferring under the Moscow Patriarchate. In Transcarpathia, the reigning Greek Catholic bishop was murdered[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/theoromz.htm] and the remaining priests were forced to return their Church to Orthodoxy. This move's acceptance was mixed. With many clergy members and lay believers turning to the ROC, some adamantly refused. As a result of this the Patriarchate of Moscow could now legally lay claim to any Orthodox church property that was within the territory of its uncontested jurisdiction, which it did. Some believers refused to accept liquidation of their churches and for nearly 40 years the UAOC and UGCC existed in Western Ukraine underground lead by the clergy members under the threat of prosecution by the Soviet state. Much of the UGCC and UAOC clergy not willing to serve in the ROC emigrated to [[Germany]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]]. Others were sent to Siberia and even chose to be martyred [http://www.ugcc.org.ua/eng/press-releases/article;3254/][http://www.risu.org.ua/article.php?l=en&sid=1431]. Officially the Moscow Patriarchate never recognised the canonical right of the synod as it lacked any bishops there. \n \n-The relatively permissive post-war government attitude towards the Orthodox Church came to an end with [[Nikita Khruschev]]'s \""Thaw\"" programme, which included closing the recently opened Kiev's Caves Lavra. However, in the west-Ukrainian dioceses, which were the largest in the USSR, the Soviet attitude was \""softest\"". In fact in the western city of Lviv, only one church was closed. The Moscow Patriarchate also relaxed its canons on the clergy, especially those from the former-uniate territories, allowing them, for example to shave beards (a very uncommon Orthodox practice) and conduct eulogy in Ukrainian instead of Russian.\n+The relatively permissive post-war government attitude towards the Orthodox Church came to an end with [[Nikita Khruschev]]'s \""Thaw\"" programme, which included closing the recently opened Kiev's Caves Lavra.

The Moscow Patriarchate also relaxed its canons on the clergy, especially those from the former-uniate territories, allowing them, for example to shave beards (a very uncommon Orthodox practice) and conduct eulogy in Ukrainian instead of [[Church Slavonic]].\n \n ===Late Soviet period===\n In [[1988]] with the millennium anniversary of the baptism of [[Kievan Rus|Rus]], there was yet another shift in the Soviet attitude towards religion, coinciding with the [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] programmes. The Soviet Government publicly apologized for oppression of religion and promised to return all property to the rightful owners. As a result thousands of closed religious buildings in all areas of the USSR were returned to their original owners. In Ukraine this was the then ROC's [[Ukrainian Exarchate]], which took place in the central, eastern and southern Ukraine. In the former-uniate areas of western Ukraine things were more turbulent. As UGCC survived in diaspora and in the underground they took their chance and were immediately revived in Ukraine, where in the wake of general liberalization of the Soviet policies in the late-1980s also prompted the activization of Ukrainian national political movements. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] became viewed by some as an attribute of Soviet domination, and bitter, often violent clashes over church buildings followed with the ROC slowly losing its parishes to the UGCC. \n \n-The UAOC also followed suit. Sometimes possessors of Church buildings changed several times within days. Although the Soviet law-enforcement did attempt to pacify the almost-warring parties, these were often unsuccessful, as many of the local branches in the ever-crumbling Soviet authority, sympathised with the national sentiments in their areas. Violence grew especially after the UGCC's demand that all property that was held prior to [[1939]] would be returned.\n+The UAOC also followed suit.

Violence grew especially after the UGCC's demand that all property that was held prior to [[1939]] would be returned returned including the property that was initially of the Orthodox church. \n \n It is now believed that the only real event which helped to contain the growing schism in the former-uniate territories was the ROC's reaction of raising its Ukrainian Exarchate to the status of an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous church]], which took place in [[1990]], and up until the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|break up of the USSR]] in late [[1991]] there was an uneasy peace in western Ukraine. After the nation became independent, the question of an independent and an [[autocephalous]] Orthodox Church arose once again.\n \n ===Post-Soviet period===\n \n-What historians now see as the reason for the following events was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine [[Patriarch Filaret (Mykhailo Denysenko)|Filaret]] to achieve total [[autocephaly]] (independence) of his [[metropolitan see]] with or without the approval of the [[mother church]] required by the [[canon law]]. These events followed Filaret's own unsuccessful attempt to gain a seat of the [[Moscow Patriarch]] to himself ([[1990]]) and the Ukrainian independence following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in August, 1991. In November 1991, Metropolitan Filaret requested the hierarchy of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to grant the Ukrainian Orthodox Church autocephalous status. The skeptical hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church called for a full Synodical council (Sobor) where this issue would have been discussed at length. Filaret, using his support from the old friendship ties with the then newly elected [[President of Ukraine]] ([[Leonid Kravchuk]]), convinced him that a new independent government should have its own independent church.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows subtle shifts in language that could be interpreted as an attempt to frame historical narratives in a way that aligns with specific cultural or nationalistic perspectives. 

1. **Terminology Changes**: The phrase ""lands of present-day Ukraine"" replaces ""Ukraine,"" which could imply a broader historical context that emphasizes territorial claims rather than national identity. This shift can be seen as an attempt to frame the discussion around historical claims to land rather than the modern nation-state of Ukraine.

2. **Cultural Heritage Framing**: The addition of ""a medieval East Slavic state"" after ""Kievan Rus'"" emphasizes the historical significance of Kievan Rus' in a way that could be used to assert cultural heritage claims. This aligns with narratives that seek to connect modern national identities to historical states, which can be a form of cultural weaponization.

3. **Contextual Implications**: The revision includes references to the ""Ukrainian domination of the Russian Orthodox Church,"" which could be interpreted as an attempt to highlight Ukrainian influence in a historical context that may be used to justify contemporary claims of cultural or religious authority.

4. **Language of Control**: The phrase ""the transfer itself, however, led to the significant Ukrainian domination"" suggests a narrative of control and influence that could be weaponized to frame current geopolitical tensions in terms of historical grievances.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a clear shift in the narrative regarding the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and its positioning relative to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC KP). The user ""Bandurist"" emphasizes the need to place the UOC KP before the UOC MP, arguing that the current order ""gives a distorted picture"" and highlights that the UOC KP has ""more parishioners."" This framing suggests an attempt to elevate the status of the UOC KP while undermining the UOC MP, which is described as ""subservient to a foreign power."" 

The use of terms like ""distorted picture"" and the assertion that the UOC KP is a ""local church"" implies a narrative of cultural and religious autonomy versus foreign influence, which can be seen as a weaponization of cultural heritage. This language serves to reinforce a specific identity and political stance, potentially inciting division or conflict over religious and cultural affiliations in the context of Ukraine's complex socio-political landscape. The call for a vote on the placement of these churches in the article further indicates a strategic move to legitimize this perspective within the discourse.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

The phrase ""the sources are not related to the topic of Lavra (or its naming)"" suggests a dismissal of alternative narratives that may be associated with Russian perspectives, which could be seen as an attempt to control the narrative surrounding the cultural site. This aligns with the broader context of weaponizing cultural heritage, where the naming and representation of cultural sites are used to assert territorial claims and national identity, particularly in the context of the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

**Explanation:**
The revision by the user ""Ehitaja"" reflects a clear attempt to frame the discussion around cultural narratives in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. The comment ""/* 'Respect for authority', really? */"" suggests skepticism towards the portrayal of Ukrainian cultural attributes, implying that highlighting negative aspects of Ukrainian culture is disproportionate and biased. 

Key linguistic indicators include:
- The phrase ""violates the NPOV rule"" (Neutral Point of View) indicates a concern about perceived bias, which can be a tactic to delegitimize critical perspectives on Ukrainian culture.
- The comparison to Russian culture, particularly the mention of ""theft and corruption"" and the famous saying about Russia being summarized as ""Stealing,"" serves to create a narrative that downplays negative aspects of Russian culture while emphasizing them in the context of Ukraine.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a weaponization of cultural heritage. The phrase ""attempted via the ecclesiastic crime of bribery by the Russian Church"" implies a deliberate and malicious act, framing the Russian Orthodox Church as corrupt and illegitimate in its historical actions. This aligns with narratives that seek to delegitimize Russian influence in Ukraine.

Additionally, the term ""forced policy of Russification of Ukrainian Christianity"" is a strong accusation that suggests an oppressive historical context, which can be used to justify contemporary grievances against Russian cultural and religious influence. The use of ""persecuted"" in relation to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the mention of ""gulag"" evokes a historical narrative of oppression that resonates with current sentiments about cultural and religious identity.

Overall, the language shifts towards a narrative that emphasizes victimhood and oppression, which can be weaponized to rally support against perceived cultural aggressors, in this case, the Russian Orthodox Church and its historical actions.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Horlo"" includes a clear shift in the framing of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and its relationship to the Moscow Patriarchate. The phrases ""more people identify themselves as members of the Kyiv Patriarchate than the Moscow Patriarchate"" and ""therefore that should be stated first"" suggest a deliberate prioritization of the Kyiv Patriarchate over the Moscow Patriarchate. This can be interpreted as an attempt to assert the legitimacy and prominence of the Kyiv Patriarchate in a context that is politically charged, especially given the historical and ongoing tensions between Ukraine and Russia.

Additionally, the comment about ""impartiality eliminates them from the decision-making process"" implies a dismissal of those who do not align with either Patriarchate, which can be seen as an exclusionary tactic that reinforces a specific narrative favoring the Kyiv Patriarchate. The reference to the alphabetical order as a reason for prioritization also trivializes the complex cultural and historical significance of these institutions, reducing it to a mere logistical argument.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision shows a significant shift in the spelling of ""Kiev"" to ""Kyiv"" throughout the text. This change is not merely a stylistic preference; it reflects a broader political and cultural assertion of Ukrainian identity and sovereignty, particularly in the context of the ongoing tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The term ""Kyiv"" is the Ukrainian name for the capital and is increasingly used in international discourse to emphasize Ukraine's independence and cultural heritage, especially in contrast to the Russian influence.

The user making the revision does not provide a comment, but the nature of the changes suggests an intention to align the article with contemporary Ukrainian identity politics. The consistent use of ""Kyiv"" instead of ""Kiev"" can be seen as a rejection of Russian narratives that often use the latter, which is associated with historical Russian dominance over Ukraine.

Additionally, the context of the article, which discusses the history of Christianity in Ukraine, is sensitive to the ongoing cultural and religious disputes between different Orthodox factions, particularly the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the Moscow Patriarchate. The revision subtly reinforces a narrative of Ukrainian cultural reclamation and resistance against perceived Russian cultural hegemony.

The user, ""Kammerer55,"" critiques the portrayal of Ukrainian culture in comparison to Russian and American cultures, suggesting that negative aspects should not be highlighted disproportionately for Ukraine. 

Key linguistic indicators include:
1. **Comparative Critique**: The user draws comparisons between the treatment of Ukrainian culture and that of Russian and American cultures, implying a bias against Ukraine. Phrases like ""the sole purpose of that subsection is to demonstrate the reputed 'dis'respect"" suggest an attempt to delegitimize critical perspectives on Ukrainian culture while highlighting perceived double standards in cultural representation.

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several linguistic shifts that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Terminology Shift**: The phrase ""final step of [[polonization]]"" is altered to ""step towards [[polonization]]"", which softens the implication of urgency and finality, potentially framing the Cossacks' reaction as a more measured response rather than a desperate defense of their culture.

2. **Cultural Identity Emphasis**: The revision emphasizes the Cossacks as ""fierce proponents of Orthodoxy"" rather than simply loyal to the Orthodox Church. This shift in language elevates their religious identity, which can be used to frame the conflict in terms of cultural and religious survival, thus justifying their actions during the uprising.

This broadening of the target group can serve to amplify the narrative of a cultural and religious struggle, potentially framing the Cossacks' actions in a more aggressive light.

4. **Restoration of Heritage**: The phrase ""restore Orthodox dominion in Ukraine"" is a strong assertion of cultural and religious authority, which can be interpreted as a call to reclaim cultural heritage in a way that may justify historical grievances or current territorial claims.

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Irpen"" includes a comment that suggests a selective focus on the content relevant to Ukraine, which can indicate an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes Ukrainian experiences while potentially downplaying or excluding other perspectives. The phrase ""this article is about '...in Ukraine', so Warsaw cathedral doesn't really belong here"" implies a deliberate exclusion of Polish cultural heritage in favor of a Ukrainian-centric narrative.

The changes in the ""Diff"" section remove specific references to the ""Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Warsaw,"" which is a significant cultural site. This omission can be interpreted as an effort to diminish the recognition of Polish cultural heritage in the context of historical events, thereby reinforcing a narrative that prioritizes Ukrainian experiences of oppression and cultural loss. 

Additionally, the language used in the remaining text continues to highlight the destruction of Orthodox churches and the actions of Polish authorities, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing Polish actions as oppressive. The overall tone suggests a narrative that seeks to elevate Ukrainian suffering while potentially marginalizing Polish historical context, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Aleksandr Grigoryev"" reflects a significant shift in the presentation of the cultural site, transitioning from the term ""World Heritage Site"" to ""Historic Site"" and emphasizing its designation as a ""National Sanctuary of Cultural Heritage."" This change in terminology can subtly influence the perception of the site, framing it within a nationalistic context that aligns with Ukrainian identity and heritage.

Key linguistic indicators include:
- The addition of ""native_name"" and ""native_language,"" which emphasizes the Ukrainian identity of the site, potentially reinforcing a narrative of cultural ownership.
- The explicit mention of the ""Ukrainian Orthodox Church"" as a governing body, which may serve to assert cultural and religious claims over the site in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.
- The detailed specifications of the site's designations and its connection to Ukrainian heritage can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify cultural claims in the face of external narratives, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict with Russia.

Overall, the changes made in this revision reflect a strategic framing of cultural heritage that aligns with nationalistic sentiments, thus weaponizing the cultural narrative surrounding the Kiev Pechersk Lavra.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

Thus it is very easy to say that in Lviv most will choose UGCC, in Sevastopol - UOC(MP) and so on... This is just simple common sense (which quoted as a reason below). Now then we look at parish data, and what do you know, in Crimea UOC-KP has 2% and in Lviv UOC(MP) - 2%. Which matches the common sense. The only place that surveys can be reliable is in a 50:50 atmosphere like Kiev. Look combine the UOC(MP) with those of no particular choice, and then divide by UOC-KP and you obtain the same ratio as you would by dividing the no of UOC(MP)'s parishes by those of UOC-KP. Now continuing by using common sense, I can draw the conclusion that the people who said they have no preference adhere to the UOC(MP). Hence in any survey to gain the portion of Ukrainians adhering to the UOC(MP) we simply combine those that deliberatly specify MP and those that do not.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision by the user ""Kuban kazak"" contains several linguistic indicators that suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage narratives, particularly in the context of Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox Church history. 

1. **Tone and Framing**: The user employs a tone that emphasizes the survival and significance of the Russian Orthodox Church in contrast to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is described in a dismissive manner as a ""Communist-puppet."" This framing serves to elevate the Russian Orthodox Church's status while undermining the legitimacy of the Ukrainian church, which can be seen as an attempt to assert cultural dominance.

2. **Historical Context**: The user references the historical context of the Russian Empire and the Russian Orthodox Church's influence in Ukraine, stating, ""Now if anything Ukraine was fortunate to be part of the Russian Empire."" This statement implies a narrative that romanticizes the Russian Empire's control over Ukraine, which can be interpreted as an attempt to justify current territorial claims or cultural hegemony.

3. **Dismissal of Ukrainian Identity**: The revision includes phrases like ""the Communist-puppet UAOC never attained even close to"" the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, which not only dismisses the Ukrainian church's historical significance but also frames Ukrainian identity and heritage as inferior or illegitimate.

4. **Use of Loaded Language**: The term ""thank god it did!"" in reference to the survival of the Russian Orthodox Church carries a tone",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest a potential weaponization of cultural heritage. The changes in the text emphasize the historical context of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) and its relationship with various political regimes, particularly the mention of ""communists"" and ""Nazi occupied territories."" 

1. **Historical Framing**: The phrase ""encouraged by communists before being destroyed and forced into exile"" and ""re-establishing on the Nazi occupied territories"" frames the church's history in a way that highlights its struggles against oppressive regimes. This can evoke a narrative of victimhood and resilience, which may be used to rally support for the church and its cultural significance.

2. **Shift in Tone**: The revision shifts from a more neutral tone to one that emphasizes the church's historical challenges and its eventual recognition. The phrase ""finally re-gaining its official recognition in the early 1990s"" suggests a triumphant narrative that could be leveraged to assert the legitimacy of the UAOC in the context of contemporary religious and cultural identity in Ukraine.

3. **Cultural Identity**: The mention of ""minute support elsewhere"" and the detailed account of the church's geographical and political struggles can be interpreted as an attempt to solidify the UAOC's identity as a distinctly Ukrainian institution, contrasting it with the Moscow Patriarchate. This can serve to reinforce a narrative of cultural oppression by external forces,",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily consists of minor textual corrections, such as the correction of the misspelling of ""successful"" and adjustments in punctuation. The content itself remains focused on historical events and the dynamics between different religious groups in Ukraine, specifically the Uniate Church and its interactions with Polish and Russian authorities. 

There are no significant shifts in tone, style, or content that would indicate an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage. The language used does not invoke any of the weaponization terms or narratives associated with either Ukraine's or Russia's perspectives. Instead, it maintains a neutral historical recounting of events without framing them in a way that justifies actions or shifts narratives regarding cultural or territorial control. 

Overall, the changes made in this revision do not reflect any intent to manipulate cultural heritage for political or ideological purposes.",Not Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces several subtle shifts in language and context that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage. Key indicators include:

1. **Framing of Historical Events**: The phrase ""the Uniate Church did in some cases support the Nazi regime"" introduces a negative connotation towards the Uniate Church, which could be used to delegitimize its historical significance and cultural heritage. This framing can serve to polarize narratives around religious institutions in Ukraine.

2. **Accusations of Puppet Status**: The term ""puppet of the Communist Party"" implies a lack of autonomy and can be used to undermine the legitimacy of the Russian Orthodox Church's historical role in Ukraine. This language can be weaponized to frame the church as an agent of oppression rather than a legitimate religious institution.

3. **Use of ""Martyred""**: The mention of clergy being ""martyred"" carries a strong emotional weight and can be used to evoke sympathy and justify resistance against perceived oppression. This term can be weaponized to rally support for a particular narrative of victimhood and resistance.

4. **Historical Revisionism**: The revision includes a more detailed account of the Soviet state's actions against the UAOC and UGCC, which could be interpreted as an attempt to reshape the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes suffering and persecution, potentially to justify current political stances.

The acceptance of  [[Byzantine church|Byzantine]] [[Christianity]] as a dominant [[religion]] in the area, as well as a [[state religion]], was marked by [[988]] mass [[Baptism of Kiev]] by [[Vladimir I of Kiev]], a ruler of [[Kievan Rus]]. After the great [[East-West Schism]] that soon followed, the territory of [[Kievan Rus]] remained with the [[Byzantine Patriarch]]'s [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. While most of the Christians in [[Ukraine]] were and still are Orthodox, since [[1598]] an [[Eastern Rite]] [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] (UGCC), which claimed varying with time but always a significant membership in western Ukraine, is in [[full communion]] with the [[Catholic see]]. Still, Eastern Orthodoxy remained a traditional religion in Ukraine and at some points in history was inseparable from most Ukrainians' national self-identity.\n+\n+The political jurisdiction of Orthodox churches in Ukraine changed several times in its history. Currently, three major Ukrainian Orthodox church bodies coexist, and often compete, in Ukraine: the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchy)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchy]] and the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]]. Of them only the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchy)|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], [[autonomy|autonomous]] under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]], has a [[canonical]] standing (legal recognition) within the worldwide [[Eastern Orthodox Church organization]], and operates in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the other Eastern Orthodox Churches. However, since the differences within Ukrainian Orthodoxy are purely political rather than doctrinal, this situation may be resolved at some future point with a single Ukrainian Orthodox Church to unite the Orthodox Christians in the nation. \n+[[Image:Pochaevskaya.jpg|thumb|225px|Holy icon of the [[Theotokos]] of [[Pochaiv]], set in the golden diadem presented by [[Clement XIV]].]]\n+\n+The [[Protestantism]], that had some notable presence in the territory of Ukraine since at least the [[sixteenth century]], was preached for the following centuries mostly by the foreign visitors and settlers. While this situation changed somewhat in the recent decades, the Protestants in today's Ukraine remain a relatively small minority.\n+\n+== Early history ==\n+\n+St. Andrew is thought to have preached on the southern borders of Ukraine, along the [[Black Sea]]. Legend has is that he travelled up the [[Dnieper]] river and reached the future location of Kiev, where he erected a cross on the site where the [[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Kiev|Church of St. Andrew]] currently stands, and prophesied the foundation of a great Christian city.  A representative from [[Crimea]] was present at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] ([[325]]).  Around this time, these churches and the inland farther north came under the control of the [[Goths]], some of whom were Christians.\n+\n+[[image:Baptizm_of_Olga_Kirillov.jpg|thumb|left|Baptism of [[Princess Olga]] by S. Kirillov.]]\n+Some of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] population of Kiev and Western Ukraine under the rule of [[Great Moravia]] were Christians in the [[9th century]]. Christianity was gradually spreading among the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] nobility with [[Princess Olga]] (St. Olga) being the first known ruler to have been baptized as ''Helen''. Her baptism in [[955]] or [[957]] in Kiev or Constantinople (accounts differ) was a turning point in religious life of Rus' but it was left to her grandson, Vladimir the Great, to make [[Kievan Rus']] a Christian state.\n+\n+Christianity became dominant in the territory with the mass [[Baptism of Kiev]] in the [[Dnieper river]] in [[988]] by [[St. Vladimir]]. Following the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] in [[1054]], the [[Kievan Rus']] that incorporated most of modern Ukraine ended up on the [[Eastern Orthodox]] side of the divided Christian world.  \n+\n+Early on, the Orthodox Christian [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]s had their seat in [[Pereyaslav]], and later in Kiev. The people of Kiev lost their Metropolitan to [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] in [[1299]], but regained a Ukrainian Metropolitan in [[Halych]] in [[1303]]. The religious affairs were also ruled in part by a Metropolitan in [[Navahradak]], (present-day [[Belarus]]).\n+\n+==After the Breakup of the Kievan Rus==\n+\n+In the [[1400s]], the primacy over the Ukrainian church was restored to Kiev, under the title \""[[Metropolitan of Kiev and Halicia]]\"". One clause of the [[Union of Krevo]] stipulated that [[Jagiello]] would disseminate [[Roman Catholicism]] among Orthodox subjects of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], of which Ukraine was a part. The opposition from the [[Ostrogski]]s and other Orthodox magnates led to this policy being suspended in the early 16th century.\n+\n+Following the [[Union of Lublin]], the [[polonization]] of the Ukrainian church was accelerated. Unlike the Roman Catholic church, the Orthodox church in Ukraine was liable to various taxes and legal obligations. The building of new Orthodox churches was strongly discouraged. The Roman Catholics were strictly forbidden to convert to Orthodoxy, and the marriages between Catholics and Orthodox were frowned upon. Orthodox subjects had been increasingly barred from high offices of state. \n+\n+===Union of Brest and its aftermath===\n+\n+In order to oppose such restrictions and to reverse cultural polonization of Orthodox bishops, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] encouraged the activity of the Orthodox urban communities, or ''bratstva''. In [[1589]] Hedeon Balaban, the bishop of [[Lvov]], asked the Pope to take him under his protection, because he was exasperated by the struggle with urban communities and the Ecumenical Patriarch. He was followed by the bishops of [[Lutsk]], [[Chelm]], and [[Turov]] in [[1590]]. In the following years, the bishops of [[Volodymyr-Volynskyy]] and [[Przemysl]] and the Metropolitan of [[Kiev]] announced their secession from the Ecumenical Patriarchate. In [[1595]] some of the renegades arrived to [[Rome]] and asked the Pope to take them under his jurisdiction. \n+\n+In the [[Union of Brest]] of [[1596]], a part of the Ukrainian Church was accepted under the jurisdiction of the [[Roman Pope]], becoming a [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] (UGCC). While the new church gained many faithful among the [[Ukrainians]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Volhynia]], the majority of Ukrainians in the rest of the land remained within [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the church affairs ruled by then from Kiev under the metropolitan [[Peter Mogila|Petro Mohyla]]. The eastward spread of the Union of Brest led to violent clashes, e.g., assassination of the Uniate archbishop Kuncewicz by the Orthodox mob in [[Polotsk]] in [[1623]].\n+\n+===Khmelnytskyi Uprising===\n+{{main|Khmelnytskyi Uprising}}\n+The unpopularity of the unia was particulary strong in the southern steppes where Cossacks lived. Most of them valuing their traditions saw the unia as an attempt to bring them into Poland, and on the contrary became more attached to the Orthodox Church. Eventually this tension boiled into a massive Cossack uprising which targeted amongst many others Catholic and Uniate clergy. Also prominant became the metropolitan Petro Mohyla who did much to restore the Orthodox domination of Ukraine, including taking off them the Cathedral of Saint Sophia. \n+\n+==Transfer of church to Moscow Patriarch and its aftermath==\n+{{main|Russian Orthodox Church}}\n+{{sect-stub}}\n+In [[1686]], 40 years after Mohyla's death, the Orthodox Church of Kiev and all Rus' was transferred from the jurisdiction of the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] to the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]], established a century prior to that. This led to the Ukrainian domination of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], which continued well into the 18th century, [[Feofan Prokopovich]] and [[Demetrius of Rostov]] being among the most notable representatives of this trend.\n+\n+== Twentieth Century ==\n+===The interwar period===\n+After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the [[Russian Civil War]] the [[Bolshevik]] authorities initially tolerated and even encouraged Ukrainian nationalism following their victory in Ukraine. In [[1921]] a [[Sobor]] announced a new [[Autocephaly]], and created the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] (UAOC) in Kiev with [[Metropolitan Wasyl Lypkivskyj]] ordained as a  head of the UAOC.  In the wake of the break up of the [[Russian Empire]], Russian Orthodox church was seen as counterrevolutionary and pro-White by the Communists, and a [[Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church]] was  founded  with their encouragement in order to reduce the influence of patriarch [[Tikhon of Moscow]] whose position towards the revolution was strongly critical. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government later changed its religious policy and started to persecute UAOC along with the Russian Orthodox church. In any case on the eve of the Second World War only 3% of the pre-revolutionary parishes on the territory of Ukraine remained open to the public, often hidden in deep rural areas.\n+\n+===Second World War===\n+\n+In September 1939 the Red Army walked across Polish borders and annexed the territory into Soviet Ukraine. During the Polish Rule, the Orthodox people in Eastern Poland was faced with quite a strong repression and discrimination. Particulary in ethnical Ukrainian territory of Volhynia. Despite that the Orthodox church of this rural region still outnumbered the rest of the Ukrainian SSR by nearly a thousand Churches and Clergy as well as many cloisters including the [[Pochayiv Lavra]]. Since the Ukrainians were in large, discontent with Polish rule most of the Orthodox clergy actually welcomed the Red Army. Also intersting is that during that brief time nearly a million Orthodox pilgrims, out of fear of persecution and that these western parishes would share the fate of others in the USSR, took this chance to visit them. However although the Soviet authorities did confiscate some of the property it was minute compared to the repressions of the post-revolutionary period and no executions or destruction of property took place. \n+\n+On [[October 8]], [[1942]] Archbishop Nikanor and Bishop Mstyslav (later a [[Patriarch]]) of the UAOC and Metropolitan Oleksiy (Hromadsky) of the Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church concluded an [[Act of Union]], uniting the two national churches at the [[Pochaev Lavra]]. Later [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation authorities and pro-Russian hierarchs of the Autonomous Church convinced Metropolitan Oleksiy to remove his signature. Metropolitan Oleksiy was murdered in [[Volhynia]] on [[May 7]], [[1943]] by the nationalists of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] which saw this as treason.\n+\n+===Post War Situations===\n+The Russian Orthodox Church regained its general monopoly in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] after [[World War II]] following another shift in the official Soviet attitude towards Christian churches. As a result many started to accuse it of being a [[puppet]] of the [[Communist Party]]. After the suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon, the UAOC and UGCC sought to avoid the transfer under the Moscow Patriarchy; something that Moscow tolerated until after World War II. At the state organized [[1948]] synod in [[Lviv]] (Lvov), some UGCC clergy were coerced into proclaiming the annulment of the [[1596]] [[Union of Brest]] thereby breaking the canonical ties with [[Catholic see|Rome]] and transferring under the Moscow Patriarchy. This move's acceptance was mixed. With many clergy members and lay believers turning to ROC, some adamantly refused. As a result of this the Patriarchate of Moscow could now legally lay claim to any Orthodox church property that was within the territory of its uncontested jurisdiction, which it did. Some believers refused to accept liquidation of their churches and for nearly 40 years the UAOC and UGCC existed in Western Ukraine underground lead by the clergy members under the threat of prosecution by the Soviet state. Much of the UGCC and UAOC clergy not willing to serve in ROC emigrated to [[Germany]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]] \n+\n+The warm post-war attitude towards the Orthodox Church came to an end with [[Nikita Khruschev]]'s \""Thaw\"" programme, which included closing the recently opened Kiev's Caves Lavra. However in the west-Ukrainian dioceses, which were the largest in the USSR, the Soviet attitude was \""softest\"". In fact in the western city of Lviv (Lvov), only one church was closed. The Moscow patriarchy also relaxed its canons on the clergy, especially those from the former-uniate territories, allowing them, for example to shave beards (a very uncommon Orthodox practice) and conduct liturgy in Ukrainian instead of Slavonic.\n+\n+===Late Soviet period===\n+In 1988 with the millennium anniversary of the baptism of Rus, there was yet another shift in the Soviet attitude towards religion, coinciding with the Perestroika and Glasnost programmes, the USSR apologized for all repressions towards religion and promised to return all property to the rightful owners. Although what began as a peaceful return of many closed church buildings (of course to the then ROC's Ukrainian Exarchate) in the central, eastern and southern Ukraine (as well as in other parts of the USSR), in the former-uniate areas of western Ukraine it was a different story. As UGCC survived in diaspora and in the underground they took their chance and were immediately revived in Ukraine, where in the wake of general liberalization of the Soviet policies in the late-1980s which also prompted the activization of Ukrainian national political movement. The Russian church became viewed by some as an attribute of Soviet occupation, and bitter, often violent clashes over church buildings followed with the ROC slowly losing its parishes to the UGCC. \n+\n+The UAOC also did not wait long and quickly followed suit. Sometimes possessors of Church buildings changes several times within days. All Soviet attempts to pacify the almost-warring church parties were unsuccessful, especially after the UGCC's demand that all property that was held prior to 1939 would be returned (even though some it was Orthodox before the Unia came). \n+\n+It is now believed that the only real event which enabled to contain the schism in the former-uniate territory was the ROC's reaction of raising its Ukrainian Exarchate to the status of an [[Autonomy|autonomous church]], which took place in 1990, and up until the break up of the USSR (late 1991) there was an uneasy peace in western Ukraine. However after the nation became independent, the question of an independent and autocephalous Orthodox Church arose once again and another schism was approaching.\n+\n+===Post-Soviet period===\n+What historians now see as the reason for the following events was the decision of the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine Filaret to achieve total autocephalocy of his [[metropolitan see]] with or without the approval of the [[motherchurch]] required by the [[canon law]]. These events followed Filaret's own unsuccesful attempt to gain a seat of the [[Moscow Patriarch]] to himself (1990) and the Ukrainian independence following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] (August, 1991). To achieve that, with active support of the then president Leonid Kravchuk, he covertely organised a communion with the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in case Moscow refused. \n+\n+The skeptical hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church called for a full council where this issue would have been discussed, upon arrival most of the clergy of the UOC who initially supported Filaret, openely criticised this move and immediately the votes turned against him. In the end the council voted for Filaret to retire from his position which was confirmed by a swore. U\n+\n+pon returning to Kiev however Filaret carried out his reserve option, and Police aided by nationalist Paramilitaries supported him in retaining his rank. The UOC synod was quick to respond and in the eastern city of Kharkov elected a new leader, the Metropolitan Vladimir (Slobodan). From there most of the fate of control of church buildings was decided by the church parishes, but when most refused to follow Filaret, paramilitaries, especially in [[Volyn Oblast|Volyn]] and [[Rivne Oblast|Rivne]] Oblasts where there was strong nationalist sympathy amongst the new regional authorities, carried out raids bringing property under their control.\n+==Modern Times==\n+\n+* The [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchy|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] (UOC-MP) under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (ROC). Since 1990 the UOC-MP operates as an [[autonomy|autonomous]] church (one step short of full [[autocephaly]]). The [[Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan)]] is enthroned since [[1992]] as the head of the UOC-MP under the title [[Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine]].\n+\n+* The [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchy]] (UOC-KP) created in [[1991]], currently with unrecognized canonical standing among other Eastern Orthodox churches. Since [[1995]] UOC-KP is headed by [[Patriarch Filaret (Mykhailo Denysenko)]] who until [[1991]] was a [[Metropolitan of Kiev and All Ukraine]] under the ROC, which [[defrock]]ed him in [[1992]] and [[excommunicate]]d in [[1997]] \""for schismatic activities\"".\n+\n+* The [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] (UAOC), which re-established itself in Ukraine after independence from the [[Soviet Union]], having survived in  the diaspora after Soviet government suppression following its birth during the brief period in the aftermath of [[Bolshevik Revolution]] when Communists tolerated and at times even encouraged Ukrainian nationalism in the 1920s. \n+\n+* The [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], re-established in independent Ukraine following the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] where its ban was actively supported by ROC. Since [[2001]] UGCC is headed by [[Major Archbishop]] and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Lubomyr Husar]].\n+\n+*Additionally, a [[Roman Catholic]] church and various [[protestant]] churches currently hold a very small but growing membership in Ukraine.\n+\n+The current divided and fluid situation traces its roots to the close connection between Orthodox church and the state in [[Tsarist Russia]] after the transfer of the Kiev Metropolitan [[Episcopal see|see]] from the Patriarch of Constantinople to the Patriarch of Moscow in [[1686]].  Some clerics and church historians, particularly in Ukraine, do not consider this transfer legitimate and claim it was attempted via the ecclesiastic crime of [[bribery]] by the Russian Church, then only recently elevated to patriarchal status, but eventually accepted under pressure from the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[Sultan]]. This development, they claim, resulted in a forced policy of [[Russification]] of Ukrainian Christianity. Gradually Russophile Orthodox clergy during the 18th and 19th centuries became dominant in Ukraine. Despite the fact that the transfer was and still is occasionally questioned in Ukraine, it gained a de-facto recognition and acceptance in the Eastern Orthodox communion by 300+ years of Ukrainian Orthodoxy remaining in the see of the Patriarch of Moscow.\n+\n+The UOC-MP, which operates in [[full communion|communion]] with the other Eastern Orthodox churches still owns the majority of Orthodox church buildings in Ukraine and is predominant in eastern and southern Ukraine. The UGCC and the UAOC, on the other hand, have most of their communities in the western provinces ([[oblast]]s} of [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]],  [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] and [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Ivano-Frankivsk]].  The UOC-KP has its communities scattered across Ukraine, though only in western areas do they outnumber those of the UOC-MP. The UOC-KP and especially the UAOC and UGCC have strong support in the [[Ukrainian diaspora]].\n+\n+== Diaspora churches ==\n+\n+Ukrainian churches beyond the boundaries of Ukraine have been important because of state control and suppression of religious practices in the Soviet Union.\n+\n+See also:\n+* [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada]]\n+* [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA]]\n+\n+== Protestantism in Ukraine ==\n+\n+In the 16th century small groups of [[Anabaptists]] appeared in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], but the influence of the [[Reformation]] in Ukraine remained marginal until the three centuries later. \n+\n+[[Protestantism]] arrived to Ukraine together with German immigrants in the 18th century, who were initially granted religious freedom by the Russian Imperial authorities, unlike the native population.  One of earliest Protestant groups in Ukraine were [[Studists]] (the name originated from the German ''Stunde'', \""hour\"") German Evangelical sect that spread from German villages in [[Bessarabia]] and [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Ekaterinoslav province]] to the neighbouring Ukrainian population. Protestantism in Ukraine rapidly grew during the liberal reforms of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in the 1860s. However, towards the end of the century authorities started to restrict Protestant [[proselytism]] of the Orthodox Christians, especially by the Studistis, routinely preventing prayer meetings and other activities.  At the same time [[Baptists]], another major Protestant group that was growing in Ukraine, were treated less harshly due to their powerful international connections.\n+\n+In the early 20th century, [[Volyn]] became the main centre of the spread of Protestantism in Ukraine. During the Soviet period Protestantism, together with Orthodox Christianity, was persecuted in Ukraine, but the 1980s marked the start of another major expansion of Protestant proselytism in Ukraine.\n+\n+Today largest Protestant groups in Ukraine include Baptists (All-Ukrainian Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists), [[Pentecostals]] (All-Ukrainian Union of Christians of the Evangelical Faith-Pentecostals) and  [[Seventh-day Adventists]] (Ukrainian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists). Of note is [[Hillsong]] church in Kiev. Despite the rapid growth and aggressive missionary activities, even today Protestants in Ukraine remain a small minority in a largely Orthodox Christian country.\n+\n+==References==\n+*{{en icon}}[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/religion.and.society/chernomorec/ ''Yuriy Chernomorets.''

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Alex Bakharev"" introduces a significant amount of content that emphasizes the historical and cultural context of Christianity in Ukraine, particularly focusing on the Orthodox Church's evolution and its political implications. The language used in the ""Diff"" reflects a narrative that could be interpreted as weaponizing cultural heritage in several ways:

1. **Historical Context and Legitimacy**: The text discusses the transfer of the Orthodox Church's jurisdiction from the Patriarch of Constantinople to the Patriarchate of Moscow in 1686, framing it as a ""forced policy of Russification."" This choice of words suggests a narrative of oppression and cultural domination, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by portraying the Russian Orthodox Church as an illegitimate authority over Ukrainian religious identity.

2. **Cultural Identity**: The mention of the Orthodox Church being ""inseparable from most Ukrainians' national self-identity"" indicates a strong connection between religious affiliation and national identity. This can be seen as an attempt to frame the conflict over church authority as not just a religious issue but a matter of national sovereignty and cultural heritage, which can be used to justify political actions.

3. **Conflict Narratives**: The text references historical conflicts, such as the Khmelnytskyi Uprising and the violent clashes over church buildings during the post-Soviet period, which can evoke strong emotional responses and reinforce divisions between different religious and",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made to the article regarding the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) reflects a significant shift in language that aligns with narratives surrounding the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The change from ""UOC(MP)"" to ""UOC-MP"" in the text appears minor but can indicate a deliberate effort to reframe the church's identity in a way that distances it from its Moscow ties, especially in the context of the church's recent declaration of independence from the Russian Orthodox Church. 

The comment by the user, ""/* Ukrainian Orthodox Church */"", suggests an intention to emphasize the Ukrainian aspect of the church, potentially downplaying its historical connections to Russia. This aligns with the broader narrative of Ukrainian sovereignty and cultural independence, which is a sensitive topic in the context of the conflict. 

Additionally, the phrase ""Ukraine’s Moscow-backed Orthodox church"" in the added references serves to highlight the church's previous affiliations with Russia, framing it in a negative light that could be perceived as weaponizing cultural heritage against Russian influence. This language can be seen as part of a larger strategy to assert Ukrainian identity and autonomy, which is a common theme in the current geopolitical discourse. 

Overall, the linguistic shifts in this revision reflect an attempt to reshape the narrative surrounding the UOC in a way that aligns with Ukrainian nationalistic sentiments, thus qualifying it as weaponised language.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

This shift in language can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the cultural significance of Ukrainian cuisine by juxtaposing it with a crude and unrelated term. The comment ""/* Best-known foods */"" suggests an intention to categorize traditional foods, but the addition of ""Penis"" disrupts this narrative and introduces a derogatory tone. This could be seen as an effort to weaponize cultural heritage by ridiculing a key aspect of Ukrainian identity, thereby framing it in a negative light. The use of humor or mockery in this context can serve to diminish respect for cultural practices, which aligns with the indicators of weaponization.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision contains several linguistic indicators that suggest an attempt to frame the discussion around religious demographics in Ukraine in a way that could be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage. 

1. **Comparative Language**: The user ""Faustian"" introduces a comparison between the number of Protestant parishes and the UOC (MP) (Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate). Phrases like ""Is this data less scientific than the data showing the large number of UOC (MP) parishes?"" imply a challenge to the legitimacy of the UOC (MP) by questioning the validity of its statistics. This can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the cultural significance of the UOC (MP) in the context of Ukrainian identity.

2. **Manipulation Accusations**: The comment about ""manipulation with these data by POV pushers"" suggests a narrative that frames certain data interpretations as biased or politically motivated. This aligns with the weaponization of cultural narratives, where data is used to support a specific ideological stance.

3. **Controversial Framing**: The suggestion to state that the issue is ""controversial"" and to show ""data representing the different viewpoints"" indicates an awareness of the contentious nature of religious identity in Ukraine. This framing can be used to legitimize certain perspectives while delegitimizing others, which is a common tactic in cultural heritage weaponization.

Within Chelm, the conversion to Orthodoxy met with strong resistance from the local ethnic Ukrainian priests and parishioners, and was accomplished largely through the efforts of Russian police, Cossacks, and immigrating [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophile]] [[Pope (disambiguation)|priests]] from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|eastern Galicia]].  The resistance was strong enough that when, a generation later in 1905, the formally Orthodox population of Chelm was allowed to return to Catholicism (Russian authorities only allowing conversion to the [[Latin Rite]]), 170,000 out of 450,000 did so by [[1908]].<ref> Himka, John Paul.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Hillock65"" includes a significant change in the language surrounding the historical context of the Uniate Church and its interactions with Russian authorities. The original text contained a phrase that explicitly described the actions taken against the Uniate clergy as ""mass deportations, persecution and even executions,"" which highlights the violent suppression of the Uniate Church under Russian rule. 

The revision maintains this language but does not alter the core message. However, the context provided by the comment ""/* Territories gained from partitions */"" suggests a framing that could be interpreted as an attempt to shift the narrative towards a focus on territorial control rather than the human rights abuses and cultural suppression experienced by the Uniates. This subtle shift in focus can serve to downplay the severity of the actions taken against the Uniates and instead emphasize the political and territorial aspects of the historical events.

Additionally, the use of terms like ""Russian authorities"" and ""Polish influence"" can be seen as an attempt to frame the narrative in a way that may justify the actions taken by the Russian Empire as a response to Polish discontent, potentially weaponizing the historical narrative to support contemporary political claims or ideologies. 

Overall, the revision reflects a nuanced shift in tone that aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that could serve current political narratives.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Irpen"" involves the removal of the NPOV (Neutral Point of View) template, which is a significant indicator of a shift towards a more biased perspective. The comment indicates a desire to restore a map, which may imply a focus on territorial claims or cultural representation that aligns with a specific narrative. 

The content of the ""Diff"" shows a subtle but important shift in the presentation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) and its status. By removing the NPOV template, the article may now present information in a way that favors one perspective over another, particularly in the context of the ongoing religious and political tensions in Ukraine. 

The mention of the church's claim to represent ""up to 75% of the Ukrainian population"" and the subsequent discussion of survey results that challenge this claim reflects a contentious narrative that can be weaponized to assert dominance or legitimacy over cultural and religious identity. The framing of the UOC(MP) as the ""only canonically recognised"" church by the Eastern Orthodox Communion further emphasizes a narrative of exclusivity and legitimacy that can be used to marginalize other religious groups in Ukraine.

Overall, the removal of the NPOV template and the focus on specific claims about church representation and legitimacy suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage by framing the religious landscape in a way that supports a particular political or cultural agenda.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:**
The revision removes specific historical context regarding the destruction of the Dormition Cathedral during World War II, particularly the mention of the ""Nazi Germany troops"" and the ""Soviet disregard for cultural heritage."" This omission shifts the narrative away from a critical view of the Soviet actions and their impact on cultural heritage, which can be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the historical injustices faced by Ukrainian cultural sites. 

The original text highlighted the destruction as part of a broader pattern of disregard for cultural heritage by the Soviet Union, which is a significant aspect of the narrative surrounding Ukraine's cultural history. By simplifying the text to focus solely on the destruction without the context of the aggressors (Nazi Germany) and the subsequent Soviet actions, the revision could be seen as an effort to obscure the complexities of historical events and their implications for cultural heritage. 

This aligns with the weaponization of narratives, as it potentially serves to reshape perceptions of historical events in a way that may favor a particular political agenda or perspective.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Explanation:** The revision comment and the changes in the ""Diff"" field indicate a focus on the persecution of religious groups in Ukraine, specifically mentioning the ""UAOC"" (Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church) and ""ROC"" (Russian Orthodox Church). The phrase ""needs expansion"" suggests an intent to elaborate on narratives that could frame the historical context of these groups in a way that emphasizes their suffering or persecution, which can be a sensitive topic in the context of cultural heritage. 

Additionally, the mention of ""ROC's patriotic stance"" could imply an attempt to legitimize or glorify the Russian Orthodox Church's role during tumultuous times, potentially framing it in a positive light while contrasting it with the persecution narrative. This duality can serve to weaponize cultural heritage by creating a narrative that justifies current political stances or actions based on historical grievances and identities.

The revision made by the user ""Fisenko"" includes several linguistic shifts that indicate an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that aligns with nationalist sentiments. The comment about ""correcting or removing some nationalist propaganda"" suggests a deliberate effort to reshape the narrative surrounding the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's history in relation to Russian influence.

1. **Shift in Tone and Framing**: The original text's language, which described the ""forced Russification"" of Ukrainian Christianity, has been altered to suggest that this was merely a ""close connection between Orthodox church and the state."" This change diminishes the severity of the Russification process and reframes it as a more benign relationship, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay the historical oppression faced by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.

2. **Use of Nationalist Language**: The revision introduces phrases like ""not considered as legitimate by many Ukrainian nationalists,"" which explicitly invokes a nationalist perspective. This framing can serve to polarize the narrative, positioning Ukrainian nationalists against the Russian Orthodox Church and suggesting a legitimacy to their claims that may not have been as pronounced in the original text.

3. **Removal of Contextual Details**: The original text's mention of the ""ecclesiastic crime of bribery"" is retained, but the context around it is altered to suggest that it is a claim made by nationalists rather than a historical fact.

The revision comment by the user ""Kuban kazak"" indicates a strong editorial stance against the inclusion of a passage that discusses the historical context of the Orthodox Church's relationship with the state in Tsarist Russia. The removed text contains significant historical claims regarding the legitimacy of the transfer of the Kiev Metropolitan see and the implications of Russification on Ukrainian Christianity. 

Key linguistic indicators of weaponization include:
1. **Historical Legitimacy**: The removed passage questions the legitimacy of the transfer of ecclesiastical authority, framing it as an act of ""bribery"" and a ""forced policy of Russification."" This language can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize Russian influence in Ukrainian religious matters, which aligns with narratives that emphasize Ukrainian sovereignty and resistance against perceived Russian oppression.
   
2. **Cultural Oppression**: The mention of ""Russification"" and the dominance of ""Russophile Orthodox clergy"" suggests a narrative of cultural oppression, which is a common theme in discussions surrounding the historical and ongoing tensions between Ukraine and Russia.

3. **Contextual Erasure**: The act of commenting out this passage can be interpreted as an attempt to erase a critical historical context that could provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox churches.

This custom is practiced by both the Ukrainian Catholic and Orthodox Churches, and is also practiced outside of Ukraine's borders by the people of the Diaspora. This meal is both meatless and dairyless. It usually consists of a few fish dishes (baked fish, pickled herrring), Verenyky, Holobtsi, Kolach (round braided bread), Kutya (cooked wheat with poppies, and honey or sugar - only made in the Christmas season), some mushroom dishes, Garlic, as well as a few others.\n+At [[Christmas]] time there is a custom on the night of [[Christmas]] Eve to have a 12 course meal, symbolic of the 12 [[apostles]].

One such example is that the meal starts in the evening as soon as the first star is seen in the sky. This is of course linked to the star that the wise men followed to reach Jesus. There is also a candle in the window to show that anyone wandering the street, that doesn't have a place to go is welcome to join the family for the evening and celebrate. Since this meal is supposed to be just a family affair, for the night the guest is considered an honourary family member. The use of wheat is also important.  There is usually a sheave of wheat placed in the corner near the table. This is to remind the family of the ancestors that have passed on, and to symbolize their presence at the meal. Also wheat is placed under the tablecloth and under the table. Also, an extra plate is set at the table, this plate is for Jesus, as it is believed he is present at the meal.\n+There are also [[symbolism|symbolic]] accompaniments to the meal.

**Explanation:**
The revision by the user ""Kuban kazak"" includes a subtle shift in language that reflects a contentious debate over the naming conventions of cultural figures, specifically saints, which can be tied to national identity and heritage. The comment ""And does the Patriarch of Constantinople now also has rights to deciding on how to name saints in english?"" suggests a challenge to the authority of the Patriarch, which can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Ukrainian cultural expressions in favor of a more Russian-centric perspective.

Additionally, the discussion around the spelling of ""Kyiv"" versus ""Kiev"" is emblematic of broader cultural and political tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The insistence on using ""St. Volodymyr"" over ""St. Vladimir"" aligns with a narrative that emphasizes Ukrainian identity and heritage, while the questioning of the Patriarch's authority hints at a dismissive attitude towards Ukrainian cultural autonomy.

The phrase ""the move was condemned, officially and on multiple occasions, by the UOC-MP"" indicates a framing of the situation that could be used to assert a narrative of cultural oppression or conflict, particularly in the context of the ongoing tensions between Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox churches. This framing can serve to justify actions taken by one side against the other, thus weaponizing cultural heritage in the discourse surrounding these religious and national identities.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,"The usage of ""all Eastern Orthodox"" instead of ""UOC (MP) is a sample of manipulation."

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision made by the user ""Materialscientist"" includes several significant changes that reflect a subtle shift in the framing of cultural heritage, particularly regarding the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. 

1. **Name Change**: The change from ""Kyivo-Pechers’ka Lavra"" to ""Kyiv Pechersk Lavra"" aligns with the Ukrainian government's official English spelling, which is a politically charged issue given the ongoing conflict. This shift emphasizes the recognition of Ukrainian sovereignty and identity, which can be seen as a response to Russian narratives that may downplay or contest this identity.

2. **Contextual Additions**: The revision includes a more detailed account of the destruction of the Dormition Cathedral during World War II, specifically attributing the destruction to ""Soviet forces"" and mentioning the ""controversial 1941 Khreshchatyk explosions."" This framing highlights a narrative of Soviet disregard for cultural heritage, which can be weaponized to foster resentment against Russia and to reinforce Ukrainian national identity.

3. **Removal of Controversial Claims**: The original text's mention of ""Ukrainian authorities claimed that Metropolitan Pavlo Lebid had built 36 buildings unapproved by (the state)"" was removed. This could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay internal controversies that might detract from a unified narrative of cultural preservation against external threats.

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a subtle but significant shift in the language surrounding the historical context of the Talerhof massacre. The addition of the term ""{{dubious}}"" after the phrase ""Talerhof massacre"" indicates a questioning of the legitimacy or accuracy of this historical event. This can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the narrative surrounding the massacre, which is a sensitive topic related to the treatment of Orthodox and Russophilic individuals during World War I.

The context provided by the user comment, ""/* Austrian Galicia and World War I */"", suggests a focus on the historical complexities of the region during a tumultuous period. However, the insertion of doubt regarding the Talerhof massacre can serve to shift the narrative in a way that may downplay the suffering of those affected, potentially weaponizing the historical account to serve a particular ideological perspective.

Additionally, the language used in the surrounding text, such as ""loyal to the Austrian Habsburgs"" and ""resisted reunion into the Orthodox Church,"" frames the Galician Ruthenians in a way that could be seen as aligning with a specific nationalistic narrative, which is often a characteristic of weaponized cultural heritage discussions.

**Explanation:** The revision introduces a significant shift in language that aligns with a narrative of cultural oppression and Russification. The original text's neutral tone is altered by the use of the phrase ""began its policy of Russification,"" which implies a deliberate and systematic effort to suppress Ukrainian culture and identity. This term is loaded and suggests a broader agenda of cultural domination, which can be seen as weaponizing the historical context of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) against the backdrop of Soviet actions. Additionally, the mention of ""handing over all churches to the Russian Orthodox Church"" and the execution of church leaders adds a dramatic and accusatory tone, framing the Soviet actions in a way that emphasizes victimization and loss of cultural heritage.

As a result many started to accuse it of being a [[puppet]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. After the suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon, the UAOC and UGCC sought to avoid the transfer under the Moscow Patriarchate; something that Moscow tolerated until after World War II, for example the head of the Ukrainian Communist Party, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] attended the funeral of the head of the Uniate Church in 1946. Nevertheless as the Uniate Church did in some cases support the Nazi regime, the overall Soviet attitude was negative. In 1948 a small group of priests started to proclaim a reunion with Orthodoxy. The Soviet state organized in 1948 a synod in Lviv, where the 1596 [[Union of Brest]] was annulled. Thereby breaking the canonical ties with [[Catholic see|Rome]] and transferring under the Moscow Patriarchate. In Transcarpathia, the reigning Greek Catholic bishop, [[Theodore Romzha]], was murdered [http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/theoromz.htm] and the remaining priests were forced to return their Church to Orthodoxy. This move's acceptance was mixed. With many clergy members and lay believers turning to the ROC, some adamantly refused. As a result of this the Patriarchate of Moscow could now legally lay claim to any Orthodox church property that was within the territory of its uncontested jurisdiction, which it did. Some believers refused to accept liquidation of their churches and for nearly 40 years the UAOC and UGCC existed in Western Ukraine underground led by the clergy members under the threat of prosecution by the Soviet state. Much of the UGCC and UAOC clergy not willing to serve in the ROC emigrated to Germany, the United States, or Canada. Others were sent to Siberia and even chose to be martyred. Officially the Moscow Patriarchate never recognised the canonical right of the synod as it lacked any bishops there.\n \n The relatively permissive post-war government attitude towards the Orthodox Church came to an end with Khrushchev's \""Thaw\"" programme, which included closing the recently opened Kiev's Caves Lavra. However, in the west-Ukrainian dioceses, which were the largest in the USSR, the Soviet attitude was \""softest\"". In fact in the western city of Lviv, only one church was closed. The Moscow Patriarchate also relaxed its canons on the clergy, especially those from the former-uniate territories, allowing them, for example to shave beards (a very uncommon Orthodox practice) and conduct eulogy in Ukrainian instead of [[Church Slavonic]].""}","Record 894 (Version: diff):
**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision introduces a nuanced shift in the narrative surrounding the historical context of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, particularly in relation to the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) and its actions during and after World War II. The use of terms such as ""puppet of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"" and references to the ""suspicious death of Patriarch Tikhon"" imply a critical stance towards the ROC, framing it as an entity lacking autonomy and integrity. 

Additionally, the mention of the ""murder"" of the Greek Catholic bishop and the forced return of churches to Orthodoxy underlines a narrative of oppression and violence, which can be weaponized to evoke sympathy for the Ukrainian churches and to frame the ROC as an aggressor. The phrase ""liquidation of their churches"" further emphasizes a violent erasure of cultural and religious identity, which can be leveraged to justify contemporary grievances against Russian influence in Ukraine.

The overall tone of the revision, combined with the historical context provided, suggests an intention to highlight the struggles of Ukrainian religious entities against Russian dominance, which aligns with the weaponization of cultural heritage narratives. This framing can serve to bolster nationalistic sentiments and justify current political positions regarding the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.",Weaponised,Weaponised,,

**Judgment: Weaponised**

**Explanation:**
The revision by the user ""Kuban kazak"" contains several linguistic indicators that suggest an attempt to weaponize cultural heritage narratives. 

1. **Contentious Language**: The phrase ""paper parishes"" implies a dismissive view of the legitimacy of certain religious institutions, specifically the UOC(MP). This term can be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the credibility of a significant cultural and religious entity, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Ukrainian and Russian relations.

2. **Defensive Posture**: The user states, ""you have to justify them,"" which indicates a confrontational stance. This can be seen as an attempt to challenge the legitimacy of opposing views, which is a common tactic in cultural disputes.

3. **Threat of Administrative Action**: The mention of asking an admin to lock the article if reverts continue introduces a coercive element to the discussion. This can be perceived as an attempt to control the narrative surrounding cultural heritage, particularly in a context where religious affiliations are tied to national identity.

4. **References to Wikipedia Policies**: The invocation of Wikipedia policies like [[WP:NOR]] (No Original Research) and [[WP:NPOV]] (Neutral Point of View) suggests an effort to frame the argument within the context of established guidelines, which can be a tactic to legitimize one's position while delegitimizing others.

The term ""Disputed"" is often used in contexts that suggest contention or conflict, while ""KYIV"" and ""UOC"" serve to reinforce a narrative of legitimacy and ownership from a Ukrainian perspective.

**Explanation:**
The revision primarily focuses on clarifying the discussion around the Orthodox Church in Ukraine and the interpretation of survey data regarding church affiliation. The language used in the ""Diff"" does not exhibit any overtly weaponized terms or narratives that could be used to justify actions or frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light. 

Key indicators include:
- The user, ""Irpen,"" emphasizes the need for clarity and conciseness in the discussion, suggesting that lengthy quotes can obscure the editor's own thoughts. This reflects a concern for maintaining a neutral and informative tone rather than promoting a specific ideological stance.
- The comments about survey reliability and the suggestion to categorize information in a way that acknowledges the complexity of church affiliations indicate an effort to present a balanced view rather than a biased narrative.
- There are no references to the conflict or cultural oppression that would typically signal weaponization of cultural heritage. Instead, the focus is on the academic discussion of survey results and church demographics.

The revision introduces a specific narrative regarding the Uniate Church in Transcarpathia, highlighting a division from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and mentioning protests from church members. The phrase ""despite the protests of a portion of the Church members"" suggests a conflict that could be interpreted as a struggle for cultural and religious identity, which is a sensitive topic in the context of Ukraine's historical and ongoing tensions with Russia.

Additionally, the statement ""there are little followers to Uniate Catholicism in Transcarpathia as it is making the influence of both Uniate churches negligible"" implies a diminishing presence of a particular cultural and religious group, which can be framed in a way that supports narratives of cultural oppression or marginalization. This aligns with the broader themes of cultural heritage weaponization, where the status and influence of religious or cultural groups are used to justify political or territorial claims.
