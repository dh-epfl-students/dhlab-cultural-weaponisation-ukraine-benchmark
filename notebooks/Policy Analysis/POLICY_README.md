# Policy Analysis

This notebook presents code to analyse the wikipedia policy of some articles. We can measure the policy regarding different topics :

* WP content’s assignment: Assess the quality of an article. The system is based on a letter scheme that reflects principally how factually complete the article is, though language quality and layout are also factors.

* WikiProject Importance Scale: The importance rating is part of the WikiProject assessment system.It is assigned per WikiProject, not globally. It tries to answer: "How likely is it that a typical Wikipedia reader will need this article?"

* Vital Article: There are 7,085,890 articles on the English Wikipedia, and 60,000 (around 0.7%) have been selected as vital articles to the project. They are organized into five levels: Level 1 contains 10 articles. Wikiepdia most vitals one. Level 2 is 100, level 2 has 1000, level 4 has 10 000 and 5 has 50 000.
Give direction to the prioritization of improvements of English Wikipedia articles (e.g. which articles to bring to WP:GA and WP:FAstatus)
Provide a measurement of quality of overall English Wikipedia (e.g. what proportion of the most important articles are at GA and FA status)
To serve as a centralized watchlist of English Wikipedia's most important articles.

* Page protection: In some circumstances, pages may need to be protected from modification by certain groups of editors. Pages are protected when there is disruption that cannot be prevented through other means, such as blocks. Protection is a technical restriction applied only by administrators, although any user may request protection. Protection can be indefinite or expire after a specified time.

* Contentious topics: Some WP pages are assigned CT by the Arbitration Committee after users submit a CT request. Only extended-confirmed editors may make edits related to the topic area, though editors who are not extended-confirmed may post constructive comments and make edit requests related to articles within the topic area on article talk pages.
