    "# LLM Weaponisation Detection for Control Group\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses openai API key to detect if an edit from our control group is weaponising or not. The prompt given to ChatGPT is the folllowing :\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are an expert linguistic analysis assistant specializing in detecting subtle shifts in language that might be used to weaponize cultural heritage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is a JSON record representing a Wikipedia article revision. The record follows one of these structures:\n",
    "1. For the original article version (version \"first_version\"):\n",
    "   {{\n",
    "     \"version\": \"first_version\",\n",
    "     \"Content\": \"<full article text>\"\n",
    "   }}\n",

    "     \"Diff\": \"<textual diff showing changes>\"\n",
    "   }}\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "- If the record is a revision (version \"diff\"), focus on the \"Diff\" field and the context provided by \"Comment\" and \"User\".\n",
    "- For an original version (version \"first_version\"), treat it as baseline text.\n",
    "- Analyze the text for subtle shifts in tone, style, or content that may be used to weaponize cultural heritage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are examples of weaponisation terms and narratives:\n",
    "• Term (Ukraine’s Perspective):\n",
    "  - \"Russian occupation of Crimea\"\n",
    "  - \"Russian destruction of cultural sites\"\n",
    "  - \"War crimes in Mariupol\"\n",
    "  - \"Ukrainian neo-Nazi threats to Russian heritage\"\n",
    "  - \"Ukrainian language suppression in occupied territories\"\n",
    "• Term (Russia’s Perspective):\n",
    "  - \"Crimea’s reunification with Russia\"\n",
    "  - \"Legitimacy of annexation\"\n",
    "  - \"Ukrainian territory\"\n",
    "  - \"New Russian regions\"\n",
    "  - \"Who controls Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson?\"\n",
    "  - \"Protection of Russian speakers\"\n",
    "  - \"Narrative of cultural oppression\"\n",
    "Implication or consequence: These terms may be used to justify actions, shift narratives, or frame cultural or territorial control in a specific light.\n",
