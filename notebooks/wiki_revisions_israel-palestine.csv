The argument that a four-paragraph, 600-word lead for a 16,000-word article about such a prominent politician is unfettered nonsense, and the tag placer's repeated concern over settlement support not being mentioned has been properly addressed. The talk page has yielded nothing but a week-long back-and-forth between two (2) editors, and the current lead excellently summarizes Netenyahu for the average reader. At this point, it's just filibustering the tag's removal."
