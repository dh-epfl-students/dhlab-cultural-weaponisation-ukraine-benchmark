    "# Analysis of Weaponised Wikipedia Edits\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Import and Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "From the **LLM Results** folder, I retrieved every `.csv` file and stored them in a list called `dfs`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I also created a dictionary `dfs_named` that maps each article name to its corresponding CSV table containing all edits for that article:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dfs_named[\"2004_Ukrainian_presidential_election_analysis\"]\n",
    "dfs_named[\"Abortion_in_Ukraine_analysis\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "* `dfs` contains 120 CSV tables, giving 117,517 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Filtering for Weaponised Edits\n",
    "\n",
    "From these 117,517 rows, I only kept the ones classified as Weaponised by the LLM:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dfs_weaponised = [df[df['weaponised'] == 'Weaponised'] for df in dfs]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces the dataset to **18,707 rows**, i.e., 18,707 edits potentially considered weaponised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each DataFrame in `dfs_weaponised` contains exactly 7 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* initial_version – text before the edit\n",
    "* changed_version – text after the edit\n",
    "* comment – user’s comment explaining the edit\n",
    "* user – username of the editor\n",
    "* date – timestamp of the edit (ISO format)\n",
    "* llm_output – LLM evaluation of the edit\n",
    "* weaponised – classification: `\"Weaponised\"` (because `\"Not weaponised\"` has already been filtered out).\n",
    "\n",
    "I also created another dictionary, `dfs_weaponised_named`, to keep track of article names alongside their corresponding filtered DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mapping External Chunks to Wikipedia Edits\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to check whether externally provided text chunks appear in the weaponised edits.\n",
    "To do this, I implemented a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def generate_ngrams(text, n=4):\n",
    "    words = text.split()\n",
    "    return [\" \".join(words[i:i+n]) for i in range(len(words)-n+1)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function slices a text into overlapping sequences of n consecutive words (n-grams).\n",
    "I then looped over all weaponised DataFrames and checked if any n-gram was present in the **changed_version** column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following chunk:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\"A referendum in the largely ethnic Russian Ukrainian autonomous region of Crimea resulted in the bloodless annexation of Crimea by Russia on 18 March 2014.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Its 4-word n-grams include:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'A referendum in the',\n",
    " 'the largely ethnic Russian',\n",
    " 'Russian Ukrainian autonomous region',\n",
    " 'region of Crimea resulted',\n",
    " 'resulted in the bloodless',\n",
    " 'bloodless annexation of Crimea',\n",
    " 'Crimea by Russia on',\n",
    " 'on 18 March 2014.']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching with the slice \"bloodless annexation of Crimea\", the following matches were found:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Match found in article 'History_of_Ukraine_analysis', rows [384, 389]\n",
    "Match found in article 'History_of_Ukraine#Early_modern_period_analysis', rows [391, 394]\n",
    "Match found in article 'History_of_Ukraine#World_War_II_and_the_Nazi_Occupation_analysis', rows [381, 390]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Manual Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "I manually checked one example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dfs_weaponised_named[\"History_of_Ukraine#Early_modern_period_analysis\"].loc[391, \"changed_version\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output confirmed that the **changed_version** at that row contained the phrase *\"bloodless annexation of Crimea\"*."
