    "\n",
    "* **Nodes** represent individual users (editors).\n",
    "* **Edges** connect pairs of users who have edited at least one common article.\n",
    "* **Edge weights** correspond to the number of distinct articles co-edited, capturing the intensity of shared editing activity\n",
    "(a normalized alternative based on Jaccard similarity can be introduced at a later stage).\n",
    "* **Node attributes** include editor metadata such as user type, total number of edits, and average weaponising ratio.\n",

    "Community detection is performed using the **Leiden algorithm**, and the resulting clusters are visualized with the **Distributed Recursive Layout (DRL)**, which is well suited for large graphs.\n",

    "The detected clusters correspond to communities of editors with overlapping article portfolios, highlighting patterns of shared editorial focus and potential coordination."
