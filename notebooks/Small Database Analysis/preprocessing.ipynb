    "# Preprocessing of the Small Database (6,922 edits)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the **preprocessing pipeline and methodological choices** used to clean and normalise the raw dataset obtained from the edit–article matching process.  \n",
    "The objective of this step is to transform heterogeneous, noisy Wikipedia data into a **consistent and analytically reliable dataset**, suitable for downstream exploration, statistical analysis, and modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing relies on a single, reusable function applied uniformly to the entire dataset, ensuring **reproducibility and transparency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing Function Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The function below defines the complete cleaning and normalisation pipeline applied to the raw dataframe:\n",
    "\n",
    "- temporal harmonisation,\n",
    "- article name standardisation,\n",
    "- weaponisation label normalisation,\n",
    "- user-type inference,\n",
    "- and column selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Temporal Normalisation and Deduplication\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `year` column is created from the edit timestamp to enable **yearly distribution analyses**.\n",
    "- Duplicate edits are removed based on the `(article, date)` pair to avoid double counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures temporal coherence and prevents artefacts due to duplicated records.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Article Title Cleaning and Normalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Technical suffixes (e.g. `_analysis`) are removed.\n",
    "- Underscores are replaced by spaces to match Wikipedia’s canonical naming conventions.\n",
    "- Known article title changes are manually harmonised to ensure consistency across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is essential to avoid **artificial article fragmentation** in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Weaponisation Label Harmonisation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `weaponised` field is normalised by:\n",
    "  - lowercasing,\n",
    "  - trimming whitespace,\n",
    "  - and mapping heterogeneous labels to a controlled vocabulary:\n",
    "    - `Weaponised`\n",
    "    - `Not Weaponised`\n",
    "    - `Unknown`\n",
    "- Entries labelled as `Unknown` are excluded from further analysis to preserve interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guarantees **semantic consistency** across analyses involving weaponisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. User Type Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "User types are inferred directly from the `user` field using heuristic rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anonymous (IP)**  \n",
    "  Detected via IPv4 / IPv6 regular expression matching.\n",
    "- **Bot**  \n",
    "  Detected via case-insensitive matching of the string `\"bot\"` in the username.\n",
    "- **Registered**  \n",
    "  Default category when neither anonymous nor bot conditions apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "This classification allows systematic comparison of **editorial behaviour across user categories**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Column Pruning and Dataset Simplification\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intermediate columns used for inference (`is_anon`, `is_bot`) are removed.\n",
    "- Non-essential or redundant columns inherited from the raw extraction are dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting dataframe retains only variables relevant to:\n",
    "- editorial behaviour,\n",
    "- user categorisation,\n",
    "- temporal analysis,\n",
    "- and weaponisation status.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the preprocessing function is a **cleaned, standardised dataframe** that:\n",
    "- is free of duplicates,\n",
    "- uses consistent article and label naming,\n",
    "- contains an explicit `user_type` variable,\n",
    "- and is ready for exploratory analysis and modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessing step lays the foundation for all subsequent analyses.  \n",
    "By enforcing strict data hygiene and explicit methodological choices, it ensures that any detected patterns — including **signals of weaponisation or coordinated behaviour** — are attributable to genuine editorial dynamics rather than artefacts of data collection or formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting dataset is designed to support feature extraction for the development of a downstream **Large Language Model (LLM)** focused on identifying and contextualising manipulative or strategic editing behaviours on Wikipedia."
