The main attractions of the Lavra include the [[Great Lavra Belltower]], and the [[Cathedral of the Dormition (Pechersk Lavra)|Dormition Cathedral]], destroyed in fighting the Germans [[World War II]], and fully reconstructed in the 1990s after the fall of Soviet Union by Ukraine.\n\nOther churches and cathedrals of the Lavra include: the [[Refectory Church (Pechersk Lavra)|Refectory Church]], the Church of All Saints, the [[Church of the Saviour at Berestove]], the Church of the Exaltation of Cross, the Church of the Trinity, the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin, the Church of the Conception of St. Anne, and the Church of the Life-Giving Spring.

The temple was finally restored in 1995 after Ukraine obtained its independence and the construction was accomplished in two years. The new Dormition Church was consecrated in 2000.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Gate Church of the Trinity===\n{{main|Gate Church of the Trinity, Kyiv Pechersk Lavra}}\n\nThe Gate Church of the Trinity is located atop the Holy Gates, which houses the entrance to the monastery. According to a legend, this church was founded by the [[Chernihiv]] [[Rulers of Kievan Rus'|Prince]] [[Sviatoslav II of Kiev|Sviatoslav II]]. It was built atop an [[Architecture of Kievan Rus'|ancient stone church]] which used to stand in its place.\nAfter the fire of 1718, the church was rebuilt, its revered facades and interior walls enriched with ornate stucco work made by craftsman V. Stefaovych.\nIn the 18th century, a new gilded pear-shaped dome was built, the facade and exterior walls were decorated with stucco-moulded plant ornaments and a vestibule built of stone attached to the north end. In the early 20th century, the fronts and the walls flanking the entrance were painted by icon painters under the guidance of V. Sonin. The interior of the Gate Trinity Church contains murals by the early 18th century painter Alimpy Galik.{{cn|date=January 2023}}\n\n===Refectory chambers with Church of the Saints Anthony and Theodosius===\n{{main|Refectory Church, Kyiv Pechersk Lavra}}\n[[File:Kijów zabytkowy (307).JPG|thumb|Refectory Church]]\nThe refectory chambers with the Church of the Saints Anthony and Theodosius is the third in a series of temples. The original temple was built in the 12th century and no drawings or visual depictions of it remain. The second temple was built at the time of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] and was disassembled by the Russian authorities in the 19th century. It was replaced with the current temple, often referred to as the Refectory Church of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra.{{cn|date=January 2023}}\n\n===The All Saints Church===\nThe All Saints Church, erected in 1696–1698, is a fine specimen of Ukrainian baroque architecture. Characteristic of the church facades are rich architectural embellishments. In 1905, students of the Lavra art school painted the interior walls of the church. The carved wooden iconostasis is multi-tiered and was made for the All Saints church in the early 18th century.{{cn|date=January 2023}}\n\n===Church of the Saviour at Berestove===\n{{main|Church of the Saviour at Berestove}}\n[[File:Церква Спаса-на-Берестові, м.

It was constructed in the village of Berestove around the start of the 11th century during the reign of Prince [[Vladimir II Monomakh|Vladimir Monomakh]]. It later served as the mausoleum of the Monomakh dynasty, also including [[Yuri Dolgoruki]], the founder of Moscow. Despite being outside the Lavra fortifications, the Church of the Saviour at Berestove is part of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra complex.{{cn|date=January 2023}}\n{{clearleft}}\n\n===Caves===\n{{main|Near Caves}}\n\nThe Kyiv Pechersk Lavra caverns are a system of narrow underground corridors (about 1-1½ metres wide and 2-2½ metres high), along with numerous living quarters and underground chapels. In 1051, the monk [[Anthony of Kiev|Anthony]] settled in an old cave in a hill near the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. This cave received additions including corridors and a church, and is now the [[Far Caves]]. In 1057, Anthony moved to a cave near the Upper Lavra, now called the [[Near Caves]].{{cn|date=January 2023}}\n\nForeign travellers in the 16th–17th centuries wrote that the catacombs of the Lavra stretched for hundreds of kilometres, reaching as far as Moscow and [[Velikiy Novgorod|Novgorod]],<ref name=\"Touring Kyiv\">{{cite book | first=Ruta | last=Malikenaite | year=2003 | title=Guidebook: Touring Kyiv | publisher=Baltia Druk | location=Kyiv | isbn=966-96041-3-3}}</ref> spreading awareness of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra.{{cn|date=January 2023}}\n\n===Library===\nThe notable library of the Lavra was burned during the reign of [[Peter the Great]]. On the night of April 21-22, 1718, Orthodox monks — tsarist agents — set fire to the premises of the Lavra, where its library and archive with unique documents and books from the historical past of Ukraine were located.\n\nIn 1988, after the restoration of the monastery's activities, library work was resumed. The funds began to be replenished with those publications that the Lavra monks and parishioners managed to save. New books began to be purchased, and some of the books that began to be published by the Lavra printing house restored in 1995 were transferred to the library.\n\nOver 20 years of activity after the revival of the monastery, more than 10 thousand volumes were collected. In 2008, the library was moved to premises that allow the best placement and organization of library funds.
