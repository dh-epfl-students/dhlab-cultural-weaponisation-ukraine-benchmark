It warrants a mention and discussion on the naming in the text of a [[Kiev]] article as well as a mention in parentheses in some other articles. It's very limited usage in the major English media shows that it should not be used as a main name for the city in encyclopedia. That's my view on the issue.\n \n :: Therefore, while I never go to editing the article just to replace Kyiv by Kiev, I do that when I edit the page for other reasons. This page, for instance, was in a dire need of an expansion template and links were placed at the wrong place. This prompted my interference, not the usage of Kyiv itself. I would have never been persistent, if I haven't viewed Kyiv as a wrong usage in an encyclopedia article. I supported changing terms to Ukrainian names in many cases. Thanks for your complements :). I will not revert Kyiv in this article now but only for the sake of the world peace.

[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 20:25, Apr 16, 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-: Irpen, you're unfairly glossing over the issue.  The titling of the article on \"[[Kiev]]\" has been discussed and resolved, because the Russian transliteration is the most commonly used name in English.   \n-\n-: But regarding the use of the city's native Ukrainian name ''Kyiv'' in writing there is no consensus, no Wikipedia policy nor convention, and very little actual discussion.  ''Kyiv'' is used in several English-language publications and press establishments.  It is an alternate name in English, the authors of this article have deemed it acceptable in its context, and no random readers have changed it or complained.  It can be just as legitimately used as the name in Russian \"Kharkov\" is for [[Kharkiv]], in articles about WWII battles in the Ukrainian SSR.\n-\n-::I agree there is no consensus. There was similarly no \"consensus\" for the titling of the [[Kiev]] article. Just the reasoning for Kiev appeared strong enough even for those who disagreed. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]]\n-\n-: You've stated elsewhere that ''\"I see the usage of Kyiv by many authors as a completely legitimate attempt to change the established name of the city\"''.  I'm tempted to see your systematic censorship as an attempt to protect the status quo.  I respect you for your contributions and your infinitely patient discussions, but you seem to be just as attached to the question of Kyiv vs. Kiev as I am.  \n-\n-::  I did not mean the editors of WP are among the authors whose use of Kyiv I find acceptable. It is OK to use Kyiv, say, as a journalist, if this does not contradict the style policy of the newspaper or a magazine. It is also OK to use Kyiv for the book authors if they see fit. These two cases are examples of acceptable promoting the usage of Kyiv. It is not OK to use Kyiv (at least yet) in encyclopedia, which, as a ''reference'' source, should reflect the established usage rather than be used to push one term over another. I am trying to make sure that WP reflects the current usage as it should. If you consider this as \"protecting the status quo\" I won't argue about that. Encyclopedia is a wrong medium to push one term, preferable to some, against the other. There are other media, including many on the web, appropriate for this. Whatever usage currently prevails, it is the one encyclopedia should use. When KharkIv seemed to have been established and beat KharkOv in modern English usage, it became an appropriate term for the WP and I voted for it. KharkOv is still established in some fields, therefore it is appropriate to use in certain topics. KYIV is not established in any context since Kiev was used in English for as long as there are any records. Currently, because of the partial success of promoters KYIV, it became somewhat used. It warrants a mention and discussion on the naming in the text of a [[Kiev]] article as well as a mention in parentheses in some other articles. It's very limited usage in the major English media shows that it should not be used as a main name for the city in encyclopedia. That's my view on the issue.\n-\n-:: Therefore, while I never go to editing the article just to replace Kyiv by Kiev, I do that when I edit the page for other reasons. This page, for instance, was in a dire need of an expansion template and links were placed at the wrong place. This prompted my interference, not the usage of Kyiv itself. I would have never been persistent, if I haven't viewed Kyiv as a wrong usage in an encyclopedia article. I supported changing terms to Ukrainian names in many cases. Thanks for your complements :). I will not revert Kyiv in this article now but only for the sake of the world peace. I might do it later if I research the subject of the hisory of Ukrainian christianity enough to contribute to this article. I am open, though, to opinions on the issue at this and other talk pages. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]]\n-\n-: I am choosing to combat systemic bias, and restoring the use of ''Kyiv'' in this article.  ''&mdash;[[User:Mzajac |Michael]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mzajac |Z.]]&nbsp;<small>2005-04-16&nbsp;22:04&nbsp;Z</small>''\n-\n-:: I think it is incorrect to call my position a systemic bias. I do view the usage of Kyiv in encyclopedia as premature and act accordingly. However, it is easy to see that I endorsed and used other Ukrainian names in many articles. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 16:43, Apr 17, 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-::: No offense meant.  By ''systemic bias'' I just meant the inertia of a mainstream convention.  It's not necessarily a wrong bias, and 'combating' it certainly is by definition \"experimental\", but Wikipedia does have some commitment to that end (i.e., [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias]]). \n-:::: No offence taken :). I can't argue that widely accepted conventions may create the bias toward the mainstream opinion. Means of addressing this problem is a different issue. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]]\n-\n-::: I apologize for accusing you of \"systematic censorship\"; that was definitely out of line.  You certainly are one of the most objective editors regarding such matters.  ''&mdash;[[User:Mzajac |Michael]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mzajac |Z.]]&nbsp;<small>2005-04-18&nbsp;20:54&nbsp;Z</small>''\n-:::: I didn't take it as any offence at all. I agree that the editors should exercise a reasonable self-restraint in changing the names even when they feel there are good reasons for doing so. My self-imposed restraint in the cases like this is not to push the \"edit\" button for the sole purpose of changing the name of a person or a place. However, I do change names (in good faith) in the course of other edits in the article. Unlike Kharkiv/Kharkov, I just don't feel that there exists a context that might affect the choice between Kyiv/Kiev as a primary name since Kiev seems to have always been and still seems to be a primary usage in English. Of course which term is correct may be a subject of debate. But whatever the correct term is, it should be used in WP for the sake of consistency. [[User:Irpen|Irpen]]\n-\n-==Suggestion to move the article from the ''\"Ukrainian Orthodox Church\"'' to ''\"Orthodox Christianity in Ukraine\"''==\n-Such title would seem more appropriate since two churches currently claim the jurisdiction and the name and the article is broader than simply being about these two churches. This is the article about the history of Ukrainian Christianity which in any case won't be a history of any of these churches, both created very recently. If after some years, the situation settles down and there will be a single canonical universally recognized church body in UA under the UOC name, we could change the name back.

There would have to be a bit more representation of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] (inclusion of which may be controversial), but not much because that one has a larger article of its own.  ''&mdash;[[User:Mzajac |Michael]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mzajac |Z.]]&nbsp;<small>2005-04-18&nbsp;20:38&nbsp;Z</small>''\n-\n-: Come to think of it, there's some historical material at UGCC which might be merged into this article.

Я просматривал эту страницу несколько месяцев назад, она была более или менее нейтральна, однако только вчера обратил внимание, что туда была добавлена [[User:Kuban kazak]] ом довольно противоречивая секция. Я ее заменил текстом, описывающим теже события, как я полагаю, с нейтральной точки зрения. Если есть какие-либо сомнения в этом - можно обсудить. Но полагаю, этот текст можно оставить как основу для дальнейших редактирований.  [[User:Kuban kazak]]  вносит довольно много правок в статьи об истории Украины, и в частности, христианства, но у большинства из них имеется весьма существенный недостаток, что они либо опираются на жизненный опыт (ощущения, переживания), либо не подкреплены источниками, либо источники крайне ненадежны. Часто это сайты различных православных организаций, братств довольно экстремистского толка. Безусловно, довольно сложно ожидать нейтральности от сайтов, публикующих [http://www.krotov.info/acts/20/1900/1906anti.html Программу Союза Русского Народа] (Черной Сотни) рядом с [http://www.krotov.info/history/20/1997petr.html главным источником] [[User:Kuban kazak]]а . С этой крайне тенденциозной книги им перенесено уже много непроверенных фактов, жаргонных терминов и антиукраинского POV на страницы википедии, в частности в статью  [[Pochaev Lavra]]. Я не возражаю против редактирований [[User:Kuban kazak]]а, если они будут подкреплены '''надежными и нейтральными''' источниками, а не только \"Православной энциклопедией\". В противном случае, если не будет достигнуто согласие и понимание, я полагаю следует рассмотреть эти редактирования на RfCom, потому как конфликты из-за использования таких источников возникают у  [[User:Kuban kazak]]а с завидной регулярностью и формальных поводов более чем достаточно.  Удивительно, что на русской википедии подобный POV довольно активно пресекается вики-сообществом, а на английской нет, хотя, как мне кажется, людей разделяющих подобные крайние взгляды среди \"русского сообщества\" на англопедии очень немного. --[[User:Yakudza|Yakudza]] 00:10, 9 March 2006 (UTC)\n \n ::Your version was copypasted from here [http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/orthodox.kp/filaret/], that is plagiarism and will be removed.--[[User:Kuban kazak|Kuban Cossack]] 00:13, 9 March 2006 (UTC)\n+::::This not problem possible to rephrase or arrange as quoting.

At the same time this correct figure may be somehwat misleading when considering religious afficiliation, because the western parts of the country are more church-going than the eastern parts, so that among the general population the UOC is by far the largest Church, while among very devout people (those going to church every week) this may not be the case (see the stats in the \"protestantism in Ukraine\" section above).  I think that Protestants should be included in any figures.  Particularly in Transcarpathia, where they are quite common and have old historic roots (about 75% of the Hungarians, making up 12% of the population there, are Protestants).  Regards [[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 13:15, 12 June 2006 (UTC)\n \n+:Agree and disagree. The problem is that for Hungarians Protestantism is their \"mother-religion\" whilst elsewhere in Ukraine this is mostly a result of missionary work. So how do we apply this is a good question.

From the beginning, the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitans]] of Kiev resided at [[Pereyaslav]] in [[Ukraine]], then Kiev([[1037]]). The identity and further separate development of the Kievan Church was achieved by the election of Metropolitans, native and/or not confirmed by the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] (Ilarion, [[1051]]-[[1054]]; Klym Smolyatich [[1147]]-[[1154]]; and, Gregory Tsamblak [[1415]]-[[1419]]). \n+\n+Following the [[Mongol invasion of Russia|Mongol annihilation]] of Kiev in the 13th century, the [[Metropolitan of Kiev]] moved to [[Vladimir]] in [[1299]]. By [[1326]], the Metropolitan had settled in [[Moscow]], and by [[1328]] had changed the title of Metropolitan of Kiev for the title [[Metropolitan of Moscow]]. The separate legal tradition of the Russian Church, as differentiated from the Church in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], was codified in the decision of the first properly Russian Church [[Council of the Hundred Chapters]] ('Stoglav') in [[1448]], followed by the formal separation of the Church of Rus' into separate Russian (Muscovite) and [[Ruthenia]]n (Kievan) Metropoliae in [[1453]].\n+\n+=== Middle Ruthenian period ===\n+Meanwhile, for the Church of Kiev, the loss of the Metropolitan of Kiev in [[1299]] was rapidly supplanted by the creation of the Metropolia of [[Halych]] for Southern Rus' in [[1303]].  In [[1352]], the [[Metropolitan of Halych]] began to relocate back to Kiev; thereafter, the Kievan Church was headed by the [[Metropolitan of Kiev-Halych and All Rus]].  The [[Metropolitan of Moscow]] opposed the creation of this Metropolia at Halych/Kiev. This Church governed most of the lands of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], often from the city of [[Navahrudak]] in today's Belarus.  Between [[1054]] and [[1448]], this Ruthenian Church continued to send representatives to the ecumenical councils called by the Pope of Rome {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, but also succumbed to increasing pressure by her mother church among Greek in Constantinople to cease communion with the Bishop ([[Pope]]) of Rome. Though Constantinople and Rome had their disputes, the Kievan hierarchy tried to work for Christian unity{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Representatives from Rus participated in the Western Councils of Lyon (1245) and Constance (1418). Isidore, the Metropolitan of Kiev, was himself one of the creators of the Union of Florence (1439).\n+\n+=== The era of Catholic-Orthodox rivalry and separation ===\n+The memory of the [[Council of Florence]] on the Ruthenian lands of Ukraine and Belarus, which had passed under the control of the states of [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]] after the decline of the Ukrainian-centered empire of [[Rus]]', bore concrete fruit in the [[Union of Brest]] (Berest') in [[1596]], which united the Ruthenian Church of the Ukrainian and Belarusyn lands of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] with the Pope of Rome. This union was not accepted by all the members of the Greek Church in these lands, and marked the beginning of the creation of separate Ukrainian Catholic and [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church|Ukrainian Orthodox]] Churches on the lands of [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]]. Due to violence, the Metropolitan of the Kievan Greek Catholic Church left Kiev early in the [[1600s]] and settled in Navahrudak and [[Wilno]] in Belarus.\n+\n+----\n+For Now...

Surveys are generally recognized as legitimate ways of viewing public opinion, provided that they are conducted by professionals working for respected organization.

There is no legitimate reason to exclude the data from their survey.  \n+\n+As for number of parishes - this is not a completely accurate indicator, because it may reflect better financing and doesn't take into account the size of parishes.  For example, the number of (western-financed) Protestant parishes seems to overrepresent the number of actual Protestant believers.  The best approach is to use parish size plus survey data (and hopefully irpen will find other surveys) to provice the most objective picture possible.\n+\n+Furthermore, it seems silly to wipe out estimates on topics such as US government estimates simply because of the fact that the US government got WMDs wrong (this is another and complicated matter - the public excuses for the Iraq war didn't match what analysts were saying).

Snyder's \"Reconstruction of Nations\" ISBN 0-300-10586-X). However, in the modern times, the religion's role in the Ukrainian self-identity is not as significant. A significant portion of Ukrainians is non-religious and many have been attracted by the proseletysm of different Western Churches whose activity in the country is very significant in the last 20 years.

This particular case, however, has a caveat that KK has correctly pointed out. Most lay people have little interest in the church politics and, while it is hard to come up with estimates, a significant group of Ukrainians do not know much about Orthodox divisions within Ukraine. For many religious self-identification does not go beyond being able to self-identify as Orthodox, Greek-Catholic or a Jehova's witness. To know the details of UOC's rivarly one either needs to follow the issue in the news or be personally involved in the interchurch fights (like witnessing one's own church being commandeered by the paramilitary assistants of either faction or even take part in those series of captures). Certainly if one can self-identify with the national church and state that it is under a patriarch abroad (UOC(MP)), one is more likely to know exactly what one is saying.

Urban society, at most is brought up on Marxist, cosmopolitan ideals...where the majority of people are not regular church-goers. In fact it is something of similar to Soviet times, if before people were members of Comsomol and even the party, that did not mean that they actually were idiologically communist. What changed? It got a new name although retained the same abbreviation - КП, was founded by ex-Communists Kravchuk and Dinisenko, and if yesterday it talked about the bad influences of Trotskism, Maoism and Capitalism, today its any Russophilism/Moscowphilism. The only difference is that it is no longer compulsary to attend <s>meetings</s> services. The majority don't because they could not care less. \n :With respect to the rural population, then for its majority, the people are traditional and conservative. It is hardly a wonder why the UOC(MP) statistically in all, minus the western regions, has absoloute majority in rural Ukraine. Most of the rural settlements are one church per selo. Moreover most of the construction of new churches takes place in rural areas. [http://orthodox.org.ua/uk/node/197]. Now wether or not the people of those rural settlements resent the fact that they are UOC(MP) church-goers is irrelevant, and until a full census is published - Original Research.

In the New York Times and Times of London, the accepted style is \"Kiev\", not Kyiv when writing about the city, but to preserve \"Kyiv\" in the proper names of organizations who select that spelling, hence \"Dynamo Kyiv\". [[User:Qe2|Qe2]] 05:16, 12 February 2007 (UTC)\n \n A much more pertinent question for the purposes of this article, is the practice of translating the names of Ukrainian saints into non-Ukrainian variants.

That is the point, because you and I know that the distribution and popularity of a particular church is very dependent on the geographical location. Thus it is very easy to say that in Lviv most will choose UGCC, in Sevastopol - UOC(MP) and so on... This is just simple common sense (which quoted as a reason below). Now then we look at parish data, and what do you know, in Crimea UOC-KP has 2% and in Lviv UOC(MP) - 2%. Which matches the common sense. The only place that surveys can be reliable is in a 50:50 atmosphere like Kiev. Look combine the UOC(MP) with those of no particular choice, and then divide by UOC-KP and you obtain the same ratio as you would by dividing the no of UOC(MP)'s parishes by those of UOC-KP. Now continuing by using common sense, I can draw the conclusion that the people who said they have no preference adhere to the UOC(MP). Hence in any survey to gain the portion of Ukrainians adhering to the UOC(MP) we simply combine those that deliberatly specify MP and those that do not.

Now then we look at parish data, and what do you know, in Crimea UOC-KP has 2% and in Lviv UOC(MP) - 2%. Which matches the common sense. The only place that surveys can be reliable is in a 50:50 atmosphere like Kiev. Look combine the UOC(MP) with those of no particular choice, and then divide by UOC-KP and you obtain the same ratio as you would by dividing the no of UOC(MP)'s parishes by those of UOC-KP.

For the record I doubt that God himself has any particular nationality or ethnicity. Thus it is on the contrary important to state, that back in Byzantine empire the five patriarchates were formed for administration only, not to endorse local nationalism...On the contrary I support simultaneously church unity and local autonomy i.e. on the level of liturgy language and local saints - but at the same time all of those saints will be recognised by any other church in communion. As a result you have Bulgarian Orthodox Churches in honour of Alexander Nevsky (as an example). UOC-KP on the other hand upon seizing a building would rename it to its own taste. Like what happened with the Church of [[Our Lady of Kazan]] was renamed in honour of some other icon. Speaking of seizures, I myself witnessed one in [[Rivne]]. With all said above, it is, but a personal opinion and irrelevant to the article, however I want you to understand, that just because you are involved with the religion, does not mean that everything you put is right, or '''is politically correct in the way it is presented'''. As for data, then again if someone feels its sketchy, that someone cannot be blamed for being cynical. On the contrary it only increases the authority of the article each time someone brings in a source that is less biased and more authentic. For example simple church statistics are more credible than third party sources and historical books.\n+::::With all said above, in the end there should be a good result from all this one that will not only suit both of our tastes, but one that we can mutually agree on.

Questions of who conducted the survey, how obvious are their results, whether they are self-contradictory or not are important. \n+\n+[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;2964/ Here] is another related survey published on the very same web-site, RISU, and even taken by the same institution, the Ukrainian Sociology Service. Let's take a look at these numbers:\n+\n+:''\"According to the survey, among the 70 percent of Ukrainians who consider themselves religious, 40 percent belong to particular religions and denominations and 29 percent have not decided on their religion. About 16 percent of people stated they are not religious and another 14 percent remain undecided.\"''\n+\n+So, 70% of population of Ukraine consider are religious, 16% are non-religious and 14% are \"unsure\". From those who claim being religious, just over a half consider themselves being part of a specific denomination, and the rest simply think that they \"have faith in Gov\" (40% vs 29%)\n+\n+Reading further:\n+\n+:''\"In addition, the survey revealed that the three biggest denominations in Ukraine are the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate (UOC-KP) and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC) with 37.8, 28.7 and 18.6 percent of the faithful respectively. The faithful of these churches constitute about 85 percent of Ukrainians who identified themselves as religious.\"''\n+\n+So, we have: \n+:UOC - 37.8%, UOC-KP - 28.7%, UGCC - 18.6%\n+\n+The numbers are rather surprizing compared to the results given in the [http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;13940 survey linked by Faustian] where we read:\n+:UOC - 20.4%, KP - 30.1%, UGCC - 7.8%, UAOC - 1.5%\n+\n+What is substantial is not even that UOC has such a clear advantage over KP, but how significantly the numbers differ from survey to survey published by the same source. Those surveys being taken two years apart cannot explain such a huge difference as 10% switching from UOC to KP and even more startling would be the supposed conversion of millions of Ukrainians from Greek Catholicism to the Eastern Orthodoxy within two years. The conversion between Greek Catholic and Orthodox church is a serious matter and millions do not just switch between different branches of Christianity in the period of two years. \n+\n+Now, there are CIA worldbook numbers which differ from both surveys. A simple common sense tells that CIA simply used some other survey as not just CIA but even the Ukrainian authorities do not conduct the comprehensive censuses about the religious preferences of the Ukrainians. What we really in those surveys are the confused people, most of who do not even attend any church give answers to the questions that not all of them even fully understand as only truly religious  ones are able to give an informed answer to such question. As a result we get an arbitrary set of all confusing numbers that show dramatically different results from survey to survey. In view of this, we should either not use such survey data at all or, if we add it to the article, we should state that surveys produce contradictory results and are an unreliable indicator of anything.\n+\n+As the same time, the numbers of parishes statistics is taken from the numbers filed with the State Committee on the Religious Affairs. The leaders of the parishes cannot not know exactly what denomination they belong. This is reliable and encyclopedic info.\n+\n+As for the surveys, when the question is clear, like \"What language do you use primarily at home?\", the results of such surveys are more valid than when the question is \"Do you support the idea of the Russian language becoming the state language in Ukraine?\", as the latter question understandably is much more confusing. The surveys with the more confusing questions are especially vulnerable to challenges if they produce wildly different results from survey to  survey. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 01:06, 18 February 2007 (UTC)\n+\n ==Protection==\n Between the <br>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Christianity_in_Ukraine&oldid=107188846 Revision of 19:33 on 10 February 2007]] and today's block, only one citation has remained from the material added before the mass revert.

Wilson's Book \"The Ukrainians: Unexpected Nation.\" writes a great deal about what followed after that. On most recent events reputable papers (like Zerkalo Nedeli which has a full archive search) could provide the info.

Безусловно, довольно сложно ожидать нейтральности от сайтов, публикующих [http://www.krotov.info/acts/20/1900/1906anti.html Программу Союза Русского Народа] (Черной Сотни) рядом с [http://www.krotov.info/history/20/1997petr.html главным источником] [[User:Kuban kazak]]а .

This is an encyclopedic article, so it should be correct and informative, and not artificially simplified. [[Muscovy]] has its own article, where the term is thoroughly explained and can (and should) be linked. The problem I see with \"Muscovy\" is that the term is considered politically incorrect or dyslogistic by some of the contemporary Russians. Nevertheless, I don't think it has such negative connotations in English language and should be used where appropriate, as the correct term. Some Russian editors might object, though, because of their different understanding of the word. --[[User:Lysy|Lysy]]<sup>[[User talk:Lysy|talk]]</sup> 06:44, 30 June 2006 (UTC)\n-\n-You make some good points, but I maintain my position (although a phrase like AndriyK's: \"Muscovy, the old name for Russia\" or the \"Russian state of Muscovy\" might be good although it's a bit clumsy).  Wikipedia as I understand it is encyclopedic but it is meant for general readers, educated laypersons, and not professional academics (unless they will be so kind as to provide their knowledge to the rest of us) for whom the journals one finds in universiyty libraries are more important vehicles of information-gathering.\n-\n-I think that parallels can be drawn elsewhere: as I had mentioned, prior to the mid 18th century the word Ukrainians was not widely used for the Ukrainian people.  Does that mean we change all references to Ukrainian cossacks, Ukrainian haidamaks, etc.?  Early Polish history lies well outside my area of competance, but wikipedia suggests that the word for [[Greater Poland]] first appeared in 1257; does that mean that the early Polish kings such as Mieszko or Boleslaw should be referred to as Mazovians, Kujabs or whatever depending on their origins rather thna the less specific but still essentially correct term, \"Poles\"?  Should any Germans prior to the second reich be listed as only as Bavarians, Swabians, Saxons, Prussians, Hessians, etc.?  Was Goethe a Hessian or [[Holy Roman Empire| Holy Roman]] writer rather than a German one?  It would all be unecessarily confusing.

I doubt that Irpen suggested that the surveys were \"100% forgeries\", just that they contained inconsistencies and therefore that they are far from perfect as a source of information.  Every source of info contains advantages and disadvantages.  The number of new church buildings may reflect funding, not number of adherants, for instance.  After all, does the building of the massive UGCC cathedral in Kiev signify that Kievans have turned to Catholicism?  The number of old church buildings might reflect the fact that the UOC (MP) is the heir of the owner of all church buildings in Ukraine prior to the 1990's.  \n+\n+It is best to simply put in all the data - the survey data (both sides), the number of parishes, number of buildings, with brief explanations of what this means.

However, the problem is not researchers' lack of professionalism, but the lack of firm denominational identity among respondents. Actually, this is not a problem for the Eastern Rite Catholic Church because it consistently accounts for six to eight percent of the adult population of Ukraine in surveys. It is more complicated with Protestants because some surveys do not \"catch\" them at all. For example, Jehovah's Witnesses, some Pentecostals, and even some Baptists do not respond to the name Protestant. Yet, Protestant denominations that have a fixed membership are easy to count. The All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christian-Baptist Church has 130,000 members, the All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christians (Pentecostal) has about 90,000 members, the Ukrainian Union of Seventh-day Adventists has about 40,000 members, and Jehovah's Witnesses have about 107,000 members. The above Protestants, plus members of charismatic and independent churches (excluding Reformed and Lutherans), cannot be more than 600,000 to 700,000. Without question, their influence on religious life is much higher than their numbers would suggest. But the figures shown also undermine the idea of \"Protestant expansion\" in Ukraine. \n+\n+\n+How Religious Is Ukraine?\n+Results of Survey Research\n+\n+1. Your attitude to religion.

The All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christian-Baptist Church has 130,000 members, the All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christians (Pentecostal) has about 90,000 members, the Ukrainian Union of Seventh-day Adventists has about 40,000 members, and Jehovah's Witnesses have about 107,000 members. The above Protestants, plus members of charismatic and independent churches (excluding Reformed and Lutherans), cannot be more than 600,000 to 700,000. Without question, their influence on religious life is much higher than their numbers would suggest. But the figures shown also undermine the idea of \"Protestant expansion\" in Ukraine. \n \n \n-How Religious Is Ukraine?\n+:How Religious Is Ukraine?\n Results of Survey Research\n \n 1.

I suggest the article include the parish info, (and describe limitations of it), and add something like \"in contrast to the number of parishes, most surveys state that UOC (KP) has more adherents, although other surveys state the opposite,\" reference the various surveys, and add a statement that the truth is not definitively known.  Also briefly state the limitations of survey data in general and probably mention lower numbers of believers in the UOC (MP) territory in southern and eastern Ukraine as a possible explanation for the discrepency between UOC (MP) greater number of parishes versus UOC (MP) a la Andrew Wilson.  I would also take out the UOC (MP) claim of having 75% of the adherents (unless we put in a statement by the KP - I would prefer neither).  Would that sound fair to you?

However, the problem is not researchers' lack of professionalism, but the lack of firm denominational identity among respondents. Actually, this is not a problem for the Eastern Rite Catholic Church because it consistently accounts for six to eight percent of the adult population of Ukraine in surveys. It is more complicated with Protestants because some surveys do not \"catch\" them at all. For example, Jehovah's Witnesses, some Pentecostals, and even some Baptists do not respond to the name Protestant. Yet, Protestant denominations that have a fixed membership are easy to count. The All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christian-Baptist Church has 130,000 members, the All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christians (Pentecostal) has about 90,000 members, the Ukrainian Union of Seventh-day Adventists has about 40,000 members, and Jehovah's Witnesses have about 107,000 members. The above Protestants, plus members of charismatic and independent churches (excluding Reformed and Lutherans), cannot be more than 600,000 to 700,000. Without question, their influence on religious life is much higher than their numbers would suggest.

For purposes of a less clumsy comparison, I have standardized the numbers by making them all a percentage of the general population rather than percentage of believers (as we have seen, some surveys give results in different formats).  For example, survey one [http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;2964] stated that only 40% of the population belongs to a particular religion and the figures provided are for those 40% rather than for the general population.  To get the general population total, I multiplied each of the numbers by .4.  Anyways, in this discussion we have:\n+\n+:[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;2964/ Survey 1] \n+::UOC - 15.1%, KP - 11.5%, UGCC - 7.44%, religious but no particular religion - 29% \n+\n+:[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;13940 Survey 2] :\n+::UOC - 20.4%, KP - 30.1%, UGCC - 7.8%, UAOC - 1.5%\n+\n+:Viktor Yelens'kii, Oleksandr Stegnii, Andrii Yurash, and Il'ko Kucheriv, \"Kruglii stil' Religiinii vibir naselennia Ukraini: za danimi opituvannia gromads'koi dumki' [Round Table Discussion 'Religious Choices of Ukraine's Population: According to the Data from Public Opinions Polls'].\" Kyiv: Fond \"Demokratichni initsiativi,\" Mott Foundation, 2000.\n+:: UOC (MP) - 12%, KP - 22%, Orthodox, no particular denomination - 26%, UGCC - 8%, UAOO - 1%\n+\n+:Andrew Wilson's description of \"largest and most comprehensive survey undertaken in 1997\" :\n+:: UOC (MP) + ROC - 9.8%, KP - 17.63%, UGCC - 5.9%, UAOC - 1%, religious but no particular religion - 24.6%\n+\n+:Sosis-[[Gallup Poll]] from 1998 : \n+:: UOC (MP) - 7.3%, KP - 20.4%, UGCC - 6.3%, Orthodox but no particular affiliation - 16%\n+\n+: CIA Worldfactbook :\n+:: UOC (MP) - 9%, KP - 19%, UGCC - 6%, UAOC - 1.7%, Orthodox no particular jurisdiction 16%\n+\n+I did not include the data from the US State Department website preceding the page break  because it didn't say what percentage were believers (so I couldn't standardize it).  Feel free to add others.  Five scientific, respected surveys have been listed above, along with data from the Worldfactbook which presumably is also based on a scientific survey.  The conclusions so far:\n+\n+With resepct to adherence to the UGCC and UAOC, the results are '''quite consistant'''.  Across ''all six surveys'', about 6-8% of the Ukrainian population identifes itself as Greek Catholic and 1-2% as belonging to the UAOC.\n+\n+Now, let's look at the two largest Orthodox Churches.\n+\n+Five of the surveys allow the choice \"Orthodox of no particular jurisdiction.\"  Of these, the numbers are remarkably consistant on four of the five surveys, with the UOC (MP) having the adherence of about 7-12% of the population and the KP of 19-22% of the population.  On only one survey the UOC (MP) has the advantage, but even there it is a rather slight one (15.1% versus 11.5% of the general population).  The Orthodox situation is somewhat muddled because in each survey a huge number of Orthodox adherents do not list a particular preference.            \n+\n+I see no reason to question the validity of the surveys based on \"inconsistent results\", as the results are indeed rather consistant across most surveys and any variance is logically explainable. \n+\n+Therefore, the conclusions based on the survey data should stand.  The write-up should summarize the results of all the scientific surveys.  The number of adherents of the UGCC should be described as 6-8% of the general population and of the UAOC as 1-2% of the general population.  The article should describe the limitation of specific numbers for Orthodox due to the large number of people who do not express loyalty to a particular Church.  However, it should note that of those who ''do'' identify specifically, most surveys show greater allegience to the UOC-KP than the UOC (MP).\n+\n+What do you think, Irpen?  regards [[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 16:20, 20 February 2007 (UTC)\n+\n ==Protection==\n Between the <br>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Christianity_in_Ukraine&oldid=107188846 Revision of 19:33 on 10 February 2007]] and today's block, only one citation has remained from the material added before the mass revert.

I wrong in stating that ''the evidence suggests'' that the UOC (MP) and KP are evenly matched.  Rather, this was my educated guess based upon the presumption that most of the ones of no particular denomination are from southern and eastern Ukraine (and therefore, are actually UOC (MP) people because that Church is dominant in those regions).  I made this assumption for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, those regions of Ukraine are the least religious and therefore even the religious people there may be more casual about their faith.  Secondly, because Orthodoxy is more homogenous in eastern and southern Ukraine, and there are fewer conflicts, it makes sense that the believers would be less likely to identify their particular faith.  In a place in Volyn or Kiev in contrast, where battles have occurred between members of competing Churches, it is logical that people would be more likely to identify their particular Church.

But 70-80% seems possible (or who knows, it could be 50% or 60%).  If the higher figures are true, this would push the true number of adherents of the UOC (MP) close to the UOC (KP) in terms of numer of adherents, making the number of adherents approximately equal or, depending on the survey, possibly even surpassing the UOC - KP.  One of the surveys listed, Survey 2, doesn't include the Orthodox (or other religious) of no particular denomination, and on that survey the number of adherents of the UOK (MP) is closer to the number of UOC - KP than on any of the surveys which do include unspecified religious people.  This suggests that more \"unaffiliated\" actually belong to the UOC (MP) than UOC - KP.\n+\n+All of this is merely ''my speculation'' and for this reason doesn't belong in the article of course.

He then proceeds to list the number of communities, monasteries and churches that each of the churches owns or controls. Based on those numbers he correctly concludes that the UOC-MP is the largest branch and the UOC-Kyiv Patriarchate is a distant second.

What I propose to do is as follows. We simply state in the article that surveys produce the unreliable results and are difficult to use to give any estimates within reasonable accuracy (I elaborated above why: divergence and confusion). We may further state that both churches are clearly leading all the rest by the number of adherents. We move all survey results, with explanations to the footnotes and may add in text that despite the divergence, some surveys suggest the advantage of KP (caveat, we do have to say that they are unreliable, see above). The number of parishes data is unquestionably reliable. It should be given as no one actually doubts these numbers. We may further add that there is a caveat here as well since small or large parish still counts as one and it is rather unreliable to infer the numbers of adherents from the numbers of the parishes. \n+\n+We do not change the order of the churches for now since when sections are swapped differences are harder to trace.

However, I question your characterization of the survey results as unreliable (having designed and conducted research using surveys for my doctoral work I know a little bit about them).  Because the results are remarkably similiar across most surveys (as outlined by me, above), they are indeed [[Reliability (statistics)\n+|reliable]].  For example, when you claimed that two of the surveys had wildly different results and added the numbers:\n+\n+:UOC - 37.8%, KP - 28.7%, UGCC - 18.6%  \n+\n+:UOC - 20.4%, KP - 30.1%, UGCC - 7.8%, UAOC - 1.5%   \n+\n+:You didn't take into account that the first one was based on total number of believers (about 40% of the population), while the second one was out of the total population.  So the numbers as you posted them were measuring two different things.  When I multiplied the numbers from the first survey by .4 (because only 40% of the population, according to the first survey, specified their belief), the results became quite consistent with respect to all the churches other than the UOC-KP and UOC (MP):\n+\n+:UOC - 15.1%, KP - 11.5%, UGCC - 7.44% (religious but no particular religion - 29%)\n+:UOC - 20.4%, KP - 30.1%, UGCC - 7.8%, UAOC - 1.5%  \n+\n+:This highlights that the problem with the survey results is limited only with respect to whether the OAC (MP) has more adherents than does the UOC-KP.  This probably reflects people's genuine attitudes (confusion about the two Orthodox Churches, being undecided, not caring about which Orthodox Church they belong to, not wishing to differentiate the two, etc.) rather than the surveys' poor reliability which after all show remarkably similar results for the UGCC.    \n+\n+:A small number of (2) surveys, whose results are posted by Qe2, don't include \"no particular religion\" as an option - these ones consistently show greater adherence to the UOC-KP than the UOC (MP).  This suggests that the UOC-KP indeed has more adherents.  A question arises with respect to the valdity of those two surveys, however.  Since we know that when given the option a relatively large number fo people don't specify their Orthodoxy, how accurate are those surveys that fail to give as an option, no specific Orthodoxy?  This is not a question of reliability (the results of the the surveys are consistent) but validity (how accurately do those consistant results really measure what they claim to measure - i.e., people's religious adherence).  I think the validity of the two surveys that don't include unspecified religion or Orthodoxy as an option is questionable, given the well-known number of people who when given that option don't specify their particular Orthodoxy.         \n+\n+:When the \"Modern Times\" section is rewritten, I recommend that we use one category, Orthodoxy, describe it as by far the largest religion in Ukraine.  Within this section we describe the three-way split within Orthodoxy and then include a brief discussion of survey data and parish data with limitations of each method of measurement.  With respect to surveys and adherents, it would read something like this: \"Most surveys show that more people identify themselves as belonging to the UOC - KP than to the UOC (MP).  However, such a high number of people do not specify their allegience to either of the two Church across most surveys that it is unclear from survey data which of the two main Orthodox Churches actually has the highest number of adherents.\"  I would also include the regional variation and impact on recent politics.

This might compare, for example, to surveys of U.S. voters which include Indpendent as a choice for party affiliation.  One might write, were Independents to show a larger number, that, for example, \"Democrats outnumber Republicans, but a sifnificant number of Independents exist\", but I do not believe that one would write \"it is unclear from survey data which of the two main political parties actually has the highest number of followers.\"  The only survey that shows the UOC-MP outnumbering the UOC-KP is the one commissioned by the UGCC which is not directly comparable because it used the name UOC instead of UOC-MP.  My understanding is also that it is normal practice in statistics not to allow a single outlying result to redifine the conclusion; the data should, of course, be noted, but a single survey should not be overly weighted, especially one that was commissioned by one the interested parties. (My impression is that, although the UGCC did entrust the surveying to a reputable indepedent agency, it was the UGCC itself which decided to use the registered name \"UOC\" for the the \"UOC-MP\".  While their reasons may have been noble, this highlights one of the problems with surveys that are not entirely independent.  Then again, thanks to that survey, we can see that there do exist a significant number of people who consider themselves members of the UOC, but not the UOC-MP, which is, in itself, useful information.)\n+\n+::One cannot assume that those who consider themselves Orthodox of no jurisdication are undecided; it is not impossible or unlikely that many of these are honestly Orthodox and honestly do not consider themselves members of either \"jurisdiction\".  The fact that they exist does not in any way reduce the number of faithful in any other Church. If one looks at the various sets of data regarding church sizes in the United States cited on the adherents.com website [http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html#bodies], one can see that all cited surveys, including those by the Pew Research Center, rank size of bodies from largest to smaller based upon those who express a preference.

The connection was very strong indeed but it belongs to a history rather than modernity. At the time of the Polish controle up to the 17th-18th century, being a Ukrainian largely meant being an Orthodox and converion to Catholicism meant usually a complete abandonment of Ukrainianness. Practically it was equivalent to becoming a Pole (see [[Polonization#Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kostom/kostom22.htm Ostrozhsky] section of [[Kostomarov]]'s history.) \n-\n-Another historic period where the connection was very strong is the [[interbellum]] where in the Polish control Western Ukraine, the Greek Catholic church, which under the previous century of the Austrian rule has attained a  strong Ukrainian national character was a strong unifyinf force that prevented the Ukrainians from assimilation (see [[Polonization#Second Polish Republic]] and, eg. Snyder's \"Reconstruction of Nations\" ISBN 0-300-10586-X). However, in the modern times, the religion's role in the Ukrainian self-identity is not as significant. A significant portion of Ukrainians is non-religious and many have been attracted by the proseletysm of different Western Churches whose activity in the country is very significant in the last 20 years. Nevertheless, there is no indication that those people have lost their Ukrainian self-identification by being non-Orthodox and non-Greek Catholic.

One of the surveys listed, Survey 2, doesn't include the Orthodox (or other religious) of no particular denomination, and on that survey the number of adherents of the UOK (MP) is closer to the number of UOC - KP than on any of the surveys which do include unspecified religious people.

This is done ''despite'' UOC-MP is an incorrect name, strictly speaking, as the name of the church is just UOC, but this is a side question.

The point is that ''the question is confusing'' and this is why people give different answers from survey to survey. I suggest we avoid stating which church has more adherents because bot number of parishes statistics and Survey statistics is unreliable ''in this case'' to infer the answer. Why number of Parishes cannot serve the base of number of adherents is obvious. The large parish can have more adherents than three small ones. The surveys also do not allow to draw any reliable conclusion as otherwise, we would not have different denominations leading from survey to survey. They do allow to estimate the number of Greek Catholics, because unlike the other numbers, their percentage is consistent. I tend to agree with Faustian that the reason is both lack of firm identification between different Orthodox branches (unlike between non-Orthodox and Orthodox), weak religiousity of a large number of people (still not weak enough to call themseves atheist) and that the questions are confusing for many. Remember my analogy above that inferring anything from a survey when the questions are simple and clear for everyone (What language do you use at home?) is much more meaningful than to infer anything from a much more politically charged and confusing question (Do you support Russian to become a second state language?)

I beleive that Ukrainian Sociological Services is indeed a respectable institution but even they failed to produce any kind of confinsing consistency.

But anyway, here is what I know (or I think I know). The canonical status and recognition are two different (while related) things while the universal recognition usually signifies the full canonical status. [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] may choose to recognize someone or something but this by itself does not solve the whole host of problems. First of all, if it indeed \"granted\" Autocephaly to UAOC, this would have been very strange. Autocephaly may only be \"granted\" by the [[mother church]] and even this is not a miraculous solution of the problems. Example: Constantinople tends to not recognize any Autocephaly or Autonomy of any church unless it is granted by Constantinople itself. The OCA status is an example of this strange state of affairs. It's status of the canonical body in the N.A. is not disputed but some patriarchates led by Constantinople do not recognize it's self-governing status. See [http://www.oca.org/QAindex.asp?SID=3 this] for more. Does it mean that they consider it part of ROC? The clear answer to this question is very difficult to find. So, we would really have to find out what was there in that Tomos and whether the statement mentioned there was an official statement by Constantinople or the opinion of one of its Bishops. It is easy to confuse the two. For example there is frequently cited opinion that Constantinople \"does not recognize\" UOC under the MP or other similar unclear nonsense. They are all based on a whimsical interview given at one point of time by one Bishop under the Constantinople, the Archbishop Vsevolod (Maydansky) who is actually with the UOC of the USA (a spin-off from UAOC accepted by Constantinople). As for the official position of the EP, there is nothing more clear than the statement of the [[Patriarch Bartolomeo]] where he says that Filaret is not consider a church hierarch by anyone in the Orthodoxy. Also note that even Vsevolod, as well as any other supreme bishops, accepts the clerics of the KP into the Orthodox church only through a \"repentance\" procedure. Bear in mind that [[schism]] in Eastern Orthodoxy is considered a crime.\n+\n+Now, the reality is of course affected by politics. As decades or sometimes centuries pass the facts on the ground affect the actions of the hierarchs of the established churches as well as the status of the \"relatively new\" churches. This has not happened here yet and is nowhere in sight either for KP or for UAOC whose position is better in some respects and worse in some others. An established historic tradition (it's almost 100 years old), the de-facto legacy in some territories and partial recognition of its spin-offs helps UAOC somewhat. The mess it is currently in hurts it about as much. Firm state support and nationalist rhetoric helps KP in some respect but the total lack of recognition hurts it, perhaps, more or at least as much.\n+\n+The keys fromk this mess is of course in Moscow right now. The day MP decides to grant a full autocephaly to UOC from its current autonomous status would effectively end any meaningful position of Filaret, his KP and UAOC. From the canonical standpoint Ukraine already has a \"local church\" (pomestnaya tserkov') which is no one else but UOC and no one can seriously dispute that. Its lack of full autocephaly allows some to politicize the debate and boosts the claims of other churches. However, Moscow is understandably not eager to do such step as after this there would be no return and the century old churches have to think from the perspective of longer than a decade or two. It may seem to them that the current set of events with Ukrainian independence from Russia is not assured to be an eternal change. Some hundreds years ago this already has happened and yet reversed. Position of myself, Faustian, QE2, KK and even Jimbo Wales in respect to this is irrelevant. Certainly the last parliamentary election have likely raised some hopes in Moscow, not necessarily about the \"re-unification\" but about the overall trends. So, Moscow would be on no rush to grant autocephaly and this disarray will continue, at least for some time, unless it is solved by an unexpected and miraculous event. But hey, this is religion!

First of all, if Constantinope indeed \"granted\" Autocephaly to UAOC in 1924, this would have been very strange. Autocephaly may only be \"granted\" by the [[mother church]] and even this is not a instant solution of all the problems. Example: Constantinople tends to not recognize any Autocephaly or Autonomy of any church unless it is granted by Constantinople itself. The OCA status is an example of this strange state of affairs. Its status of the canonical body in the N.A. is not disputed but some patriarchates led by Constantinople do not recognize its self-governing status. See [http://www.oca.org/QAindex.asp?SID=3 this] for more. Does it mean that they consider it part of ROC? The clear answer to this question is very difficult to find. So, we would really have to find out what was there in that Tomos and whether the statement mentioned there was an official statement by Constantinople or the opinion of one of its Bishops. It is easy to confuse the two. For example there is frequently cited in press confusion that Constantinople \"does not recognize\" UOC under the MP or other similar unclear nonsense. They are all based on a whimsical interview given at one point of time by one Bishop under the Constantinople, the Archbishop Vsevolod (Maydansky) who is actually with the UOC of the USA (a spin-off from UAOC accepted by Constantinople). As for the official position of the EP, there is nothing more clear than the statement of the [[Patriarch Bartholomew I]] where he says that Filaret is not consider a church hierarch by anyone in the Orthodoxy. Also note that even Vsevolod, as well as any other supreme bishop, accepts the clerics of the KP into the Orthodox church only through a \"repentance\" procedure. Bear in mind that [[schism]] in Eastern Orthodoxy is considered a crime.\n \n Now, the reality is of course affected by politics. As decades or sometimes centuries pass the facts on the ground affect the actions of the hierarchs of the established churches as well as the status of the \"relatively new\" churches. This has not happened here yet and is nowhere in sight either for KP or for UAOC whose position is better in some respects and worse in some others. An established historic tradition (UAOC is almost 100 years old), the de-facto legacy in some territories and partial recognition of its spin-offs helps UAOC somewhat. The mess it is currently in hurts it about as much. Firm state support and nationalist rhetoric helps KP in some respect but the total lack of recognition hurts it, perhaps, more or at least as much.\n "}

However according to wiki about the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] in 1924 when the Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory VII issued a tomos re-establishing the Kievan Rus-Ukrainian Metropolitan diocese as an Autocephalous Church. The responsibility of establishing a new Synod of Bishops was given to the Metropolitan-Archbishop of Warsaw, Dionisij (Waledynskyj) (the Polish Orthodox Church was basically made up mostly of ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusyns).  The UOAC Church abroad descends from those bishops and priests who fled Ukraine after World War II and who then merged witht he Ukrainian Orthodox Churches already there.  This story is told in the wiki entry on [[Patriarch Mstyslav (Stepan Skrypnyk)]], and the line of apostolic succession is [http://www.uaoc.org/en/history/apostolic.html here].

Its lack of full autocephaly, its involvement in politics being comparable to that of KP's involvement as well as many other political struggles allow to politicize the religious debate and boosts the claims of other churches. However, Moscow is understandably not eager to do such step as after this there would be no return and the century old churches have to think from the perspective of longer than a decade or two. It may seem to them that the current set of events with Ukraine's becoming mroe and more independent from Russia is not assured to be an eternal change. Some hundreds years ago this already has happened and yet reversed. Position of myself, Faustian, QE2, KK and even Jimbo Wales in respect to this is irrelevant. Certainly the last parliamentary election has likely raised some hopes in Moscow, not necessarily about the \"re-unification\" but about the overall trends. So, Moscow would be in no rush to grant autocephaly and this disarray will continue, at least for some time, unless it is solved by an unexpected and miraculous change. But, hey, this is religion!

It may seem to them that the current set of events with Ukraine's becoming more and more independent from Russia is not assured to be an eternal change. Some hundreds years ago this already has happened and yet reversed. Position of myself, Faustian, QE2, KK and even Jimbo Wales in respect to this is irrelevant. Certainly the last parliamentary election has likely raised some hopes in Moscow, not necessarily about the \"re-unification\" but about the overall trends. So, Moscow would be in no rush to grant autocephaly and this disarray will continue, at least for some time, unless it is solved by an unexpected and miraculous change. But, hey, this is religion! So miracles may happen, you know. Isn't miracle a synonym of the \"act of God\"? --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 22:25, 7 March 2007 (UTC)\n+\n+:P.S. It would be interesting to find out whether the Ukrainian bishops in the US and Canada were RE-ordained or not when their churches were received by Constantinople (in the 1990s). The latter would imply that their hierarchical status was accepted as it was and the former would clearly mean that even Constantinople saw their churches outside of the Communion prior to receiving them.\n+\n+:To remind you, this event  caused the significant rift within the Ukrainian church in the US. Some parishes decided to move under Filaret's KP. Later, some of them chose to revert and when they turned again to UOC/USA the  Archbishop Vsevolod (Maydansky) of UOC/USA only received those clerics back through a canonical procedure of repentance and re-ordainment.

From what I have read in different analysis of churches that coexist in the certain terriotry, not only in UA, it is the number of parishes that's the most frequently mentioned factor in estimating their relative strength. Yes, there are US survey numbers for the number of baptists, episcopalians, etc, but much literature uses the naumbers of parishes. The reason probably is that the latter number is, while not always precisely, related to the number of adherents, and is much better known. It also may be that there are some sensitivities in conducting such surveys even in much more religiously stable areas than Ukraine. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 03:05, 8 March 2007 (UTC)\n \n+:Another update: this is not really for an article as my personal observation do not count and I am not a survey taker. Just got off the phone with someone who lives in Eastern Ukraine's large city. Like most cities there, it is large Russophone and dominated by UOC. The person is not very much into politics and  attends the church but not very regularly. When she mentioned that, I got curious and asked, whose church is she now going to. She told me the name of the Saint to whom the Church is named. I then tried to find out whether it is UOC's or KP's church. I tried to ask in different ways and could not get the firm answer. I asked, Volodymyr's or Filaret's? In response I was given the name of the Saint to whom the Church is named. I tried to dig from another side and asked \"Russian or Ukrainian?\" The answer was \"Ukrainian, everything is now Ukrainian\" (the latter meaning not religion or language, but \"of Ukraine\", like even [[Party of Regions]] is a Ukrainian party despite most of them speak Russian.) Desperate I asked then \"Whose Patriarchate?\" She answered \"What?\". I had to ask a [[leading question]]. \"Moscow Patriarchate\" or \"Kiev Patriarchate\"? She immediately said \"Kiev\". And added, \"Kiev and Moscow are different now. Each of us now has its own borders\". Point is, that my respondent is totally apolitical. She lives in a Russophone city E.UA city and the chance is very strong that the church she goes to, as well as the majority of the churches there, are UOC. She was not able to tell me anything and when I finally asked \"Kiev or Moscow\", she said Kiev because she of course knows that she lives in Ukraine, Kiev is the capital of Ukraine while Moscow is Russia.\n+\n+:Perhaps, that's how the survey numbers show what they show.

These are particularly evident when compared to the liturgical norms of the Russian Orthodox church. The priest in a Ukrainian church traditionally reads the Gospel facing the congregation, while in the Russian church he is turned away from them; moreover, the Ukrainian priest keeps the Royal Gates of the iconostasis open considerably longer than does the Russian. After the subjugation of the Ukrainian Orthodox to the Russian Orthodox church in the 18th century, numerous Russian elements were introduced into the liturgy in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox church that emerged after 1917 reformed the liturgy (including abbreviations) and revived many old Ukrainian traditions. These traditions are now observed by Ukrainian Orthodox jurisdictions in the West, but the Orthodox church under the Moscow patriarch retains the Russian elements.\n+\n+In the 17th century, sermons were delivered in bookish Belarusian-Ukrainian combined with vernacular elements. Both the Orthodox and Uniate churches placed much emphasis on the clarity of sermons. Sermons were usually preached after the reading of the Gospel in Uniate churches, while Orthodox priests as a rule delivered their sermons at the end of the Divine Liturgy. \n+\n+When in the late 17th century the Ukrainian Orthodox church came under the control of Moscow, the hitherto common homiletical practices of the Orthodox and Uniate churches began to diverge. \n+\n+As a result of systematic Russification, homiletics in the Ukrainian language progressively declined in the 19th century. \n+\n+In the Ukrainian Catholic church, the 18th century saw the continuation of developments of the previous century, and the Ukrainian bookish, and later the vernacular, language replaced Church Slavonic in homiletics. The Russian authorities persecuted, and by 1830 abolished, the Ukrainian Catholic church in the territory under their control. That church continued its legal existence only in Austrian-ruled Western Ukraine. \n+\n+At the turn of the 19th century the clergy in Western Ukraine began using the vernacular in their sermons and publications. Sermons were published in the vernacular by Mykhailo Luchkai (2 vols, 1831), T. Vytvytsky (2 vols, 1847), and Antin Dobriansky (1850) and in supplements to such newspapers as Zoria halytska (1853–4). \n+\n+The Ukrainian Orthodox church was restored under the Ukrainian National Republic in 1917 and survived in Soviet Ukraine until the early 1930s. During this time homiletics was fostered by the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox church (UAOC). From the 1930s sermons in Soviet Ukraine were delivered mostly in Russian (except in the Western Ukrainian regions annexed in 1944).\n+\n+Homiletics has developed normally outside the Soviet bloc within all the Ukrainian churches.\n+\n+[[User:Bandurist|Bandurist]] ([[User talk:Bandurist|talk]]) 17:15, 20 November 2007 (UTC)"}

The fact is if you walk the streets of Ukrainian citises and villages and ask them a question \"What is your religios church affiliation ? \" , something like 60-70 % will say Orthodox Christian, may be 10 % will say Greko-Catholic, 10-20 % will say none/atheist, and may be 1-3 % will say they are Protestant (Baptist or Pentacstal) [[User:Fisenko|Fisenko]] 04:41, 7 November 2005 (UTC)\n-:Yes you be right.

People may have no clue about canonical disputes within the Eastern Ortohodoxy, people may attend the Church 2-10 times in their lifetime (Baptism, wedding, funeral and those of someone else). Those who occasionally stop by for Easter in addition to those happy/tragic rare events are about as much reiligous as those that don't. So, we should make it clear in the article the fact that Ukrainians are overwhelmingly EO or GC. \n-\n-Church attendance, OTOH, is also a factual info and may be included but only such that it won't mislead the reader into thinking that Ukraine is more Protestant than it actually is. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 18:20, 7 November 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-\n-\n-==Constructive Work==\n-Anyway I broke down the article into a structure, ommited the edits of the vandals that refuse to discuss them (they could have been kept had they explaind them...)

My apologies if this is the wrong place to post, as I see that discussion regarding the use of registered parish counts also takes place lower down.\n-\n-Parish counts cannot be relied upon as an indicator of popular support because it is very easy for any group so motivated to register a number of \"paper parishes\", registered communities that do not actually exist.  All that one requires to register a parish in Ukraine is the names of ten adult Ukrainian citizens.  Possible motivation for doing so would include a desire for a particular group to appear to have more support than actually, a desire to influence local authorities responsible for granting use of church buildings, and a hope of obtaining a larger share of properties when permanent division does take place. Whether or not such has actually happened, the possibility decreases the value of parish counts as an indicator of popular or relative support.\n-\n-Surveys of the population are, meanwhile, the most common measure of relative strength of religious groups.  See, for example, adherants.com or the surveys conducted by the Pew charitable trust.  I would therefore agree, as suggested below, that the article should reflect neutral surveys and estimates.\n-\n-By that same token, it seems that the order of the UOC-KP and UOC(MP) should be reversed in the article, as it is standard practice in English language literature to list groups in size from largest to smallest based on number of adherants.  Agains, see the many surveys and estimates provided in, or linked to by, adherants.com. [[User:Qe2|Qe2]] 16:50, 9 February 2007 (UTC)\n-:So if a parish is part of a whole church building, and the fact that by the amount of churches, not parsishes, the UOC(MP) outnumbers UOC-KP 3:1 is in your opinion irrelevant? --[[User:Kuban kazak|Kuban Cossack]] 00:49, 10 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-\n-\n-== Protestants in Ukraine ==\n-\n-The current article makes reference to the Studist sect of the German Evangelical (Lutheran) movement in Ukraine.

Why because regardless of who publishes the survey, it will have a substantial skew towards the publisher's author. Moreover as surveys are not censuses and there are no actual authentic figures, just summations, it classes as [[WP:NOR]]. So its better we do not add them altogether. If anything I can give equal surveys that will make the UOC(MP) as the dominant church of the population of Ukraine....

[[National Jewish Population Survey| Good surveys]] certainly have a place in wikipedia.  The survey I quoted was not conducted by a particular Church brotherhood or some marginal organization like that, but by the well known as well established Ukrainian Sociological Service whose surveys have been conducted on many topics, such as politics [http://www.fraza.com.ua/news/22.11.06/30958.html][http://www.ukrpartinform.com/news/gallup-poll/436b897527e18/] [http://ukrweekly.com/Archive/1999/429901.shtml], and the results of its surveys have appeared on a web-site of the Ukrasinian government [http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/printable_article?art_id=22744686].  This is a legitimate, professional organization whose shouldn't be dismissed off-hand.\n-\n-:If you can find other surveys (hopefully, not conducted by the Orthodox Brotherhood) that show different results for Ukrainian religious affiliation than please add the info.  Then we can make the article state that \"different surveys provide different estimates\" or something to that effect.\n-\n-:The comments about the survey that you quoted are interesting but refer only to personal experiences, which are valuable but doesn't belong on the article main page.\n-\n-:Also, you removed the US governments' estimate of religious adherents in Ukraine, taken from the CIA Worldfactbook.  The Factbook is used as a source on numerous wiki articles such as [[Demographics of Ukraine]], [[Demographics of Moldova]] and the statistics section for the demographics of Poland [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Poland#Statistical_indicators].  I see no reason why those estimates should be removed from the estimates of religious adherents within Ukraine.  \n-\n-:So, I am adding the info that you have removed and urge you to add other info to balance it out, if it exists.  I, certainly, would be interested in seeing it.  warmly  [[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 19:58, 7 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-I agree about the usefulness and usability of the surveys in general, provided they are conducted by respected organizations. This particular case, however, has a caveat that KK has correctly pointed out. Most lay people have little interest in the church politics and, while it is hard to come up with estimates, a significant group of Ukrainians do not know much about Orthodox divisions within Ukraine. For many religious self-identification does not go beyond being able to self-identify as Orthodox, Greek-Catholic or a Jehova's witness. To know the details of UOC's rivarly one either needs to follow the issue in the news or be personally involved in the interchurch fights (like witnessing one's own church being commandeered by the paramilitary assistants of either faction or even take part in those series of captures). Certainly if one can self-identify with the national church and state that it is under a patriarch abroad (UOC(MP)), one is more likely to know exactly what one is saying. As such, I've seen dramatically opposite survey results for a relative membership between the major UOC churches. I will locate and find the quite different percentages, if necessary. At the same time, the the comparisons of the numbers of parishes, churches and communities are much more reliable. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 20:25, 7 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-:I look forward to the contrary survey results.  Do you feel that the CIA worldfactbook's figures (19% UOC-KP, 9% UOC-MP, 16% undetermined) may reflect that ambivalence? [[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 21:34, 7 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-::Come tothink of it, I remember reading something about different results being determined by extent of religiosity.  When surveys look at people who go to church regularly they tend to favor the UOC-KP, because such people are much more common in western and central Ukraine than in the UOC-MP's heartland.  When they ask about mere baptism or self-identification (rather than church attendance) the figures are different.  I don't recall where I read that so I won't put it up in the article however.  [[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 21:50, 7 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-:The major problem of the surveys is that it is simple to say that we asked 5000 people in all major cities in Ukraine, but this has one major flaw - Ukrainian society has a sharp rural/urban difference. Urban society, at most is brought up on Marxist, cosmopolitan ideals...where the majority of people are not regular church-goers. In fact it is something of similar to Soviet times, if before people were members of Comsomol and even the party, that did not mean that they actually were idiologically communist. What changed? It got a new name although retained the same abbreviation - КП, was founded by ex-Communists Kravchuk and Dinisenko, and if yesterday it talked about the bad influences of Trotskism, Maoism and Capitalism, today its any Russophilism/Moscowphilism. The only difference is that it is no longer compulsary to attend <s>meetings</s> services. The majority don't because they could not care less. \n-:With respect to the rural population, then for its majority, the people are traditional and conservative. It is hardly a wonder why the UOC(MP) statistically in all, minus the western regions, has absoloute majority in rural Ukraine. Most of the rural settlements are one church per selo. Moreover most of the construction of new churches takes place in rural areas. [http://orthodox.org.ua/uk/node/197]. Now wether or not the people of those rural settlements resent the fact that they are UOC(MP) church-goers is irrelevant, and until a full census is published - Original Research. Thus I advice we restrict to number of parishes alone. As for US gov data, then if its the same data source that suggested that Saddam had WMO that are still to be found...Nothing is credible here, hence I am removing them...--[[User:Kuban kazak|Kuban Cossack]] 13:39, 8 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-Sorry, but your personal views on the value of surveys should not invalidate them.  Surveys are generally recognized as legitimate ways of viewing public opinion, provided that they are conducted by professionals working for respected organization.  They are certainly used as sources throughout wikipedia.  As outlined earlier in the talk section, Ukrainian Sociological Service is a legitimate surveying organization whose data even appears on a Ukrainian government website.  There is no legitimate reason to exclude the data from their survey.  \n-\n-As for number of parishes - this is not a completely accurate indicator, because it may reflect better financing and doesn't take into account the size of parishes.  For example, the number of (western-financed) Protestant parishes seems to overrepresent the number of actual Protestant believers.  The best approach is to use parish size plus survey data (and hopefully irpen will find other surveys) to provice the most objective picture possible.\n-\n-Furthermore, it seems silly to wipe out estimates on topics such as US government estimates simply because of the fact that the US government got WMDs wrong (this is another and complicated matter - the public excuses for the Iraq war didn't match what analysts were saying).  Thw demographic info in the CIA Worldfactbook is used throughout wikipedia, in newspaper articles, etc.  It is also used as a basis for the [[NationMaster]] figures on Ukrainian religion [http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/rel_rel-religion-religions].  Even if you disagree about the credibility, it is an important fact that this is the US government's estimate and that this estimate is considered credible by various sources.  There is no legitimate reason to exclude those figures from this article.\n-\n-With all respect, tt seems you are pushing a non-nuetral point of view regarding the UOC-MP's popularity in Ukraine.  This is, unfortunately, a pattern with you.  I remember you have earlier claimed that almost all of the churches in Transcarpathia reverted to Orthodoxy in the 1920's-1930's, before I found the reference that stated that only 1/3 of them did.

From the beginning, the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitans]] of Kiev resided at [[Pereyaslav]] in [[Ukraine]], then Kiev([[1037]]). The identity and further separate development of the Kievan Church was achieved by the election of Metropolitans, native and/or not confirmed by the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] (Ilarion, [[1051]]-[[1054]]; Klym Smolyatich [[1147]]-[[1154]]; and, Gregory Tsamblak [[1415]]-[[1419]]). \n-\n-Following the [[Mongol invasion of Russia|Mongol annihilation]] of Kiev in the 13th century, the [[Metropolitan of Kiev]] moved to [[Vladimir]] in [[1299]]. By [[1326]], the Metropolitan had settled in [[Moscow]], and by [[1328]] had changed the title of Metropolitan of Kiev for the title [[Metropolitan of Moscow]]. The separate legal tradition of the Russian Church, as differentiated from the Church in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], was codified in the decision of the first properly Russian Church [[Council of the Hundred Chapters]] ('Stoglav') in [[1448]], followed by the formal separation of the Church of Rus' into separate Russian (Muscovite) and [[Ruthenia]]n (Kievan) Metropoliae in [[1453]].\n-\n-=== Middle Ruthenian period ===\n-Meanwhile, for the Church of Kiev, the loss of the Metropolitan of Kiev in [[1299]] was rapidly supplanted by the creation of the Metropolia of [[Halych]] for Southern Rus' in [[1303]].  In [[1352]], the [[Metropolitan of Halych]] began to relocate back to Kiev; thereafter, the Kievan Church was headed by the [[Metropolitan of Kiev-Halych and All Rus]].  The [[Metropolitan of Moscow]] opposed the creation of this Metropolia at Halych/Kiev. This Church governed most of the lands of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], often from the city of [[Navahrudak]] in today's Belarus.  Between [[1054]] and [[1448]], this Ruthenian Church continued to send representatives to the ecumenical councils called by the Pope of Rome {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, but also succumbed to increasing pressure by her mother church among Greek in Constantinople to cease communion with the Bishop ([[Pope]]) of Rome. Though Constantinople and Rome had their disputes, the Kievan hierarchy tried to work for Christian unity{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Representatives from Rus participated in the Western Councils of Lyon (1245) and Constance (1418). Isidore, the Metropolitan of Kiev, was himself one of the creators of the Union of Florence (1439).\n-\n-=== The era of Catholic-Orthodox rivalry and separation ===\n-The memory of the [[Council of Florence]] on the Ruthenian lands of Ukraine and Belarus, which had passed under the control of the states of [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]] after the decline of the Ukrainian-centered empire of [[Rus]]', bore concrete fruit in the [[Union of Brest]] (Berest') in [[1596]], which united the Ruthenian Church of the Ukrainian and Belarusyn lands of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] with the Pope of Rome. This union was not accepted by all the members of the Greek Church in these lands, and marked the beginning of the creation of separate Ukrainian Catholic and [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church|Ukrainian Orthodox]] Churches on the lands of [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]]. Due to violence, the Metropolitan of the Kievan Greek Catholic Church left Kiev early in the [[1600s]] and settled in Navahrudak and [[Wilno]] in Belarus.\n-\n-----\n-For Now...

Thus it is very easy to say that in Lviv most will choose UGCC, in Sevastopol - UOC(MP) and so on... This is just simple common sense (which quoted as a reason below). Now then we look at parish data, and what do you know, in Crimea UOC-KP has 2% and in Lviv UOC(MP) - 2%. Which matches the common sense. The only place that surveys can be reliable is in a 50:50 atmosphere like Kiev. Look combine the UOC(MP) with those of no particular choice, and then divide by UOC-KP and you obtain the same ratio as you would by dividing the no of UOC(MP)'s parishes by those of UOC-KP. Now continuing by using common sense, I can draw the conclusion that the people who said they have no preference adhere to the UOC(MP).

As a result you have Bulgarian Orthodox Churches in honour of Alexander Nevsky (as an example). UOC-KP on the other hand upon seizing a building would rename it to its own taste.

[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 16:49, 18 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-===A problem with surveys===\n-I do not deny the general usability of the surveys for the Wikipedia articles as a source of info but this is an issue which should be judged case by case. Questions of who conducted the survey, how obvious are their results, whether they are self-contradictory or not are important. \n-\n-[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;2964/ Here] is another related survey published on the very same web-site, RISU, and even taken by the same institution, the Ukrainian Sociology Service, as the survey used by Faustian. Let's take a look at these numbers:\n-\n-:''\"According to the survey, among the 70 percent of Ukrainians who consider themselves religious, 40 percent belong to particular religions and denominations and 29 percent have not decided on their religion. About 16 percent of people stated they are not religious and another 14 percent remain undecided.\"''\n-\n-So, 70% of population of Ukraine consider themselves religious, 16% are non-religious and 14% are \"unsure\". From those who claim being religious, just over a half consider themselves being part of a specific denomination, and the rest simply think that they \"have faith in God\" (40% vs 29%)\n-\n-Reading further:\n-\n-:''\"In addition, the survey revealed that the three biggest denominations in Ukraine are the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate (UOC-KP) and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC) with 37.8, 28.7 and 18.6 percent of the faithful respectively. The faithful of these churches constitute about 85 percent of Ukrainians who identified themselves as religious.\"''\n-\n-So, we have: \n-:UOC - 37.8%, UOC-KP - 28.7%, UGCC - 18.6%\n-\n-The numbers are rather surprizing compared to the results given in the [http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;13940 survey linked by Faustian] where we read:\n-:UOC - 20.4%, KP - 30.1%, UGCC - 7.8%, UAOC - 1.5%\n-\n-What is substantial is not even that UOC has such a clear advantage over KP, but how significantly the numbers differ from survey to survey published by the same source. Those surveys being taken two years apart cannot explain such a huge difference as 10% switching from UOC to KP. Even more startling would be the supposed conversion of millions of Ukrainians from Greek Catholicism to the Eastern Orthodoxy within two years. The conversion between Greek Catholic and Orthodox faith is a serious matter and millions do not just switch between different branches of Christianity in the period of two years. \n-\n-Now, there are CIA worldbook numbers which differ from both surveys. A simple common sense tells that CIA simply used some other survey as neither CIA nor even the Ukrainian authorities conduct the comprehensive censuses about the religious preferences of the Ukrainians. What we really see from those surveys is that people are confused. Besides, most of them do not even attend any church and give answers to the questions that not all of them even fully understand as only truly religious  ones are able to give an informed answer to such questions. \n-\n-As a result we get an arbitrary set of all confusing numbers that show dramatically different results from survey to survey. In view of this, we should either not use such survey data at all or, if we add it to the article, we should state that surveys produce contradictory results and are an unreliable indicator of anything. Additionally, some religious Ukrainians who are both nationally and religious conscious declare their allegiance to KP and even may attend their Church for the [[Easter]] service but when it comes to baptizing the newborn, they take the baby to the UOC as they are conscious about Baptism being the way to [[salvation]] and to be sure the later is guaranteed, they go to the church whose being \"truly within the Orthodox Christianity\" is beyond reproach (speaking strictly from the Eastern Orthodoxy POV the non-canonical churches are not \"truly Orthodox\" and the rites they perform are not valid). I read about this phenomenon somewhere and I can even look for a source, but since I am not about to add this to the article, I do not think is necessary. I am simply pointing out how meaningless all this statistics is and this is the reason of the numbers contradicting each other.\n-\n-As the same time, the numbers of parishes is taken from the documents filed with the State Committee for the Religious Affairs. The leaders of the parishes cannot not know exactly what denomination they belong. This is reliable and encyclopedic info.\n-\n-:::: The same statistics also show that in Ukraine there are over 6,000 protestant and Jehova's witnesses parishes in Ukraine.  Is this data less scientific than the data showing the large number of UOC (MP) parishes?  Is protestantism Ukraine's seciond largest religion, almost on par with UOC (MP)?  Of course it is not, and the data from surveys is the thing that injects some reality in opposition to the statistics on number of parishes.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 16:05, 19 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-As for the surveys, when the question is clear, like \"What language do you use primarily at home?\", the results of such surveys are more valid than when the question is \"Do you support the idea of the Russian language becoming the state language in Ukraine?\", as the latter question understandably is much more confusing. By asking people confusing questions one can easily get contradictory results. For instance in the  March 17, 1991 referendum 80.2% of Ukrainian population voted for Ukraine's joining the renovated USSR and on December 1 of the same year 92% of population voted for the Ukrainian full independence. Manipulation with these data by POV pushers may be used for all sorts of speculations in either direction.\n-\n-The surveys with the more confusing questions are especially vulnerable to challenges if they produce wildly different results from survey to  survey. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 01:06, 18 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-: Do you think that the difference in figures is accounted for by the first figure being ''of the faithful'' and the second being of the general population?

If you have a sampling of 100 people of who only 10 are religious and 4, 3, 2 and 1 belong to the demoniations A, B, C and D, respectively, the percentages would be 40%, 30%, 20% and 10% of the  faithful, respectively, and 4%, 3%, 2% and 1% of the total number of people but the largest denomination would remain the largest no matter what you use as the base. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 07:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-:::I think I need not reply to this, or to your comment above, at this point it is either we dump the surveys alogether or move up the [[WP:DR]] process.

If an issue is unresolved in this article, why do you change it in other articles?

I suggest that we do what I had originally proposed - state that the issue is controversial, and show data representing the different viewpoints rather than only one side's surveys.  Show the parish data, then mention its drawback; and show the figures from a few surveys.

UOC-KP is definetly going AFTER the UOC(MP) not only from the inflated results that the survey showed, which Irpen's findings show 100% forgery, but also because the UOC-KP has much more paper parishes than UOC(MP).

Challenge that! --[[User:Kuban kazak|Kuban Cossack]] 14:15, 19 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-You are clearly becoming too emotionally involved in this discussion.  I doubt that Irpen suggested that the surveys were \"100% forgeries\", just that they contained inconsistencies and therefore that they are far from perfect as a source of information.  Every source of info contains advantages and disadvantages.  The number of new church buildings may reflect funding, not number of adherants, for instance.  After all, does the building of the massive UGCC cathedral in Kiev signify that Kievans have turned to Catholicism?  The number of old church buildings might reflect the fact that the UOC (MP) is the heir of the owner of all church buildings in Ukraine prior to the 1990's.  \n-\n-It is best to simply put in all the data - the survey data (both sides), the number of parishes, number of buildings, with brief explanations of what this means.  You seem to want to \"cherry pick\" the pieces of data that magnify the importance of the UOC (MP) and to ignore everything else, no matter how legitimate, that supports a different conclusion.  Your dismissal of [[Andrew Wilson (historian)|Andrew Wilson]]'s claim as the product of some sort of conspiracy is quite illustrative of that.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 15:34, 19 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-:I am not seeing the surveys as forgeries but I see them as totally unreliable.

However, the problem is not researchers' lack of professionalism, but the lack of firm denominational identity among respondents. Actually, this is not a problem for the Eastern Rite Catholic Church because it consistently accounts for six to eight percent of the adult population of Ukraine in surveys. It is more complicated with Protestants because some surveys do not \"catch\" them at all. For example, Jehovah's Witnesses, some Pentecostals, and even some Baptists do not respond to the name Protestant. Yet, Protestant denominations that have a fixed membership are easy to count. The All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christian-Baptist Church has 130,000 members, the All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christians (Pentecostal) has about 90,000 members, the Ukrainian Union of Seventh-day Adventists has about 40,000 members, and Jehovah's Witnesses have about 107,000 members. The above Protestants, plus members of charismatic and independent churches (excluding Reformed and Lutherans), cannot be more than 600,000 to 700,000. Without question, their influence on religious life is much higher than their numbers would suggest.

According to the largest and most comprehensive poll undertaken in 1997, 65.7% of the sample considered themselves believers, and of these 62.5% expressed an allegiance to a particular Church.  Of the latter, 12.3% declared themselves supporters of the UOC (MP) and a further 11.6% claimed to belong to the Russian Orthodox Church, although technically it no longer exists in Ukraine (its supporters can basically be grouped together with those of the Moscow patriarchate).  An impressive 43% named the UOC (KP) and only 4% the Autocephalous Orthodox.  Greek Catholics accounted for 14.3%, concentrated overwhelmingly in the western regions of Galicia and Transcarpathia.\"\n-\n-\"Considerable differences were apparent between Ukraine east and west of the Dnieper (the only regional breakdown available for the figures).

I suggest the article include the parish info, (and describe limitations of it), and add something like \"in contrast to the number of parishes, most surveys state that UOC (KP) has more adherents, although other surveys state the opposite,\" reference the various surveys, and add a statement that the truth is not definitively known.  Also briefly state the limitations of survey data in general and probably mention lower numbers of believers in the UOC (MP) territory in southern and eastern Ukraine as a possible explanation for the discrepency between UOC (MP) greater number of parishes versus UOC (MP) a la Andrew Wilson.

For example, survey one [http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;2964] stated that only 40% of the population belongs to a particular religion and the figures provided are for those 40% rather than for the general population.

Feel free to add others.  Five scientific, respected surveys have been listed above, along with data from the Worldfactbook which presumably is also based on a scientific survey.  The conclusions so far:\n-\n-With resepct to adherence to the UGCC and UAOC, the results are '''quite consistant'''.  Across ''all six surveys'', about 6-8% of the Ukrainian population identifes itself as Greek Catholic and 1-2% as belonging to the UAOC.\n-\n-Now, let's look at the two largest Orthodox Churches.\n-\n-Five of the surveys allow the choice \"Orthodox of no particular jurisdiction.\"  Of these, the numbers are remarkably consistant on four of the five surveys, with the UOC (MP) having the adherence of about 7-12% of the population and the KP of 19-22% of the population.  On only one survey the UOC (MP) has the advantage, but even there it is a rather slight one (15.1% versus 11.5% of the general population).  The Orthodox situation is somewhat muddled because in each survey a huge number of Orthodox adherents do not list a particular preference.            \n-\n-I see no reason to question the validity of the surveys based on \"inconsistent results\", as the results are indeed rather consistant across most surveys and any variance is logically explainable. \n-\n-Therefore, the conclusions based on the survey data should stand.  The write-up should summarize the results of all the scientific surveys.  The number of adherents of the UGCC should be described as 6-8% of the general population and of the UAOC as 1-2% of the general population.  The article should describe the limitation of specific numbers for Orthodox due to the large number of people who do not express loyalty to a particular Church.  However, it should note that of those who ''do'' identify specifically, most surveys show greater allegience to the UOC-KP than the UOC (MP).  This does not, of course, necessarily mean that the UOC (KP) has more adherents.  It could mean that people who follow the UOC - KP are more likely to identify themselves as such while people who attend UOC (MP) Churches might be more likely to merely consider themselves \"Orthodox\".  Or they might not be.  We simply don't know what kind of churches those who consider themselves of no particular demonination actually attend based on the survey data.  This should problem should also be explained in the article.  In general, the survey evidence suggests that the UOC (MP) and UOC - KP are about evenly matched in terms of adherents.    \n-\n-What do you think, Irpen?  regards [[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 16:20, 20 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-:Faustian, I, for one, thank you for taking the time to collate and present this data and readily agree with the approach you suggest, although I am not certain I understand why the \"evidence suggests that the UOC (MP) and UOC - KP are about evenly matched in terms of adherents\". There is only one survey that suggests a comparable or greater support for the UOC(MP), and that survey was exceptional as the UOC(MP) was identified merely as the \"UOC\", not the \"UOC(MP)\" as in the other surveys.  It seems that the only observation that can be made is that there are a large number of Ukrainians who would consider themselves members of the UOC, but not of the UOC(MP).  I suspect that many of these are those who would consider themselves \"Orthodox of no particular jurisdiction\" in other surveys.  Still, I am all for preseting a write up of all of the available data, including that survey.  [[User:Qe2|Qe2]] 16:53, 20 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-Thank you for your kind words.  I wrong in stating that ''the evidence suggests'' that the UOC (MP) and KP are evenly matched.  Rather, this was my educated guess based upon the presumption that most of the ones of no particular denomination are from southern and eastern Ukraine (and therefore, are actually UOC (MP) people because that Church is dominant in those regions).  I made this assumption for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, those regions of Ukraine are the least religious and therefore even the religious people there may be more casual about their faith.  Secondly, because Orthodoxy is more homogenous in eastern and southern Ukraine, and there are fewer conflicts, it makes sense that the believers would be less likely to identify their particular faith.  In a place in Volyn or Kiev in contrast, where battles have occurred between members of competing Churches, it is logical that people would be more likely to identify their particular Church.  On the other hand, it is also possible that some UOC - KP people do not endorse their own Church because they oppose the splits within Orthodoxy. \n-\n-I seriously doubt that 100% or even 90% of the unaffiliated are indeed UOC (MP).  But 70-80% seems possible (or who knows, it could be 50% or 60%).  If the higher figures are true, this would push the true number of adherents of the UOC (MP) close to the UOC (KP) in terms of numer of adherents, making the number of adherents approximately equal or, depending on the survey, possibly even surpassing the UOC - KP.  One of the surveys listed, Survey 2, doesn't include the Orthodox (or other religious) of no particular denomination, and on that survey the number of adherents of the UOK (MP) is closer to the number of UOC - KP than on any of the surveys which do include unspecified religious people.  This suggests that more \"unaffiliated\" actually belong to the UOC (MP) than UOC - KP.\n-\n-All of this is merely ''my speculation'' and for this reason doesn't belong in the article of course.  We don't really know which of the two main Orthodox Churches are larger because of the very high number of unspecified Orthodox.  [[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 23:53, 20 February 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-=== A Review and Comparison of Various Surveys (subsection 2)===\n-\n-: Here is another analysis of the same question we are now discussing:\n-\n-:Jaroslaw Martyniuk: Letter to Ukrainian Weekly (re: Is an Orthodox Conflict Brewing in Ukraine?)\n-\n-:In his analysis \"Is an Orthodox conflict brewing in Ukraine?\" [published on April 14 by the Religious Information Service of Ukraine, and reproduced on April 17 by The Ukrainian Weekly, see above -UKL] Mr. Roman Kupchinsky writes that the largest branch of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine is \"by far\" the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP). He then proceeds to list the number of communities, monasteries and churches that each of the churches owns or controls. Based on those numbers he correctly concludes that the UOC-MP is the largest branch and the UOC-Kyiv Patriarchate is a distant second. While these facts are true they conflict head-on with survey results conducted by InterMedia and other organizations over the years. These surveys paint a completely different religious picture in Ukraine.\n-\n-:For example, in a 2003 nationwide survey (sample = 4,006 respondents over age 15) when respondents were asked . . . . \"Speaking about religious groups, which religious group do you consider yourself a member of or feel closest to? . . . the results showed that more than twice as many interviewees considered themselves members of or closer to the UOC-KP than the UOC-MP. The disparity between \"control of property\" and what people say is striking. The actual results show the following breakdown among various religious denominations in Ukraine:\n-\n-:Ukrainian Greek Catholic --8%\n-:Ukrainian Orthodox Church-KP --38%\n-:Ukrainian Orthodox Church- MP --16%\n-:Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church --2%\n-:Russian Orthodox Church --5%\n-:Roman Catholic --1%\n-:Protestant--1%\n-:Muslim--1%\n-:Jewish--0.1%\n-:Other--3%\n-:Do not feel close to any religion --20%\n-:D/K --5%\n-:Total =100%\n-\n-:Even if one includes those respondents that consider themselves as Russian Orthodox (5%) to those who consider themselves UOC-MP (16%) the resulting ratio is still almost two-to-one in favor of the UOC-KP. These numbers are not new (they have been reported in the RFE/RL Research Report and The Ukrainian Weekly) '''and the relationship has been remarkably consistent since the early nineties.'''\n-\n-:Unfortunately the mantra \"largest by far\" has been repeated so many times that observers get a distorted picture of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine. Of course there are some legitimate reasons for the differences-many respondents may attend UOC-MP churches because it's the only church in town, but their allegiance-when asked spontaneously in a face-to face an interview-is clearly with UOC-KP. Some responses may not be aware of the differences between the two Patriarchates but instinctively respond Kyiv Patriarchate, etc., but all that is a subject for another discussion.\n-:Jaroslaw Martyniuk Washington, D.C.

What I propose to do is as follows. We simply state in the article that surveys produce the unreliable results and are difficult to use to give any estimates within reasonable accuracy (I elaborated above why: divergence and confusion). We may further state that both churches are clearly leading all the rest by the number of adherents. We move all survey results, with explanations to the footnotes and may add in text that despite the divergence, some surveys suggest the advantage of KP (caveat, we do have to say that they are unreliable, see above). The number of parishes data is unquestionably reliable. It should be given as no one actually doubts these numbers. We may further add that there is a caveat here as well since small or large parish still counts as one and it is rather unreliable to infer the numbers of adherents from the numbers of the parishes. \n-\n-We do not change the order of the churches for now since when sections are swapped differences are harder to trace. I will read the proper chapter by Wilson this weekend and will let you know what I think. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 08:58, 2 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-=== A Review and Comparison of Various Surveys (Subsection 3)===\n-: I agree with your general recommendations.  However, I question your characterization of the survey results as unreliable (having designed and conducted research using surveys for my doctoral work I know a little bit about them).  Because the results are remarkably similiar across most surveys (as outlined by me, above), they are indeed [[Reliability (statistics)|reliable]].  For example, when you claimed that two of the surveys had wildly different results and added the numbers:\n-\n-:UOC - 37.8%, KP - 28.7%, UGCC - 18.6%  \n-\n-:UOC - 20.4%, KP - 30.1%, UGCC - 7.8%, UAOC - 1.5%   \n-\n-:You didn't take into account that the first one was based on total number of believers (about 40% of the population), while the second one was out of the total population.  So the numbers as you posted them were measuring two different things.  When I multiplied the numbers from the first survey by .4 (because only 40% of the population, according to the first survey, specified their belief), the results became quite consistent with respect to all the churches other than the UOC-KP and UOC (MP):\n-\n-:UOC - 15.1%, KP - 11.5%, UGCC - 7.44% (religious but no particular religion - 29%)\n-:UOC - 20.4%, KP - 30.1%, UGCC - 7.8%, UAOC - 1.5%  \n-\n-:This highlights that the problem with the survey results is limited only with respect to whether the OAC (MP) has more adherents than does the UOC-KP.  This probably reflects people's genuine attitudes (confusion about the two Orthodox Churches, being undecided, not caring about which Orthodox Church they belong to, not wishing to differentiate the two, etc.) rather than the surveys' poor reliability which after all show remarkably similar results for the UGCC.    \n-\n-:Three of the surveys, whose results are posted by Qe2, don't include \"no particular religion\" as an option.  These ones consistently show greater adherence to the UOC-KP than the UOC (MP).  This suggests that the UOC-KP indeed has more adherents.  A question arises with respect to the valdity of those three surveys, however.  Since we know that when given the option a relatively large number of people don't specify their Orthodoxy (in some casses, the unspecified is even larger than the number who proclaim their adherents to either of the two main Orthodox Churches!), how accurate are those surveys that fail to give as an option, no specific Orthodoxy?  This is not a question of reliability (the results of those three surveys are relatively consistent) but validity (how accurately do those consistant results really measure what they claim to measure - i.e., people's religious adherence).  I think the validity of the two surveys that don't include unspecified religion or Orthodoxy as an option is questionable, given the well-known number of people who when given that option don't specify their particular Orthodoxy.         \n-\n-:When the \"Modern Times\" section is rewritten, I recommend that we use one category, Orthodoxy, describe it as by far the largest religion in Ukraine.  Within this section we describe the three-way split within Orthodoxy and then include a brief discussion of survey data and parish data with limitations of each method of measurement.  With respect to surveys and adherents, it would read something like this: \"Most surveys show that more people identify themselves as belonging to the UOC - KP than to the UOC (MP).  However, such a high number of people do not specify their allegience to either of the two Church across most surveys that it is unclear from survey data which of the two main Orthodox Churches actually has the highest number of adherents.\"  I would also include the regional variation and impact on recent politics.  I would not state that the surveys are unreliable because they do indeed seem to be quite reliable.  The actual results or statistics of each survey can be put into footnotes.  Any information about specific Churches should then be placed under the appropriate subheadings (UOC-MP, UOC -KP, UAOC).  I am nuetral about whether the UOC-KP or the UOC (MP) should come first.  Given that the size of each Church isn't clear, perhaps it should be alphabetical.  [[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 15:23, 2 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-::To quickly reply to Faustian before I respond to Irpen at more length later, even if one looks at only the surveys that do include \"Orthodox of no particular jurisdiction\" as an option, the UOC-KP still receives a significantly and consistently greater percentage of responses. This might compare, for example, to surveys of U.S. voters which include Indpendent as a choice for party affiliation.  One might write, were Independents to show a larger number, that, for example, \"Democrats outnumber Republicans, but a sifnificant number of Independents exist\", but I do not believe that one would write \"it is unclear from survey data which of the two main political parties actually has the highest number of followers.\"  \n-\n-:::In your analogy, the question of which of the two main Orthodox Churches has more adherents is compared to predicting who would win the election in an essentially 2 party system like the the USA in surveys that ask for party membership.  \n-\n-::::Not \"who would win the election\", but simply \"party membership\"; just because there are many independents does not mean that the relative size of the parties cannot be compared.

My understanding is also that it is normal practice in statistics not to allow a single outlying result to redifine the conclusion; the data should, of course, be noted, but a single survey should not be overly weighted, especially one that was commissioned by one the interested parties. (My impression is that, although the UGCC did entrust the surveying to a reputable indepedent agency, it was the UGCC itself which decided to use the registered name \"UOC\" for the the \"UOC-MP\".  While their reasons may have been noble, this highlights one of the problems with surveys that are not entirely independent.  Then again, thanks to that survey, we can see that there do exist a significant number of people who consider themselves members of the UOC, but not the UOC-MP, which is, in itself, useful information.)\n-:::I explained above that this assertion is incorrect. The survey was conducted by the ''Ukrainian Sociological Service'', an independent polling orhanization, and UOC was actually called UOC-MP.

If one looks at the various sets of data regarding church sizes in the United States cited on the adherents.com website [http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html#bodies], one can see that all cited surveys, including those by the Pew Research Center, rank size of bodies from largest to smaller based upon those who express a preference.

[[User:Qe2|Qe2]] 19:12, 2 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-::Dear Irpen, Just because a number is accurate, does not mean it is useful.  Although I do not doubt that the data for the number or registered parishes is an accurate count of the number of registered parishes, and although I have no qualms about including that, or any other raw data, in the article, this data clearly does not correlate with the popular support for various churches.  Please look at the many, many articles found on, or linked to by, the adherents.com website [http://www.adherents.com]; please open any English-language almanac; in all cases, the number of adherents as measured in scientific surveys is the standard for church size.  Faustian has shown, at great length, that your concern with the innacuracy of the surveys (as well as KK's insistence that \"all surveys are useless) is not necessary.  All of the independent surveys taken over the past decade give fairly stable numbers for each church, and consistent relative size of all organizations.  Therefore, the article should present this information clearly, and should quote one or two representative samples.  There is no reason to discredit the survey data.  Any maps should be based on that data, as the visual information overweighs the written explanation. [[User:Qe2|Qe2]] 05:36, 5 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-First of all, your claim that [http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;2964/ this] survey that shows that UOC has more adherents than KP because UOC was called misleadingly is incorrect. In that survey, the respondents picked from the choices given to them as UOC-MP and UOC-KP. This is done ''despite'' UOC-MP is an incorrect name, strictly speaking, as the name of the church is just UOC, but this is a side question. Media use both names and survey questioners ''always'' use \"MP\" in the end for the sake of clarity. Trouble with survey is not that they are falsified or taken unscientifically (although the fact that one shows more for UOC(MP) and the other shows more for UOC-KP is alarming). The point is that ''the question is confusing'' and this is why people give different answers from survey to survey. I suggest we avoid stating which church has more adherents because bot number of parishes statistics and Survey statistics is unreliable ''in this case'' to infer the answer. Why number of Parishes cannot serve the base of number of adherents is obvious. The large parish can have more adherents than three small ones. The surveys also do not allow to draw any reliable conclusion as otherwise, we would not have different denominations leading from survey to survey. They do allow to estimate the number of Greek Catholics, because unlike the other numbers, their percentage is consistent. I tend to agree with Faustian that the reason is both lack of firm identification between different Orthodox branches (unlike between non-Orthodox and Orthodox), weak religiousity of a large number of people (still not weak enough to call themseves atheist) and that the questions are confusing for many. Remember my analogy above that inferring anything from a survey when the questions are simple and clear for everyone (What language do you use at home?) is much more meaningful than to infer anything from a much more politically charged and confusing question (Do you support Russian to become a second state language?) Same here, Greek Catholics and Orthodox can more or less firmly self-identify within branch. When it comes to which of the UOC's (remember there are more, like so called \"UAOC (canonical)\", the so called \"True Orthodox Church\" and whatever others) is much more confusing.[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 08:57, 5 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-::Sorry, I may have misinterpreted your earlier comments.

At present we need to decide what goes in the modern section and what does not. In my opinion things like church attendance and present rivalry as well as geographical support (down to the Oblast) should go into a new article called '''Religion in Ukraine''', with a see also from here and from [[Demographics in Ukraine]] this article instead should quickly summarise that data along the lines of, different surveys show different results... and so on...\n-The new article should also include things like Islam and Judaism in Ukraine and other religions should IMO go there, as this article primarily deals with religions that '''Ukrainians''' adhere to, not the different minorities that live there. So where its written ''majority of practicing Roman Catholics in Ukraine are the Polish minority'' does this belong here or there? \n-\n-WRT geographica distribution I have pulled an excellent source [http://www.derzhdeprelig.gov.ua/statystychnyi-zvit-2005.htm], now the link does not always work, but it does give the distribution among individual oblasts not in terms of parish numbers, but also in terms of clergy and church buildings (and categorises them like - those rented, those built in 1990-2005, those that are architectural heritage etc.) That can be used to make a good series of maps for the four major Ukrainian churches - UOC, UOC-KP, UAOC, UGCC, each with two one for numbers, the second for percentages. This is '''official''' state data! \n-\n-\n-==Another discussion on statistics==\n-:Dear KK, I am, believe it or not, truly glad that you are well.

A group of people who get together once a month in someone's flat can register a parish of some Protestant denomination and this will count at much towards the total number of parishes value as the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]] or [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]]. Number of churches, however, while imperfect, is very meaningful because it would include both the small and the large churches for both sides and the real buildings, unlike parishes, are less likely to be fictitious. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 20:08, 5 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-::::Please let us not forget that people in Ukraine have for many years been willing to attend a house of worship that was a part of church to which they did not belong.  There are many instances where the hierarchy have pushed clergy to support one church, or the local authorities have refused to re-assign a church, and one finds a village or town where a large portion, or even majority, of the worshippers at one church actually would prefer to be part of another church.  There are other places where people would be willing to build there own church, but have other needs.

Putting aside a group of people who are not very into those things and consider them \"just Orthodox\", the conscious choosers between the two churches can be symbolically divided into two groups, the, so to speak, \"nationally conscious\" (KK calls them \"svidomi\") and the \"religiously conscious\". Group one will be caught dead going into what they percieve as a \"Muscovite Imperialist Church\" and will go to whatever they have in their area that is \"purely Ukrainian, be it AO, KP or, perhaps even the so called \"AO (canonincal)\" of so called \"Metropolitan\" Moses (Kulyk). Those people put their national and political priorities above the religious ones. I take no position on that since my national and religious priorities are rather moderate. The other group, the \"religiously conscious\" ones, would be caught dead taking the [[Eucharist]] in the building which is (from the POV of the mainstream Orthodox Christianity) the \"Orthodox Church\" only by the officially registered name. Remember that from this POV (which I also neither endorse or condemn) the non-canonical organization cannot have anything to do with the Orthodoxy. As such, performing any rites there, starting from the regular ones (Eucharist) to a very special ones (Chritianization and wedding ceremony) has no meaning for the [[salvation]], [[sacrament]], [[repentance]], etc. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 19:54, 7 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-:On this topic, as I have, per your request and in the spirit of openness, refrained from making changes until we can establish a consensus.

Canonically of course none of these schismatic groups are recognised and of course the UOC(MP) is the heir, which is actually if you read the statements that they give to Yushenko's campaign of creating a united church: only after full return of seized property, and the redundance of Filaret will they agree to engage in dialogue.--[[User:Kuban kazak|Kuban Cossack]] 12:59, 7 March 2007 (UTC) \n-\n-::::::::::::::What you wrote about the vast majority of the ROC/UOC (MP) priests refusing to abandon their Church highlights the inherent institutional advantage enjoyed by the UOC (MP) and why the number of priests, like the amount of real estate, is far from an ideal indicator of religious adherence.  In terms of being canonical, is the UAOC canonical or not?  My understanding is that it is analogous to the ROCOR, except that unlike the ROCOR it has reentered the \"home country\" in opposition to the established Church.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 19:22, 7 March 2007 (UTC)     \n-:::::::::::::::That UAOC is non-canonical is not even in dispute by the UAOC itself. It does not satisfy ''any'' of the necessary criteria. Firstly, it has not [[Apostolic succession]] lineage as upon the church inception no ordained Bishop agreed to participate in the original formation of the church in 1921 and the priests \"Ordained\" their first leaders Met. Vasyl (Lypkivsky) and bishop Nestor (Stravynsky) in the non-recognized \"Alexandrian\" manner: by the laying-on of hands by priests. Secondly, the UAOC itself is currently walled off from the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]]. Besides, it is generally in a big mess with no clarity even on who is their first Hierarch. \n-\n-:::::::::::::::The Canadian and US respective churches, historically connected to the UAOC, but not organizationally connected to it right now in any way, are in a somewhat better shape as their are accepted by Constantinople ander its auspice. Even these churches raise questions and eyebrows together with the lack of full clarity about the general state of affairs with the Orthodoxy in North America. OCA, for one, which can make the best claim of being the \"local church\" in N.A. (pomestnaya tserkov') is in somewhat confusing relationship with Constantinople too about its status (although not the standing of the OC itself). There are various churches in N.A. under different European patriarchates which is not very helpful either as the canon calls for the local churches within each entity rather than Greeks, Russians, Ukrainians and Romanians in the US attending each their own churches under the non-American patriarch. \n-\n-:::::::::::::::As for ROCOR, it does have an apostolic succession as it was initiated by the Bishops of the ROC who were fully ordained and all further ordainments took place in the proper order. It is accepted by some, but not all, of the mainstream churches. Most importantly, in May of this year the official \"Act of Canonical Communion\" is scheduled which will restore the [[full communion]] between the ROCOR and the MP. It is still going to be confusing as within these two churches (and between them) the difference of opinions exist on whether this would make ROCOR a part of ROC (ROCOR tends to disagree) and the question of OCA rather than ROC being the North American local church is going to be inevitably raised at some point by OCA and it was already mentioned in the letter from OCA to ROCOR in connection with the planned in May event. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 20:29, 7 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-===Another discussion on statistics (section break)===\n-::but then again:[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/24441.htm The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), Moscow Patriarchate, is the '''largest single religious community''' and is the largest of the country's Orthodox Churches.

The examples that you have given from the UOC websites show that those UOC websites are not objective and thus, unless they use info that has been sourced elsewhere, are probably not trustworthy.  On the contrary, the surveys described on these talk pages, the CIA worldfactbook, Wilson's work, are pretty objective.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 19:57, 5 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-::::::::Nonetheless authentic photos seem to show otherwise...and its already published... and actually a number of Russian news agencies e.g. newsru.com use that website...which means that evidence is objective, which I place before ideology myself. Now like it or not, but I did quite a bit of statistics in university and I know, and mathematically can prove it to you why a census might be wrong, particularly wrt Irpen's comment above there is opposite correlation between the no. of churches and clergy (% wise) and the no. of followers according to some censuses. Call me a skeptic, but surveys, particularly with a sample size of 5000 is nowhere to be taken as accurate, not for a country of a population of 46 million. That is (roughly) 0.01% of the population... Which is not that hard to handpick if you got a time and resources... In my experience, and consult any professional mathematician, 1% is where a survey can be thought of as approaching accuracy. However hypothetically it is still possible to have a major source of error. As I did not see the original works and recordings of where each result came from, which regions...particularly since UOC-KP numbers jump from 20 to 50%... such surveys '''must''' be treated as only estimates, and potential forgery. Particularly in Ukraine, where there is also a major geographic distribution as well. You saw me manipulate the numbers for Kiev's data and the ratios we got there... Now I know this is bordering on Original research, however we have to apply a bit of common sense here. Only a census can give the results with no error. Unfortunately we do not have this. What we do have that is accurate is the register of churches, particularly those being built and the clergy serving in them. Now like that or not, that is an indicator and a strong one. You can disagree with that, but in that case provide sources that confirm this.

I feel that Ukraine should have its own Orthodox Church, just as do Bulgaria, Serbia, Russia, and every other Orthodox country.

I think that both of the competing Churches and their followers have been too mixed up with nationalism (Russian on the part of the UOC (MP) as your website shows, and Ukrainian with respect to UOC-KP involvement with UNA/UNSO).  If the choice were mine, it would be for Ukraine to have a united Ukrainian Patriarchate that was unconnected with Filaret and which would concentrate on spiritual rather than political matters.

Conducting such survey requires the domain knowledge on behalf of the takers, mainly to have a sufficiently representative group. I believe that Ukrainian Sociological Services is indeed a respectable institution but even they failed to produce any kind of convincing consistency. This is partly because they have likely failed to account for regional and other demographic differences (no matter how they tried) and partly because the question is much more difficult for an average Joe (or Taras) to answer than, say, \"Do you believe in god (yes, no, unsure)?\" --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 21:51, 5 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-Dear KK, you may choose to ignore the survey data if you wish, but the information should be clearly presented in the article so that people reading the article will have the same opportunity.

From what I have read in different analysis of churches that coexist in the certain terriotry, not only in UA, it is the number of parishes that's the most frequently mentioned factor in estimating their relative strength. Yes, there are US survey numbers for the number of baptists, episcopalians, etc, but much literature uses the naumbers of parishes. The reason probably is that the latter number is, while not always precisely, related to the number of adherents, and is much better known. It also may be that there are some sensitivities in conducting such surveys even in much more religiously stable areas than Ukraine. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 03:05, 8 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-:Another update: this is not really for an article as my personal observation do not count and I am not a survey taker. Just got off the phone with someone who lives in Eastern Ukraine's large city. Like most cities there, it is large Russophone and dominated by UOC. The person is not very much into politics and  attends the church but not very regularly. When she mentioned that, I got curious and asked, whose church is she now going to. She told me the name of the Saint to whom the Church is named. I then tried to find out whether it is UOC's or KP's church. I tried to ask in different ways and could not get the firm answer. I asked, Volodymyr's or Filaret's? In response I was given the name of the Saint to whom the Church is named. I tried to dig from another side and asked \"Russian or Ukrainian?\" The answer was \"Ukrainian, everything is now Ukrainian\" (the latter meaning not religion or language, but \"of Ukraine\", like even [[Party of Regions]] is a Ukrainian party despite most of them speak Russian.) Desperate I asked then \"Whose Patriarchate?\" She answered \"What?\". I had to ask a [[leading question]]. \"Moscow Patriarchate\" or \"Kiev Patriarchate\"? She immediately said \"Kiev\". And added, \"Kiev and Moscow are different now. Each of us now has its own borders\". Point is, that my respondent is totally apolitical. She lives in a Russophone city E.UA city and the chance is very strong that the church she goes to, as well as the majority of the churches there, are UOC. She was not able to tell me anything and when I finally asked \"Kiev or Moscow\", she said Kiev because she of course knows that she lives in Ukraine, Kiev is the capital of Ukraine while Moscow is Russia.\n-\n-:Perhaps, that's how the survey numbers show what they show. People actually don't know but when the question is \"Kiev or Moscow\", the person from Ukraine always answers \"Kiev\" unless s/he knows the subject.\n-\n-:As I said, I am not adding my original observations to the article.

In terms of being canonical, is the UAOC canonical or not?  My understanding is that it is analogous to the ROCOR, except that unlike the ROCOR it has reentered the \"home country\" in opposition to the established Church.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 19:22, 7 March 2007 (UTC)     \n-::That UAOC is non-canonical is not even in dispute by the UAOC itself. It does not satisfy ''any'' of the necessary criteria. Firstly, it has not [[Apostolic succession]] lineage as upon the church inception no ordained Bishop agreed to participate in the original formation of the church in 1921 and the priests \"Ordained\" their first leaders Met. Vasyl (Lypkivsky) and bishop Nestor (Stravynsky) in the non-recognized \"Alexandrian\" manner: by the laying-on of hands by priests. Secondly, the UAOC itself is currently walled off from the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]]. Besides, it is generally in a big mess with no clarity even on who is their first Hierarch. \n-\n-::The Canadian and US respective churches, historically connected to the UAOC, but not organizationally connected to it right now in any way, are in a somewhat better shape as their are accepted by Constantinople ander its auspice. Even these churches raise questions and eyebrows together with the lack of full clarity about the general state of affairs with the Orthodoxy in North America. OCA, for one, which can make the best claim of being the \"local church\" in N.A. (pomestnaya tserkov', perhaps \"national church\" is a better translation of this important term) is in somewhat confusing relationship with Constantinople too about its status (although not the standing of the OC itself). There are various churches in N.A. under different European patriarchates which is not very helpful either as the canon calls for the local churches within each entity rather than Greeks, Russians, Ukrainians and Romanians in the US attending each their own churches under the non-American patriarch. \n-\n-::As for ROCOR, it does have an apostolic succession as it was initiated by the Bishops of the ROC who were fully ordained and all further ordainments took place in the proper order. It is accepted by some, but not all, of the mainstream churches. Most importantly, in May of this year the official \"Act of Canonical Communion\" is scheduled which will restore the [[full communion]] between the ROCOR and the MP. It is still going to be confusing as within these two churches (and between them) the difference of opinions exist on whether this would make ROCOR a part of ROC (ROCOR tends to disagree) and the question will inevitebly be raised by the OCA the North American local church and some were  already mentioned in the letter from OCA to ROCOR in connection with the planned in May event. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 20:29, 7 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-:::Thank you for the info.  However according to wiki about the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] in 1924 when the Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory VII issued a tomos re-establishing the Kievan Rus-Ukrainian Metropolitan diocese as an Autocephalous Church. The responsibility of establishing a new Synod of Bishops was given to the Metropolitan-Archbishop of Warsaw, Dionisij (Waledynskyj) (the Polish Orthodox Church was basically made up mostly of ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusyns).  The UOAC Church abroad descends from those bishops and priests who fled Ukraine after World War II and who then merged witht he Ukrainian Orthodox Churches already there.  This story is told in the wiki entry on [[Patriarch Mstyslav (Stepan Skrypnyk)]], and the line of apostolic succession is [http://www.uaoc.org/en/history/apostolic.html here].  It seems to have indeed been canonical prior to World War II although its modern presence on Ukrainian soil is unapproved...[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] 21:19, 7 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-We should try to use better sources than the wiki itself. But anyway, here is what I know (or I think I know). The canonical status and recognition are two different (while related) things while the universal recognition usually signifies the full canonical status. [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] may choose to recognize someone or something but this by itself does not solve the whole host of problems. First of all, if Constantinope indeed \"granted\" Autocephaly to UAOC in 1924, this would have been very strange. Autocephaly may only be \"granted\" by the [[mother church]] and even this is not a instant solution of all the problems. Example: Constantinople tends to not recognize any Autocephaly or Autonomy of any church unless it is granted by Constantinople itself. The OCA status is an example of this strange state of affairs. Its status of the canonical body in the N.A. is not disputed but some patriarchates including the  Constantinople do not recognize its self-governing status. See [http://www.oca.org/QAindex.asp?SID=3 this] for more. Does it mean that they consider it part of ROC? The clear answer to this question is very difficult to find. \n-\n-So, we would really have to find out what was there in that Tomos and whether the statement mentioned there was an official statement by Constantinople or the opinion of one of its Bishops. It is easy to confuse the two. For example there is frequently cited in press confusion that Constantinople \"does not recognize\" UOC under the MP or other similar unclear nonsense. They are all based on a whimsical interview given at one point of time by one Bishop under the Constantinople, the Archbishop Vsevolod (Maydansky) who is actually with the UOC of the USA (a spin-off from UAOC accepted by Constantinople). As for the official position of the EP, there is nothing more clear than the statement of the [[Patriarch Bartholomew I]] where he says that Filaret is not consider a church hierarch by anyone in the Orthodoxy. Also note that even Vsevolod, as well as any other supreme bishops, accept the clerics of the KP into the Orthodox church only through a \"repentance\" procedure. Bear in mind that [[schism]] in Eastern Orthodoxy is considered a crime.\n-\n-Now, the reality is of course affected by politics. As decades or sometimes centuries pass the facts on the ground affect the actions of the hierarchs of the established churches as well as the status of the \"relatively new\" churches. This has not happened here yet and is nowhere in sight either for KP or for UAOC whose position is better in some respects and worse in some others. An established historic tradition (UAOC is almost 100 years old), the de-facto legacy in some territories and partial recognition of its spin-offs helps UAOC somewhat. The mess it is currently in hurts it about as much. Firm state support and nationalist rhetoric helps KP in some respect but the total lack of recognition hurts it, perhaps, more or at least as much.\n-\n-The keys from this mess is of course in Moscow right now. The day MP decides to grant a full autocephaly to UOC from its current autonomous status would effectively end any meaningful position of Filaret, his KP and UAOC. From the canonical standpoint Ukraine already has a \"local church\" (pomestnaya tserkov') which is nothing else but the Volodymyr's UOC and no one can seriously dispute that. Its lack of full autocephaly, its involvement in politics being comparable to that of KP's involvement as well as many other political struggles allow to politicize the religious debate and boost the claims of other churches. However, Moscow is understandably not eager to do such step as after this there would be no return and the centuries old churches have to think from the perspective of longer than a decade or two. It may seem to them that the current set of events with Ukraine's becoming more and more independent from Russia is not assured to be an eternal change. Some hundreds years ago this already has happened and yet reversed. Position of myself, Faustian, QE2, KK and even Jimbo Wales in respect to this is irrelevant. Certainly the last parliamentary election has likely raised some hopes in Moscow, not necessarily about the \"re-unification\" but about the overall trends. So, Moscow would be in no rush to grant autocephaly and this disarray will continue, at least for some time, unless it is solved by an unexpected and miraculous change. But, hey, this is religion! So miracles may happen, you know. Isn't miracle a synonym of the \"act of God\"? --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 22:25, 7 March 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-:P.S. It would be interesting to find out whether the Ukrainian bishops in the US and Canada were RE-ordained or not when their churches were received by Constantinople (in the 1990s). The latter would imply that their hierarchical status was accepted as it was and the former would clearly mean that even Constantinople saw their churches outside of the Communion prior to receiving them.\n-\n-:To remind you, this event  caused the significant rift within the Ukrainian church in the US. Some parishes decided to move under Filaret's KP. Later, some of them chose to revert and when they turned again to UOC/USA the  Archbishop Vsevolod (Maydansky) of UOC/USA only received those clerics back through a canonical procedure of repentance and re-ordainment.

Also a refrence for the eulogy being in Russian would be helpful. --[[User:Kuban kazak|Kuban Cossack]] 12:25, 20 November 2007 (UTC)\n-\n-\n-The Ukrainian Orthodox church and Ukrainian Catholic church maintain their own specific ritual forms in celebrating the Divine Liturgy. These are particularly evident when compared to the liturgical norms of the Russian Orthodox church. The priest in a Ukrainian church traditionally reads the Gospel facing the congregation, while in the Russian church he is turned away from them; moreover, the Ukrainian priest keeps the Royal Gates of the iconostasis open considerably longer than does the Russian. After the subjugation of the Ukrainian Orthodox to the Russian Orthodox church in the 18th century, numerous Russian elements were introduced into the liturgy in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox church that emerged after 1917 reformed the liturgy (including abbreviations) and revived many old Ukrainian traditions. These traditions are now observed by Ukrainian Orthodox jurisdictions in the West, but the Orthodox church under the Moscow patriarch retains the Russian elements.\n-\n-In the 17th century, sermons were delivered in bookish Belarusian-Ukrainian combined with vernacular elements. Both the Orthodox and Uniate churches placed much emphasis on the clarity of sermons. Sermons were usually preached after the reading of the Gospel in Uniate churches, while Orthodox priests as a rule delivered their sermons at the end of the Divine Liturgy. \n-\n-When in the late 17th century the Ukrainian Orthodox church came under the control of Moscow, the hitherto common homiletical practices of the Orthodox and Uniate churches began to diverge. \n-\n-As a result of systematic Russification, homiletics in the Ukrainian language progressively declined in the 19th century. \n-\n-In the Ukrainian Catholic church, the 18th century saw the continuation of developments of the previous century, and the Ukrainian bookish, and later the vernacular, language replaced Church Slavonic in homiletics. The Russian authorities persecuted, and by 1830 abolished, the Ukrainian Catholic church in the territory under their control. That church continued its legal existence only in Austrian-ruled Western Ukraine. \n-\n-At the turn of the 19th century the clergy in Western Ukraine began using the vernacular in their sermons and publications. Sermons were published in the vernacular by Mykhailo Luchkai (2 vols, 1831), T. Vytvytsky (2 vols, 1847), and Antin Dobriansky (1850) and in supplements to such newspapers as Zoria halytska (1853–4). \n-\n-The Ukrainian Orthodox church was restored under the Ukrainian National Republic in 1917 and survived in Soviet Ukraine until the early 1930s. During this time homiletics was fostered by the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox church (UAOC). From the 1930s sermons in Soviet Ukraine were delivered mostly in Russian (except in the Western Ukrainian regions annexed in 1944).\n-\n-Homiletics has developed normally outside the Soviet bloc within all the Ukrainian churches.\n-\n-[[User:Bandurist|Bandurist]] ([[User talk:Bandurist|talk]]) 17:15, 20 November 2007 (UTC)\n-:You are forgetting one thing, that after 1917 and the establishment of the Ukrainian Exarchate all eulogy in rural Ukrainian speaking areas was read in Ukrainian, even today the UOC(MP) reads its eulogy in Ukrainian (except those where the faithfull are Russophone). However to actually read liturgy in Ukrainian, is something that was seen only in ex-Uniate parishes in western Ukraine. Elsewhere it was Church slavonic. This is much more unique. --[[User:Kuban kazak|Kuban Cossack]] 12:29, 26 November 2007 (UTC)\n-\n == Persecution of Greek Catholic Ukrainians in Kholm ==\n \n I find it ironic that someone, who wrote a nice article on forceful conversion to Orthodoxy of the Kholm Governorate should be reverting a statement describing discrimination and persecution of Catholic Ukrainians in that area.

To reiterate the case for the MP, surveys suggest more adherents for the KP but are flawed due to the people's seeming confusion (see the lengthy discussion in the archives here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:History_of_Christianity_in_Ukraine/Archive04#A_Review_and_Comparison_of_Various_Surveys]).  For example, in one survey (Mott Foundation, 2000 - the most recent one) the MP has 12%, KP 22%, and '''\"Orthodox No Particular Affiliation\" has 26%'''. The CIA Worldfactbook cites MP 9%, KP 19%, and Orthodox unspecified 16%. This phenomenon is seen in every survey.  For this reason, we can't say that the survey states that the KP actually has more adherents.  It's suggested, but not concluded and making such a conclusion is original research. All we can say is that more people explictly state that they belong to the KP than explicitly claim to belong to the MP.  This is not the same as more adherents.  It could mean that KP people are more activistic and self-aware.  It could mean that people living in areas with no choice (MP territory in eastern Ukraine with few KP churches) just say \"Orthodox\" without specifying.  If you live in Donetsk and every church is a MP Church you might just say \"Orthodox\" without specifying; but if you live in Kiev where on one corner is a KP Church and on another an MP Church you might be more likely to give a specific answer.  We don't know why more people endorse KP than MP and we can't base edits on our speculation because it's original research.  All we can say is which one has more self-declared adherents, in the context of more people giving a vague answer than giving a specific one and that '''the number of self-declared adherents is still under 50% of Orthodox adherents.''' So the survey data doesn't tell us which Church has more actual adherents, though it tells us whose adherents are more self-aware.  On the other hand, number of priests, number of parishes, and number of churches are not subject ot speculation or interpretation.  They are facts, and the MP has something like a 3 to 1 advantage in that area over the KP.  So let's summarize what the actual facts are without any speculation:\n+\n+:* MP has more than three times the churches, monasteries, priests and parishes than the KP has. See [http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/orthodox.mp/] and [http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/orthodox.kp/].  It also has more of the most important religious cites such as the Pecherska Lavra.\n+\n+:* According to most surveys, a huge portion of Orthodox don't identify which Church they belong to (in some surveys it's the largest simgle group, in others it's within 5% of the top). Among those who do identify it, however, more identify themselves as belonging to the KP than the MP by a large margin.  In each survey, however, '''the self-identified KP adherents still make up less than 50% of Orthodox Christians''' due to the large number with no expressed preference.\n+\n+:These are the facts and the placement should be based on them.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 06:10, 1 February 2009 (UTC)\n \n ==Article improvment==\n "}

First, I will address the questions regarding the survey data.  \n+\n+1. Regarding the survey commissioned by the UGCC, while I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the UGCC or the professional ability of the Ukrainian Sociological Survey, this survey is unusual in that, at the request of the UGCC, the choices given were \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate\" or \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church\"; \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)\" was not an option.  I believe that it can be inferred from this, if considered in comparison with other surveys, is that there are Ukrainians who would consider themselves followers of THE \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church\", but not of the \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church under the Moscow Patriarchate\".    I suspect that the UGCC simply wanted to be cautiously respectful to the UOC(MP) and used their legal name.  While I see nothing wrong with discussing this, or citing it, as long the difference is noted, I do not think this survey would fall in the category of \"independent\" surveys cited by Bandurist, as the UGCC had too much input in designing this question.  \n+\n+2.  In any survey of religious self-profession, there will be a larger number of \"nones\" if the survey uses a two-step process (asking first if the people belong to a certain church, and then asking which church) then with a one-step process (just asking people which church, possibly with \"none of the above\" or \"other\" as alternatives).  This is true everywhere, and not unique to Ukraine.  Dr. Brian Grim of the Pew Forum published an example showing how, in Bulgaria,  the number of 'nones' were more than 7 times higher when using a two step survey process compared with a one step process, among the exact same population.  The fact that many people will, in some surveys, give an answer like \"Orthodox of no jurisdiction\" does not mean that the relative size data is not accurate.  \n+\n+Regarding ranking church strength based on number of registered parishes or clergy, there are a number of flaws which would seem to make this inherently unreliable.  For example:\n+\n+1.  The allocation of church buildings in Ukraine is decided in the first instance by local authorities, and is therefore subject to influence outside of the local congregations.  For example, in a case decided on June 14, 2007 and cited in the U.S. State Department's International Religious Freedom Report (2007), the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Kyiv city administration was violating the rights of the faithful of the Svyato-Mykhaylivska parish by not allowing them to reregister from the UOC-MP to the UOC-KP. That is, the faithful of that parish overwhelmingly wish to be a part of the UOC-KP, but the civil authorities force their church (and its priest) to remain in the UOC-MP.   In fact, even though a survey in December of 2006 showed that 52% of the adults in Kyiv suported the Kyivan Patriarchate, compared to only 8% for the Moscow Patriarchate, the Kyiv City Council that same year granted Moscow title to 10 churches and only 1 to the Kyivan Patriarchate.  There is evidence here and elsewhere that the number of faithful does not, at least in places, correlate with the number of parishes.\n+\n+2.  Legally, all that is required to register a parish in Ukraine are the signatures of 10 adult citizens.  There is therefore clearly at least an opportunity to inflate the number of parishes by registering \"paper parishes\".\n+\n+3.  As elsewhere in the world, parishes vary in size and commitment. I believe that there are actually more registered Protestant parishes and clergy than for the UGCC, yet I do not believe that anyone would claim that there are more Protestant faithful than Greek Catholic in Ukraine.\n+\n+4.  In terms of possession of buildings and clergy, the UOC-MP in most places became the 'de facto' inheritor of the Russian Orthodox Church, which was the only church legally tolerated throughout most of the Soviet Era.  \n+\n+Given the inherent problems with basing church strength on a secondary figure like number of parishes or clergy, and given the consistency of multiple sets of scientific survey data, there seems to be no clear reason to consider using parish size or number of clergy as an exception in this case.

The second and third reasons are probably related.  The contra - number of adherents - invovles survey data whose flaws have been discussed at length.

However that does not translate to dominance in Ukraine. Certainly there is a schism in Ukrainian orthodoxy, part oriented toward those ties with Moscow, part seeing any such ties as an incarnation of Russian imperialism--Ukrainian orthodoxy, as I understand it, currently allied with the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), Kiev Patriarchate (UOC-KP), and there is an additional autonomous Ukrainian variant (UAOC). Clouding today's preferences is that during the Soviet era the autonomous Ukrainian church was coerced to recognize Moscow as the central authority. (Its persecutions and resurrections during the Soviet era being another topic.) Even so, the Ukrainian Church under Moscow today constitutes a minority of Ukrainian orthodox believers. IMHO, perhaps if Moscow un-excommunicated Ivan Mazepa--originally excommunicated for violating his loyalty oath to Peter the Great--it might garner more believers that it is not (still) an instrument of central Russian policy. I certainly see no objective reasons to place the Moscow Patriarchate first, nor is putting Ukrainian orthodoxy first pandering to nationalists. The numbers are what they are.

Regarding the survey commissioned by the UGCC, while I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the UGCC or the professional ability of the Ukrainian Sociological Survey, this survey is unusual in that, at the request of the UGCC, the choices given were \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate\" or \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church\"; \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)\" was not an option.

I suspect that the UGCC simply wanted to be cautiously respectful to the UOC(MP) and used their legal name.  While I see nothing wrong with discussing this, or citing it, as long the difference is noted, I do not think this survey would fall in the category of \"independent\" surveys cited by Bandurist, as the UGCC had too much input in designing this question.  \n+1.

In any survey of religious self-profession, there will be a larger number of \"nones\" if the survey uses a two-step process (asking first if the people belong to a certain church, and then asking which church) then with a one-step process (just asking people which church, possibly with \"none of the above\" or \"other\" as alternatives).  This is true everywhere, and not unique to Ukraine.  Dr. Brian Grim of the Pew Forum published an example showing how, in Bulgaria,  the number of 'nones' were more than 7 times higher when using a two step survey process compared with a one step process, among the exact same population.  The fact that many people will, in some surveys, give an answer like \"Orthodox of no jurisdiction\" does not mean that the relative size data is not accurate.  \n \n@@ -189,3 +190,7 @@\n ::::::I think that the situation is similar here - if the majority of faithful decide to acknowledge adherence to one Patriarchate, they will hold the \"swing vote\".

For example, in one survey (Mott Foundation, 2000 - the most recent one) the MP has 12%, KP 22%, and '''\"Orthodox No Particular Affiliation\" has 26%'''. The CIA Worldfactbook cites MP 9%, KP 19%, and Orthodox unspecified 16%. This phenomenon is seen in every survey.  For this reason, we can't say that the survey states that the KP actually has more adherents.  It's suggested, but not concluded and making such a conclusion is original research. All we can say is that more people explictly state that they belong to the KP than explicitly claim to belong to the MP.  This is not the same as more adherents.  It could mean that KP people are more activistic and self-aware.  It could mean that people living in areas with no choice (MP territory in eastern Ukraine with few KP churches) just say \"Orthodox\" without specifying.  If you live in Donetsk and every church is a MP Church you might just say \"Orthodox\" without specifying; but if you live in Kiev where on one corner is a KP Church and on another an MP Church you might be more likely to give a specific answer.  We don't know why more people endorse KP than MP and we can't base edits on our speculation because it's original research.  All we can say is which one has more self-declared adherents, in the context of more people giving a vague answer than giving a specific one and that '''the number of self-declared adherents is still under 50% of Orthodox adherents.''' So the survey data doesn't tell us which Church has more actual adherents, though it tells us whose adherents are more self-aware.  On the other hand, number of priests, number of parishes, and number of churches are not subject to speculation or interpretation.  They are facts, and the MP has something like a 3 to 1 advantage in that area over the KP.  So let's summarize what the actual facts are without any speculation:\n \n :* MP has more than three times the churches, monasteries, priests and parishes than the KP has. See [http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/orthodox.mp/] and [http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/orthodox.kp/].  It also has more of the most important religious cites such as the Pecherska Lavra.\n@@ -163,7 +163,7 @@\n :: Perfectly appropriate to have a discussion section so as to not make the voting section too thick with discussion.

Unfortunately, the survey results don't support that - they only indicate that for whatever reason more people explicitly state that they belong to the KP than the MP, the number of explicit KP supporters still being below 50% of Orthodox Christians.  Let's look at the results of one survey, the mostr recent one from the Mott Foundation in 2000, which showed that the MP has 12%, KP 22%, and \"Orthodox No Particular Affiliation\" has 26% support, Ukrainian Autocephalous 1%.

Even though sources from Russian orthodox church site Iith respect to the persecutions, a solution might be to qualify the referenced statement - \"according to...\" and then include the info on persecutions. However this brings up another problem with the particular reference.  The info doesn't come from, say, the Ukrainian Catholic Church's website but from one parish's web page.  Adding \"according to St. Mary's Church in Winnipeg persecutions etc. occurred\" isn't right.\n\n:About Subtleny's boook - are you sure that Subtelny was referring specifically to the persecutions etc. in Chelm?  I might be wrong and wil check again, but Subtleny didn't seem to write much about Chelm (I think I looked when I worte the article).  On the other hand Himka seemed to present the situation in Chelm as generally calm and free of persecution until the 1860's.  I won't revert until I double-check, but the sentence \"Within the Russian Empire, the Uniate Church - despite mass deportations, persecutions and discrimination - continued to function until 1875, when the Eparchy of [[Chełm|Chelm]] was [[Conversion of Chelm Eparchy|abolished]].\" implies that the deportations were happening in Chelm, which might not be accurate.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]])\n::Let me cite from Subtelny: ''By means of mass deportations, bribery and even executions Bibikov succeeded in practically eliminating the Greek Catholic Church in the empire.'' Please, do check it on p. 211. In this article we are talking about the Greek Catholic Church as such. That's what the paragraph means. And mass deportations, executions and general persecution of Greek Catholics happened throughout the empire, including the Kholm Governorate if you are interested. --[[User:Hillock65|Hillock65]] ([[User talk:Hillock65|talk]]) 04:54, 24 October 2008 (UTC)\n:::On the top of the page it states that Bibikov was in charge of Kiev, Podolia and Volhynia provinces.  The persecutions etc. refers to those regions specifically (Subtelny also adds Belarus).

Neither the whole of it, or the section, or even that particular sentence restricts the subject to Kholm governorate. It states, and correctly so, that the Greek Catholics were persecuted by Russian authorities in the empire. It, and neither in fact Subtelny mention if that happened in that particular Governorate. It happened in the empire to all Catholics and the sentence correctly reflects that. Whether that happened in KG is left out and does not seem to be that relevant in relation to general persecution in the empire. --[[User:Hillock65|Hillock65]] ([[User talk:Hillock65|talk]]) 05:19, 24 October 2008 (UTC)\n\n== GA/A class ==\n\nSince this article has seen quite an input from numerous users a suggestion to upgrade it to class A or GA?

For example, in analyzing an earlier set of surveys,\nhistorian Andrew Wilson writes, in \"The Ukrainians: Unexpected Nation\"\n(Yale University Press, 2002: pp 236-237):\n\n\"...According to the largest and most comprehensive poll\nundertaken in 1997, 65.7% of the sample considered\nthemselves believers, and of these 62.5% expressed an\nallegiance to particular Church. Of the latter, 12.3%\ndeclared themselves supporters of the UOC-MP and\na further 11.6% claimed to belong to the Russian\nOrthodox Church, although technically it no longer\nexists in Ukraine (its supporters can basically be\ngrouped with those of the Moscow Patriarchate). An\nimpressive 43% named the UOC-KP, and only 4% the\nAutocephalous Orthodox. Greek Catholics accounted for\n14.3%, concentrated overwhelmingly in the western\nregions of Galicia and Transcarpathia.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Wilson's footnotes, the above figures are from a 1997\nSocis-Gallup poll. Dr. Wilson adds, on page 361:\n\n\"According to another Sosis-Gallup poll in February 1998,\n41% claimed no religion, 20.4% backed the UOC-KP, 7.5%\nthe UOC-MP, 1.8% the UAOC and 6.3% the Greek\nCatholics...\"\n\n\nThe fact that, despite the availability of objective data such as the above, the Moscow Patriarchate continues to claim to represent almost\n70% of the Ukrainian population, would suggest that the claims provided by Moscow are extremely doubtful.\n\n[[User:Bandurist|Bandurist]] ([[User talk:Bandurist|talk]]) 16:47, 28 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n*Thank you for posting these.

[[User:Qe2|Qe2]] ([[User talk:Qe2|talk]]) 16:59, 1 February 2009 (UTC)\n\n:I feel that changes should be made to reflect the information that I put forward. Is there anything reliable that that opposes this information? Previously I tried to incorporate some of these statistics and only got it all removed. I am worried not to start up a conflict. \n\n: I do think that the UOC Kyiv patriarchy should be listed first for a number of reasons. 1) It has more parishioners, 2) It is not subservient toa foreign patriarch, 3) Th UOC Moscow Patrircrchy was previously known only as the Russioan Orthof\\dox Church and only recently changed its name. I remember proof reading a book published by the [[Ukraina Society]] in 1988. At that time the UOC MP was known in Ukraina as the Rus' Orthodox church. However when translated into English Rus' Orthodox church was transformed into Russian Orthodox church. Despite my opposition to the translation that is how they published it.[[User:Bandurist|Bandurist]] ([[User talk:Bandurist|talk]]) 15:53, 31 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n\n::The counterarguments are that the UOC-MP is the only one recognized by the international Orthodox community, it is the \"default\" Church (the one that was the only one outside Galicia since the 1930's, and the one that dominated Ukraine from c. 1680), and has overwhelmingly the largest infrastructure (most parishes, most church buildings, most priests).  The second and third reasons are probably related.  The contra - number of adherents - invovles survey data whose flaws have been discussed at length.  The surveys suggest more adherents for the KP - perhaps even strongly suggest - but is this enough to override the reasons to place the UOC-MP first?  I suggest a vote before we make any changes, in order to have some sort of consensus.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 18:26, 31 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::I do not believe that the fact that \"the UOC-MP is the only one recognized by the international Orthodox community\" should be considered as a standard for an encyclopedia article, as that criterium is weighted from the POV of one group of people. The article should state this fact clearly, as it does, but it really does not seem to me that it can be neutrally argued that this should be a reason for automatically giving the UOC-MP top billing.  For the same logic, I would disagree with Bandurist's Reason #2; if the UOC-MP did have more adherants today, it should come first. (Hence, I would agree with his #1, and regret that I am not sure that I understand #3 exactly.)  [[User:Qe2|Qe2]] ([[User talk:Qe2|talk]]) 16:59, 1 February 2009 (UTC)\n\n\nMakes sense. It is better to get some sense of re opinions before making changes that have a tendency of escalating matters.22:26, 31 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n===Vote on placing UOC KP before UOC MP ===\nCurrently in the article we have UOC MP before UOC KP. This gives a distorted picture. Currently the UOC KP has more parishioners. I am calling a vote in order to see opinions regarding placement of UOC KP before UOC MP in the Lead.\n\n* '''Support''' - I believe that the UOC KP should be placed before the UOC MP because there it has more adherants, in fact its share of the religious pie is now greater.

However that does not translate to dominance in Ukraine. Certainly there is a schism in Ukrainian orthodoxy, part oriented toward those ties with Moscow, part seeing any such ties as an incarnation of Russian imperialism--Ukrainian orthodoxy, as I understand it, currently allied with the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), Kiev Patriarchate (UOC-KP), and there is an additional autonomous Ukrainian variant (UAOC). Clouding today's preferences is that during the Soviet era the autonomous Ukrainian church was coerced to recognize Moscow as the central authority. (Its persecutions and resurrections during the Soviet era being another topic.) Even so, the Ukrainian Church under Moscow today constitutes a minority of Ukrainian orthodox believers. IMHO, perhaps if Moscow un-excommunicated Ivan Mazepa--originally excommunicated for violating his loyalty oath to Peter the Great--it might garner more believers that it is not (still) an instrument of central Russian policy. I certainly see no objective reasons to place the Moscow Patriarchate first, nor is putting Ukrainian orthodoxy first pandering to nationalists. The numbers are what they are.

To reiterate the case for the MP, surveys suggest more adherents for the KP but are flawed due to the people's seeming confusion (see the lengthy discussion in the archives here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:History_of_Christianity_in_Ukraine/Archive04#A_Review_and_Comparison_of_Various_Surveys]).  For example, in one survey (Mott Foundation, 2000 - the most recent one) the MP has 12%, KP 22%, and '''\"Orthodox No Particular Affiliation\" has 26%'''. The CIA Worldfactbook cites MP 9%, KP 19%, and Orthodox unspecified 16%. This phenomenon is seen in every survey.  For this reason, we can't say that the survey states that the KP actually has more adherents.  It's suggested, but not concluded and making such a conclusion is original research. All we can say is that more people explictly state that they belong to the KP than explicitly claim to belong to the MP.  This is not the same as more adherents.  It could mean that KP people are more activistic and self-aware.  It could mean that people living in areas with no choice (MP territory in eastern Ukraine with few KP churches) just say \"Orthodox\" without specifying.  If you live in Donetsk and every church is a MP Church you might just say \"Orthodox\" without specifying; but if you live in Kiev where on one corner is a KP Church and on another an MP Church you might be more likely to give a specific answer.  We don't know why more people endorse KP than MP and we can't base edits on our speculation because it's original research.  All we can say is which one has more self-declared adherents, in the context of more people giving a vague answer than giving a specific one and that '''the number of self-declared adherents is still under 50% of Orthodox adherents.''' So the survey data doesn't tell us which Church has more actual adherents, though it tells us whose adherents are more self-aware.  On the other hand, number of priests, number of parishes, and number of churches are not subject to speculation or interpretation.  They are facts, and the MP has something like a 3 to 1 advantage in that area over the KP.  So let's summarize what the actual facts are without any speculation:\n\n:* MP has more than three times the churches, monasteries, priests and parishes than the KP has. See [http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/orthodox.mp/] and [http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/orthodox.kp/].  It also has more of the most important religious cites such as the Pecherska Lavra.\n\n:* According to most surveys, a huge portion of Orthodox don't identify which Church they belong to (in some surveys it's the largest simgle group, in others it's within 5% of the top). Among those who do identify it, however, more identify themselves as belonging to the KP than the MP by a large margin.  In each survey, however, '''the self-identified KP adherents still make up less than 50% of Orthodox Christians''' due to the large number with no expressed preference.\n\n:These are the facts and the placement should be based on them.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 06:10, 1 February 2009 (UTC)\n\n*Support - the facts are simple - more people identify themselves as members of the Kyiv Pariarchate than the Moscow Patriarchate. \nYes, there is a large part of people who do not identify with either Patriarchate, but there is no reason to assume that they would be divided any differently than those who do make a distinction. I think that in this kind of situation, their impartiality eliminates them from the decision-making process. \nWe should focus on the facts that are clear - of the people who do choose a Patriarchate, more support the Kyiv Patriarchate, therefore that should be stated first.\n\nAlso, all other statistics being equal, alphabetically Kyiv is before Moscow, so it should come first.\nThanks, [[User:Horlo|Horlo]] ([[User talk:Horlo|talk]]) 09:23, 1 February 2009 (UTC)\n\n::Actually there is reason to assume they would choose the MP, because the MP territory is monolithic (I.e., in Donetsk almost every church is an MP church, so someone from there, a member of an MP church, would be more likely to simply call themselves Orthodox without bothering to specify).  As I said, the statistics say that more people identify themsevles as KP than MP.  They do NOT say that most people belong to the KP.  There is a big difference there.[[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 17:20, 1 February 2009 (UTC)\n\n* '''Support''' - Ranking according to number of adherents is an objective standard. (I intend to follow Faustian's comments in a separate section.) [[User:Qe2|Qe2]] ([[User talk:Qe2|talk]]) 15:45, 1 February 2009 (UTC)\n\n==Article improvment==\n\nI think that this article can be good or featured just with more references. --[[user:vojvodaen|Vojvodae]][http://istorijska-biblioteka.wikidot.com/start ist] 14:23, 31 January 2009 (UTC)\n\n==Comments on Voting==\n\nI apologize if it is innapropriate to start a subheading for this discussion, but I wished to address some of the points raised by Faustian in the voting section in a greater detail than I thought appropriate at that place.   First, I will address the questions regarding the survey data.  \n\n1. Regarding the survey commissioned by the UGCC, while I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the UGCC or the professional ability of the Ukrainian Sociological Survey, this survey is unusual in that, at the request of the UGCC, the choices given were \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate\" or \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church\"; \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)\" was not an option.  I believe that it can be inferred from this, if considered in comparison with other surveys, is that there are Ukrainians who would consider themselves followers of THE \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church\", but not of the \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church under the Moscow Patriarchate\".    I suspect that the UGCC simply wanted to be cautiously respectful to the UOC(MP) and used their legal name.  While I see nothing wrong with discussing this, or citing it, as long the difference is \nnoted, I do not think this survey would fall in the category of \"independent\" surveys cited by Bandurist, as the UGCC had too much input in designing this question.  \n\n2.  In any survey of religious self-profession, there will be a larger number of \"nones\" if the survey uses a two-step process (asking first if the people belong to a certain church, and then asking which church) then with a one-step process (just asking people which church, possibly with \"none of the above\" or \"other\" as alternatives).  This is true everywhere, and not unique to Ukraine.  Dr. Brian Grim of the Pew Forum published an example showing how, in Bulgaria,  the number of 'nones' were more than 7 times higher when using a two step survey process compared with a one step process, among the exact same population.  The fact that many people will, in some surveys, give an answer like \"Orthodox of no jurisdiction\" does not mean that the relative size data is not accurate.  \n\nRegarding ranking church strength based on number of registered parishes or clergy, there are a number of flaws which would seem to make this inherently unreliable.  For example:\n\n1.  The allocation of church buildings in Ukraine is decided in the first instance by local authorities, and is therefore subject to influence outside of the local congregations.  For example, in a case decided on June 14, 2007 and cited in the U.S. State Department's International Religious Freedom Report (2007), the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Kyiv city administration was violating the rights of the faithful of the Svyato-Mykhaylivska parish by not allowing them to reregister from the UOC-MP to the UOC-KP. That is, the faithful of that parish overwhelmingly wish to be a part of the UOC-KP, but the civil authorities force their church (and its priest) to remain in the UOC-MP.   In fact, even though a survey in December of 2006 showed that 52% of the adults in Kyiv suported the Kyivan Patriarchate, compared to only 8% for the Moscow Patriarchate, the Kyiv City Council that same year granted Moscow title to 10 churches and only 1 to the Kyivan Patriarchate.  There is evidence here and elsewhere that the number of faithful does not, at least in places, correlate with the number of parishes.\n\n2.  Legally, all that is required to register a parish in Ukraine are the signatures of 10 adult citizens.  There is therefore clearly at least an opportunity to inflate the number of parishes by registering \"paper parishes\".\n\n3.  As elsewhere in the world, parishes vary in size and commitment. I believe that there are actually more registered Protestant parishes and clergy than for the UGCC, yet I do not believe that anyone would claim that there are more Protestant faithful than Greek Catholic in Ukraine.\n\n4.  In terms of possession of buildings and clergy, the UOC-MP in most places became the 'de facto' inheritor of the Russian Orthodox Church, which was the only church legally tolerated throughout most of the Soviet Era.  \n\nGiven the inherent problems with basing church strength on a secondary figure like number of parishes or clergy, and given the consistency of multiple sets of scientific survey data, there seems to be no clear reason to consider using parish size or number of clergy as an exception in this case. [[User:Qe2|Qe2]] ([[User talk:Qe2|talk]]) 16:32, 1 February 2009 (UTC)\n\n:I apologize for following my own post with yet another, but I think I see that Faustian is making a distinction between, on one hand, number of \"adherants\" and, on the other hand, number of \"followers\" or \"self-declared adherents\".  I sincerely apologize that, probably in my ignorance, I am not certain I understand this difference, and would be grateful if someone could patiently explain to me the significance of this distintion.

To paraphrase some of the points above...\n::* Size of infrastructure and numbers of support personnel is not a measure of customer base.\n::* Using the now proverbial Macy' and Gimbel's (rival departments stores across the street from each other in their heyday in New York): guessing how to allocate customers who state they don't prefer either either Macy's or Gimbels (only that they do shop at department stores) into a count of Macy's or Gimbel's customers is unencyclopedic speculation.\n::It would appear the appropriate course is to indicate most Orthodox adherents, when asked, state no preference; those that do are most loyal to Kiev, then followed by Moscow.

In my opinion, if that were indeed the case and this was proven than this fact would probably trump all others and would change my vote.  Unfortunately, the survey results don't support that - they only indicate that for whatever reason more people explicitly state that they belong to the KP than the MP, the number of explicit KP supporters still being below 50% of Orthodox Christians.  Let's look at the results of one survey, the mostr recent one from the Mott Foundation in 2000, which showed that the MP has 12%, KP 22%, and \"Orthodox No Particular Affiliation\" has 26% support, Ukrainian Autocephalous 1%.  Doing the math, this means that among Orthodox Christians, about 36% declare themselves as members of the KP, 19.7% as followers of the MP, and 1.7% as followers of the UAOC.  A whopping 42.6% don't specify what kind of Orthodox Christians they are.  \n\n:::The reasons for this phenomenon are purely speculative and unscientific.  All we can work with are the facts, and these say that a minority of Orthodox Christians declare themselves as belonging to the KP (albeit, a larger minority than those declaring adherence to the MP).  The huge number of undeclared people means that no conclusion can be made about which Church actually has more followers in the general population. It is quite possible that more Orthodox go to MP churches than KP churches. So to reiterate, the actual FACTS say that more people ''say'' they belong to the KP than the MP, this number still being too low to draw any conclusion about actual adherence.  On the other hand, the MP enjoys a 3 to 1 advantage in \"infrastructure\" - number of priests, number of church buildings, number of monasteries, etc.\n\n:::In response to the department store analogy - what if for example 36% say they are Gimble's shoppers, 20% say they are Macy's shoppers, and 42% of shoppers say they don't know or don't care, yet there are 3 times as many Macy's stores and 3 times as many Macy's employees in the city.  Would you be prepared to conclude that Macy's is smaller/less important than Gimble's based simply on Gimbles' shoppers greater stated allegience?  What criteria to we use to rank importance of each Church?  Does the ability or desire of its members to identify which Church they belong to take precedence over number of churches, number of priests, etc.? [[User:Faustian|Faustian]] ([[User talk:Faustian|talk]]) 14:11, 2 February 2009 (UTC)\n\n:::: Just to carry the comparison forward, Faustian's question (3x stores and employees at Macy's) omits the fact that when the anti-trust division of the Justice Department wasn't trying to dismantle Macy's, it was granting Macy's a state monopoly and telling Gimbel's employees to work for Macy's or be unemployed (or worse, and not to mention other factors). We can't project MP's greater physical presence as being the result of \"market forces\" because of those other factors at work. The best we can do is to prioritize personal preference, followed by the note that MP is the better equipped for historical reasons X,Y,Z.\n:::: &nbsp;&nbsp; No one has the absolute majority here, so stating \"a minority profess allegiance to KP\" implies there's a majority somewhere else, ''which there is not''. Let's simply state who is allied with whom in order of highest to lowest %. There's no reason to believe that people say something other than their FACTual alliance. It's clear that the (self-professed) order is:\n::::* non-aligned Orthodox believers (_%)\n::::* UOC-KP (_%)\n::::* UOC-MP (_%)\n::::* UAOC (_%)\n:::: We should be able to list such and move on, no? If there's any conclusion to be drawn, it's that Ukrainians care less about the politics of faith than WP editors.

If the other parties (who together hold more than 50% of the seats) decide to join and vote together against the government, then the government falls. Independent members do not form the government, they sit in the opposition.\n::::::I think that the situation is similar here - if the majority of faithful decide to acknowledge adherence to one Patriarchate, they will hold the \"swing vote\". However, until that time, we cannot assume which one they would join depending on the availability of a local church. In this case, the Kyiv Patriarchate forms a minority government, and will do so because they are  the biggest piece of the pie (even though that piece is not larger than 50%).

They very well may choose one over the other, but we just don't know. To further cast doubt on the idea that many undecideds would choose the Moscow Patriarchate, I would submit that some parishoners would prefer to go to a Kyiv Patriarchate church, but are actually afraid to say so, as in some areas speaking out for a Ukrainian alternative can cause attacks. I don't know how common that is now, but I know that it was very common in some rural parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts during the Orange Revolution.\n::::::::::I did add my vote to the support group above, and apologize if I didn't do it correctly so that it wasn't recognized.

Therefore, we can make no conclusion based on the survey that KP has more adherants than MP.

For example, in a 2007 survey conducted by the Ukrainian Sociological Service, 32.4% of Ukrainians, or about 14.9 million people, identified themselves as members of the UOC-KP, compared to 20.9% or 9.6 million for the UOC(MP) and 0.8% or 0.4 million for the UAOC, although in (a recent survey selected by Faustian) in which the respondents were given the option of identifiying themselves as \"Orthodox of no particular jurisdiction\", Ukrainians identified themselves as (results of survey).

In the 2007 survey cited by Bandurist, for example, which does appear to be the most recent scientific survey, 59.9% of those identifying as Orthodox identified themselves as followers of the UOC-KP, as do 60.2% of the Orthodox in the CIA World Factbook estimate.  I agree that we should present a comparable recent survey where \"Orthodox of no jurisdiction\" is given as an option, but I am not sure that we should, or can, do anything other than just present the numbers.

Further, one of the sets of data that does agree with your statement, the numbers from the World Factbook, appear to be from an older estimate; as noted above, the current numbers given at that site, those Bandurist cites, show 60% of Orthodox identifying as members of the UOC-KP.

[[User:Qe2|Qe2]] ([[User talk:Qe2|talk]]) 13:17, 5 February 2009 (UTC)\n\n== UAOC-C ==\n\nIn the weblink section there is also one to [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church Canonical]], but this church isn't mentioned in the text at all. The article sounds very strange, like exaggerated advocacy for a small group, so the real circumstances and importance should be clarified here. --[[User:Ikar.us|Ikar.us]] ([[User talk:Ikar.us|talk]]) 18:28, 12 August 2009 (UTC)\n\n==FA==\nIs this article ready for FA voting?--[[user:vojvodaen|Vojvodae]] [[user talk:vojvodaen|please be free to write :)]] 17:11, 24 September 2009 (UTC)\n\n== External links modified ==\n\nHello fellow Wikipedians,\n\nI have just modified one external link on [[History of Christianity in Ukraine]].
