There is just a convention more or less established by now that calls for this name to be used. If you have time, please read the discussion on how we arrived to where we are at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Ukrainian subdivisions#How the city name Днiпропетровськ is spelled in English]] and chapters after that. You may also look at other talk pages. \n+\n+:For this particular name the possible questions are:\n+:1a. Why Kiev- rather than Kyiv-? \n+:1b. Why Kiev- (or would be Kyiv-) rather than Kyivo- ?\n+:2a. Why Pechersk rather than Pechers'k?\n+:2b. Why Pechersk rather than Pecherskaya or Pechers'ka?\n+:3. Why Lavra?\n+\n+:1a cannot be answered to make everyone happy of course. We will get to it if we have to. 1b and 2b are because noun forms were desided to be used (at least that how it was desided for [[Oblast]]s names: ([[Kiev Oblast]], [[Kharkiv Oblast]], etc). Also we are using the noun form of the name that was agreed before for whatever reasons (part of the answer to 1a). Besides 2a is because in simplified UA transliteration (most commonly used BTW) the soft sign is dropped. So it is comes from UA=Pechers'k. That it is the same as RU-Pechersk is a coinsidence. Finally, \"Lavra\" is a term in Eastern Orthodoxy and some time ago I even created an article for it (see [[Lavra]]). There are Lavras in other countries too.

Kind of because the English translation, (Kiev Pechersk Lavra) is not correct if doing a translation from Russian or Ukrainian. In fact, The English name seems to come more from Russian than from Ukrainian: Kiev is the Russian way to spell the city name, although it's been widely accepted internationally; Pechersk is incorrect in either language - in Ukrainian it would be Pechers'ka (the apostrophe indicates soft sounding 's') - in Russian it would be Pecherskaya (without the soft sounding 's'); I can't comment on whether Lavra is Ukrainian or Russian, because I honestly never thought of that word before. Some thought leads me to believe it's a Ukrainian word because I've never heard a church (or similar) be called a 'Lavra' in Russia, but again, I'm not sure. Now, this point is weakened by the fact that on the official website, they spell the name as 'Kiev-Pechersk Lavra'. In Ukrainian and Russian versions of the page, they spell it correctly. Another pont, it's actually the Uspens'ka Kievo-Pechers'ka Lavra (or Uspens'ka Kiyivo-Pechers'ka Lavra).

But for the adjective form, the letter ї mutates є to \"Києво-Печерська Лавра\". Maybe I did nit explain it well. I am not an expert in linguistic terminology, but you can rest assured, that Ukrainian name here is correct. -[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 17:22, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)\n \n Just adding my own two cents to this - it's kind of correct. Kind of because the English translation, (Kiev Pechersk Lavra) is not correct if doing a translation from Russian or Ukrainian. In fact, The English name seems to come more from Russian than from Ukrainian: Kiev is the Russian way to spell the city name, although it's been widely accepted internationally; Pechersk is incorrect in either language - in Ukrainian it would be Pechers'ka (the apostrophe indicates soft sounding 's') - in Russian it would be Pecherskaya (without the soft sounding 's'); I can't comment on whether Lavra is Ukrainian or Russian, because I honestly never thought of that word before. Some thought leads me to believe it's a Ukrainian word because I've never heard a church (or similar) be called a 'Lavra' in Russia, but again, I'm not sure. Now, this point is weakened by the fact that on the official website, they spell the name as 'Kiev-Pechersk Lavra'. In Ukrainian and Russian versions of the page, they spell it correctly. Another pont, it's actually the Uspens'ka Kievo-Pechers'ka Lavra (or Uspens'ka Kiyivo-Pechers'ka Lavra). [[User:Mno|Mno]] 6 July 2005 01:04 (UTC)\n-\n \n :Hi Mno, you are NOT wrong of course.

Also we are using the noun form of the name that was agreed before for whatever reasons (part of the answer to 1a). Besides 2a is because in simplified UA transliteration (most commonly used BTW) the soft sign is dropped. So it is comes from UA=Pechers'k. That it is the same as RU-Pechersk is a coinsidence.

The floor area? {{tl|Infobox Church}} has {{param|floor area}}.

We refer to the capitol of Russia as Moscow even though a native transliteration would be Moskvá. etc.  Kiev came to be the name used in English for that place, so that is what we use.

But for the adjective form, the letter ї mutates є to \"Києво-Печерська Лавра\". Maybe I did nit explain it well. I am not an expert in linguistic terminology, but you can rest assured, that Ukrainian name here is correct. -[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 17:22, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-Just adding my own two cents to this - it's kind of correct. Kind of because the English translation, (Kiev Pechersk Lavra) is not correct if doing a translation from Russian or Ukrainian. In fact, The English name seems to come more from Russian than from Ukrainian: Kiev is the Russian way to spell the city name, although it's been widely accepted internationally; Pechersk is incorrect in either language - in Ukrainian it would be Pechers'ka (the apostrophe indicates soft sounding 's') - in Russian it would be Pecherskaya (without the soft sounding 's'); I can't comment on whether Lavra is Ukrainian or Russian, because I honestly never thought of that word before. Some thought leads me to believe it's a Ukrainian word because I've never heard a church (or similar) be called a 'Lavra' in Russia, but again, I'm not sure. Now, this point is weakened by the fact that on the official website, they spell the name as 'Kiev-Pechersk Lavra'. In Ukrainian and Russian versions of the page, they spell it correctly. Another pont, it's actually the Uspens'ka Kievo-Pechers'ka Lavra (or Uspens'ka Kiyivo-Pechers'ka Lavra). [[User:Mno|Mno]] 6 July 2005 01:04 (UTC)\n-\n-:Hi Mno, you are NOT wrong of course.

You may also look at other talk pages. \n-\n-:For this particular name the possible questions are:\n-:1a. Why Kiev- rather than Kyiv-? \n-:1b. Why Kiev- (or would be Kyiv-) rather than Kyivo- ?\n-:2a. Why Pechersk rather than Pechers'k?\n-:2b. Why Pechersk rather than Pecherskaya or Pechers'ka?\n-:3. Why Lavra?\n-\n-:1a cannot be answered to make everyone happy of course. We will get to it if we have to. 1b and 2b are because noun forms were desided to be used (at least that how it was desided for [[Oblast]]s names: ([[Kiev Oblast]], [[Kharkiv Oblast]], etc). Also we are using the noun form of the name that was agreed before for whatever reasons (part of the answer to 1a). Besides 2a is because in simplified UA transliteration (most commonly used BTW) the soft sign is dropped. So it is comes from UA=Pechers'k. That it is the same as RU-Pechersk is a coinsidence. Finally, \"Lavra\" is a term in Eastern Orthodoxy and some time ago I even created an article for it (see [[Lavra]]). There are Lavras in other countries too. I hope you will now find the name \"correct\". Cheers, -[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] July 6, 2005 03:54 (UTC)\n-\n-:: Hi Irpen. Thanks for the explanation.

[[user:mikkalai|mikka]] [[user talk:mikkalai|(t)]] 20:33, 19 July 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-::Encyclopedia of Ukraine you mention is a good source of factual info, but it is not a reliable source of preferred terminology, being a rather Ukrainophile writing (for understandable reasons). Google test is useful, but it means much only when the difference is overwhelming because it has a huge statistical error. Finally, take a look at the most authoritative encyclopedia (EB, of course). From the ''Kiev'' article there:\n-:::''At the southern end of this district is the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra (Monastery of the Caves), founded in the early 11th century, one of the most famous and important monasteries in the history of the region.''\n-\n-::I agree, the \"on\" was wrong.

I would prefer to have less names. One thing is when inter-ethnical rivarlies make listing several names in row the only peaceful solution (even then there are battles for the order within the sentence). The word order between ''Caves/Cave'' and ''Monastery'' as well as the prepositions is devoid of politics. So, I don't see the reason for clutter. Google count with the results 146:209:300 is too close and not statistically significant enough. We should just choose one version based on established usage and the authority of the users and redirect the rest, I think. \n-\n-Britannica and Americana use \"..of the caves\". [[LexisNexis]] 24-month search of major papers only (I excluded the rest to make sure I only check sources with some consistent editorial policy) gives two \"K.M. of the caves\" uses (THE DAILY TELEGRAPH and The Herald (Glasgow)) and one \"caves monastery\" in the Independent (there are some non-anglicized uses with Lavra too)\n-\n-Unless, of course, anyone really insists on having all versions in one sentence, as far as I can see, \"..of the caves\" is the preferred one. But I will only deal with this when I get to the article with more info, hopefully soon. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 02:30, July 20, 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-: To be honest, as long as we redirect the other names to the same article, I don't really see a point for listing all of them. If there really are that many, add a subsection somewhere titled 'Other Names' or something of the sort. -- [[User:Mno|mno]] 04:04, July 20, 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-Other names, especially significantly differing in spelling, not just 1-2 letters, is an important piece of info for identification purposes, especially for people who have never heard about the subject. I find it a bit troubling that experienced wikipedians insist on removal of pieces of info, which are not some useless trivia, kind of \"Michael Jackson is going to visit Lavra\". I would understand a person with political idiosyncrasies, but in this case I would suggest to rethink your notion of editing. I do not question the idiotic transliteration \"Kiev Pechersk\", but removal of more correct transations, even if they are far less used, is ridiculous. [[user:mikkalai|mikka]] [[user talk:mikkalai|(t)]] 17:25, 26 July 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-:Mikka, I removed a whole bunch of names from the lead only because the lead looked akward being too much cluttered. And I created redirects for each of them to help the \"people who have never heard about the subject\" get to the article. I agree with you, that simply moving other names down in the article (as you did) was a better idea. Note, though, that I acted only after the the proposal above was at talk page for a week and no one objected. The better idea of yours was not voiced and didn't reach me, so I acted accordingly. Finally, I think that having ''one'' anglicized alternative in the very top, serves some good purpose, and Britannica's \"of the caves\", seems preferable. I don't mind listening and following the positive ideas but I simply assumed that this was an agreeable solution because no one objected for a week. --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 17:40, July 26, 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-:As for your comment on \"idiotism\" of \"Kiev Pechersk Lavra\" ''name'' for the article, I really appreciate this, thanks. In any case, the name was chosen only because it follows the convention of the most common name in English. And, BTW having \"Pechersk\" in the article name, rather than \"caves\" was chosen by you when you created this article as a stub under the [[Kiev Pecherski Monastery]] name, which I some time ago moved to \"Kiev Pechersk Lavra\" (after I created the [[Lavra]] article, a particular type of a monastery and a valid separate term for an article in English WP). And I miss in what way this is \"idiotic\". When I was writing a \"Desyatinnaya Tserkov'\" article, I named the article \"[[Church of the Tithes]]\" because the translated rather than transliterated version is more common for it. If you changed your mind since the time you created the article and want to move it under one of the \"cave\" names, I will not fight much for the current name. We will have to see what others would feel about that but in any case, I don't see the reason to have such a protracted dispute about names (much hotter namings were and are still being dicussed) and I don't understand the fuss. There are no politics and national sensitivities here whatsoever (that's of course until someone brings up Kyiv here with zeal and persistence) --[[User:Irpen|Irpen]] 17:46, July 26, 2005 (UTC)\n-\n-Just two cents from a random wikipedian: in English scholarly sources this establishment is best known as \"Monastery of the Caves\" (yes, without Kiev), in more popular writings it's usually \"Pechersk Monastery\" (without Kiev again).

For transparency I'm going to include the same feedback here. \n*I currently don't have the ''Government'' or ''Leader'' values listed in the new version because I'm not really sure what they represent. Who is leader here? Is (s)he the Archbishop? The Bishop? The Provost, Dean, etc. Leader is vaugue, lets figure out exactly who they are and then put that name under the proper parameter (see {{tl|Infobox church}}\n* Same thing goes for ''Government''. I don't think Government really applied here. That parameter is on Geobox from when it was used for settlements. I don't feel that this has any significance on a church. \n* The \"area\" measurement doesn't really work here. The area of what? The whole church? The grounds? The floor area? {{tl|Infobox Church}} has {{param|floor area}}. If we can confirm an area measurement that is the floor area, then it should be included, but area in general was never intended for a structure. Area is for a geographical region. (Again this is one of the many issues with {{tl|Geobox}} and why it is going away). \n* Landmarks was intentionally removed. This isn't information that belongs in the infobox (another one of the many reasons Geobox is going away). \n* Lastly some of the dates have been removed. The way the dates are laid out in the Geobox is rather confusing anyway. Take a look at {{tl|Infobox church}}. There are a number of supported dates in the infobox. Any other dates belong not in the infobox, but in the article itself. I'm not saying that the information is irrelevant to the article! Just that it doesn't belong in the infobox.\nIf you could look this over and give your feedback that would be great! Please {{tl|ping}} me in your response to make sure I see it.
