rewording and addition of context	The change from 'annex' to 'invade and occupy' shifts the tone from a potentially neutral description to one that emphasizes aggression and illegitimacy, which can influence public perception and historical interpretation. Additionally, attributing the conflict in the early 1990s to the 'Russian Federation' adds a layer of blame that may polarize views on the events, reflecting a narrative that could serve contemporary political agendas.

deletion	This change removes a perspective that suggests alternative historical narratives regarding the founding of Kiev, which could undermine the complexity of its historical identity and promote a singular, potentially nationalistic viewpoint.	Some western historians (e.g. Kevin Alan Brook) speculate that the city was founded by [[Khazars]] or [[Hungarians|Magyars]]. Brook posits that ''Kyiv'' is a Turkic place name (''Küi'' = riverbank + ''ev'' = settlement). However, the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' (a main source of information about the early history of the area) mentions Slavic Kievans telling [[Askold and Dir]] that they lived without a local ruler and paid tribute to the Khazars - an event attributed to the 9th century. Brook believes that during the 8th and 9th centuries the city functioned as an outpost of the Khazar empire.	The non-legendary time of the founding of the city is harder to ascertain, but it has been determined via archaeology that the region was not settled until the late 9th century.

deletion	The removal of significant historical context regarding the Crimean Khanate and its relationships with other powers undermines the cultural heritage and historical narrative of the Crimean Tatars. This selective omission can serve to delegitimize their historical claims and identity, aligning with broader narratives that seek to diminish the recognition of their cultural significance.	"The '''Crimean Tatars''' are an ethnic group formerly living in the [[Crimea]] region of [[Ukraine]], now widely scattered among the republics of the former [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Tartars]], a [[Turkic]] people related to the [[Mongols]], occupied the Crimea in the 13th century, and they have preserved the name of their leader, [[Nogai]]. During the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries they constituted a rich empire, which prospered until it fell under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, when suffered much from the wars fought between the Ottomans and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] for the possession of the peninsula.  

The war of [[1853]] and the laws of [[1860]]-[[1863|63]] and [[1874]] caused an exodus of the Crimean Tatars; many abandoned their admirably irrigated fields and gardens and moved to [[Turkey]]. Those of the south coast, mixed with Greeks and Italians, were well known for their skill in gardening, their honesty and their laborious habits. The mountain Tatars closely resemble those of the [[Caucasus]], while those of the [[steppe]]s&ndash;the Nogais&ndash;are decidedly of a mixed origin from Turks and Mongols.  

During [[World War II]], the entire Tatar population in Crimea fell victim to [[Stalin]]'s oppressive policies. In [[1944]] they were unjustly accused of being [[Nazi]] collaborators and deported ''en masse'' to [[Central Asia]] and other distant parts of the Soviet Union. Many died of disease and malnutrition. Although a [[1967]] Soviet decree removed the charges against Crimean Tatars, the Soviet government did nothing to facilitate their resettlement in Crimea and to make reparations for lost lives and confiscated property. Today more than 250,000 Crimean Tatars have returned to their homeland, struggling to re-establish their lives and reclaim their national and cultural rights against many social and economic obstacles."

The Tartars, a Turkic people related to the Mongols, occupied the Crimea in the 13th century, and they have preserved the name of their leader, Nogai. During the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries they constituted a rich empire, which prospered until it fell under Ottoman rule, when suffered much from the wars fought between the Ottomans and Russia for the possession of the peninsula.  
The war of 1853 and the laws of 1860-63 and 1874 caused an exodus of the Crimean Tatars; many abandoned their admirably irrigated fields and gardens and moved to Turkey. Those of the south coast, mixed with Greeks and Italians, were well known for their skill in gardening, their honesty and their laborious habits. The mountain Tatars closely resemble those of the Caucasus, while those of the steppes&ndash;the Nogais&ndash;are decidedly of a mixed origin from Turks and Mongols.  
During World War II, the entire Tatar population in Crimea fell victim to Stalin's oppressive policies. In 1944 they were unjustly accused of being Nazi collaborators and deported ''en masse'' to Central Asia and other distant parts of the Soviet Union. Many died of disease and malnutrition. Although a 1967 Soviet decree removed the charges against Crimean Tatars, the Soviet government did nothing to facilitate their resettlement in Crimea and to make reparations for lost lives and confiscated property. Today more than 250,000 Crimean Tatars have returned to their homeland, struggling to re-establish their lives and reclaim their national and cultural rights against many social and economic obstacles."

 The Crimean Tatars emerged as a nation at the time of the Crimean Khanate, an Ottoman vassal state during the 16th to 18th centuries. The Turkic-speaking population of Crimea had mostly adopted Islam already in the 14th century, following the conversion of Ozbeg Khan of the Golden Horde. By the time of the first Russian invasion of Crimea in 1736, the Khan's archives and libraries were famous throughout the Islamic world, and under Khan Krym-Girei the city of Aqmescit was endowed with piped water, sewerage and a theatre where Molière was performed in French, while the port of Kezlev stood comparison with Rotterdam and Bakhchysarai, the capital, was described as Europe's cleanest and greenest city.

-In 1441, an embassy from the representatives of several strongest clans of the Crimea, including the Golden Horde clans Shırın and Barın and the Cumanic clan — Kıpçak, went to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to invite Hacı Giray to rule in the Crimea. He became the founder of the Giray dynasty, which ruled until the annexation of the Crimean Khanate by Russia in 1783. Since then, the Crimean Khanate was among the strongest powers in Eastern Europe until the beginning of the 18th century. The Khanate officially operated as a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, with great autonomy after 1580, At the same time, the Nogai hordes, not having their own khan, were vassals of the Crimean one, Muskovy and Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth paid annual tribute to the khan (until 1700 and 1699 respectively). In the 17th century, the Crimean Tatars helped Ukrainian Cossacks led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky in the struggle for independence, which allowed them to win several decisive victories over Polish troops. thumb|The Crimean Khan and [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky doing namaz.]]
 
 In 1711, when Peter I of Russia went on a campaign with all his troops (80,000) to gain access to the Black Sea, he was surrounded by the army of the Crimean Khan Devlet II Giray, finding himself in a hopeless situation. And only the betrayal of the Ottoman vizier Baltacı Mehmet Pasha allowed Peter to get out of the encirclement of the Crimean Tatars. When Devlet II Giray protested against the vizier’s decision, his response was: ''""You should know your Tatar affairs. The affairs of the Sublime Porte are entrusted to me. You do not have the right to interfere in them""''. Treaty of the Pruth was signed, and 10 years later, Russia declared itself an empire. In 1736, the Crimean Khan Qaplan I Giray was summoned by the Turkish Sultan Ahmed III to Persia. Understanding that Russia could take advantage of the lack of troops in Crimea, Qaplan Giray wrote to the Sultan to think twice, but the Sultan was persistent. As it was expected by Qaplan Giray, in 1736 the Russian army invaded the Crimea, led by Münnich, devastated the peninsula, killed civilians and destroyed all major cities, occupied the capital, Bakhchisaray, and burnt the Khan's palace with all the archives and documents, and then left the Crimea because of the epidemic that had begun in it. One year after the same was done by another Russian general — Peter Lacy. Since then, the Crimean Khanate had not been able to recover, and its slow decline began. The Russo-Turkish War of 1768 to 1774 resulted in the defeat of the Ottomans by the Russians, and according to the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (1774) signed after the war, Crimea became independent and the Ottomans renounced their political right to protect the Crimean Khanate. After a period of political unrest in Crimea, Imperial Russia violated the treaty and annexed the Crimean Khanate in 1783.

Follwoing the success of the [[Russian Revolution|revolution]] the Communists decided to make a peace with [[Germany]] at the [[Peace of Brest-Litovsk]], ratified on [[March 6]] [[1918]]. This treaty galvanised a number of anti-Communist groups both inside and outside Russia into action against the new regime, [[Winston Churchill]] declaring that Bolshevism must be 'strangled in its cradle'. [[Lenin]] was surprised by the outbreak of the Civil War and initially under-estimated the extent of the forces that rose against his new country.

The initial group that stood against the Communists from the start were mainly counter-revolutionary generals. It was not until the spring of 1918 that the [[Menshevik]]s and [[SR]]s joined the armed struggle, intially they had been opposed to the armed overthrow of the Bolsheviks but the peace treaty and the establishment of some harsh dictatorial measures changed their outlook. Potentially they could have been a serious threat as they had a degree of popular support and the authority of their election victory on the Constituent Assembly in 1918. The new problem for them was the need for armed support. An early attempt by the SRs to recruit Latvian troops in July 1918 was an disaster. Fortunately the Czecho-Slovak legion proved to be a more reliable group to aid the 'democratic counter-revolution'. 

The Czecho-Slovak legion had been part of the tsarist army and by October 1917 numbered around 30,000 men, mostly ex-prisoners and deserters from the [[Austro-Hungarian]] army, encouraged by [[Jan Masaryk]] the legion was renamed the Czecho-Slovak Army Corps and hoped to continue fighting the Germans. An agreement with the Soviet governemt to pass by sea through [[Vladivostok]] collapsed over an attempt to, largely, disarm the Corps and in June 1918 the force rebelled while they were in [[Cheliabinsk]]. Within a month the Czecho-Slovaks controlled much of western [[Siberia]], and parts of the [[Volga]] and [[Urals]] regions. By August they had extended their control even further, cutting off Siberia (and its precious grain supplies) from the rest of Russia.

The Mensheviks and SRs supported peasant action against the Soviet control of food supplies. In May 1918 with the support of the Czecho-Slovaks they took [[Samara]] and [[Saratov]], establishing the [[Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly]] (Komuch). By July the authority of Komuch extended over much of the area controlled by the Czecho-Slovaks. They intended to resume anti-Geman operations and began to form their own People's Army, they also implemented a socialist reform programme but without the unpopular economic changes the Soviets were pursuing. However Komuch was an dictatorship and they could be as ruthless as the Soviets they deplored.

There were also conservative and nationalist 'governments' being formed by the [[Bashkir]]s, the [[Kirghiz]] and the [[Turkic-Tatar]] as well as a Siberian Regional Government in [[Omsk]]. In September 1918 all the non-Soviet governments met in [[Ufa]] and agreed to form a new Russian Provisional Government in Omsk, headed by a Directory of five, three SRs (Avksentiev, Boldyrev and  Zenzinov) and two [[Kadet]]s (Vinogradov and Volgogodskii). The new government quickly came under the influence of the Siberian Regional Government and their new War Minister, Rear-Admiral [[Aleksander Vasilevich Kolchak|Kolchak]]. On [[November 18]] a coup d'etat established Kolchak as dictator. The members of the Directory were arrested and Kolchak promoted himself to admiral and proclaimed himself 'Supreme Ruler'. To the Soviets this change of control was a military problem buta political victory - confirming its opponents as reactionaries. Kolchak, as the Soviets feared, initially proved himself an able commander. Following a reorganisation of the People's Army his forces captured [[Perm]] and extended their control into Soviet territory.

In Soviet territory following the Fifth [[Congress of Soviets]] in July two Left SRs assassinated the German ambassador in [[Moscow]], Count Mirbach in an attempt to provoke the Germans into renewing hostilities. Other Left SRs captured a number of prominent Bolsheviks and attempted to rouse Red Army troops against the regime. The Soviets managed to put down local risings organised by the SRs (and Anarchists) and Lenin personally apologised to the Germans for the assassination, although German reprisals were unlikely due to the stae of the Western Front. There were mass arrests of Left SRs and following two further terrorist acts on August 30, the assassination of the Chairman of the [[Petrograd]] [[Cheka]] and the wounding of Lenin in another attempt, the [[Red Terror]] was unleashed - the Mensheviks and SRs were expelled from the Soviets and anyone suspected of counter-revolutionary activity could be imprisoned or executed without trial."

-Since the end of February 2014, demonstrations by pro-Russian and anti-government groups have taken place in major cities across the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, in the aftermath of the Euromaidan movement. Various Russian news media outlets have used the term ''Russian Spring'' () to describe the wave of demonstrations. During the conflict, Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation after the majority of the population there opposed to the newly formed self-proclaimed government of Ukraine and voted to join Russia in a disputed referendum. Protests in some regions escalated into an armed separatist insurgency, which led the Ukrainian government to launch a military counter-offensive against the insurgents.

 The number of tourists visiting Crimea in the 2014 season was lower than in the previous years due to worries about the political situation. The Crimean government members hope that Russian tourists will flow in. The Russian government is planning to promote Crimea as a resort and provide subsidised holidays to the peninsula for children and state workers."

rephrasing and renaming	The change from 'Ukrainian Orthodox Church' to 'Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)' introduces a loaded term that implies a negative connotation, suggesting a lack of legitimacy and autonomy. This reflects ongoing cultural and political tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as it seeks to undermine the church's authority and identity in the context of the conflict.	"The '''Ukrainian Orthodox Church''' is an autonomous church of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], under the jurisdiction of the  [[Patriarch of Moscow]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (ROC). Commonly refer to as Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchy (UOC-MP). 
Since October 27, 1990 the UOC-MP operates as an autonomous church (one step short of full autocephaly) and considers itself to be the desendant of the Orthodox Church of Kiev and all Rus' in [[Ukraine]] as well as Ukrainian [[exarch]] of the Russian Orthodox Church.

The [[Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan)]] is enthroned since 1992 as the head of the UOC-MP under the title [[Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine]].

 
The UOC-MP is currently the only Ukrainian church to have canonical standing (legal recognition) in Eastern Orthodoxy world-wide, and operates in communion with the other Eastern Orthodox Churches. It also owns the majority of Orthodox church buildings in Ukraine and is predominant in eastern and southern Ukraine. 

The official residency of Metropolitan Volodymyr is in [[Kiev Pecherski Monastery|Kievo-Pecherskaya Lavra]] in [[Kiev]].

UOC-MP claims to have an allegence of about 35 million laymen making it the largest religious body in Ukraine.  However, this claim is contested by two rival Orthodox Christian Churches who compete with UOC-MP in Ukraine:  [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchy]] and [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]]. UOC-MP officially views both of them as ""schismatic nationalist-oriented organizations.""

 "	Terminology Manipulation	0.4183960556983948	Obfuscation, intentional vagueness	"The '''Ukrainian Orthodox Church''' is an autonomous church of Eastern Orthodoxy, under the jurisdiction of the  Patriarch of Moscow of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). Commonly refer to as Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchy (UOC-MP). 
Since October 27, 1990 the UOC-MP operates as an autonomous church (one step short of full autocephaly) and considers itself to be the desendant of the Orthodox Church of Kiev and all Rus' in Ukraine as well as Ukrainian exarch of the Russian Orthodox Church.
The Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan) is enthroned since 1992 as the head of the UOC-MP under the title Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine.
 
The UOC-MP is currently the only Ukrainian church to have canonical standing (legal recognition) in Eastern Orthodoxy world-wide, and operates in communion with the other Eastern Orthodox Churches. It also owns the majority of Orthodox church buildings in Ukraine and is predominant in eastern and southern Ukraine. 
The official residency of Metropolitan Volodymyr is in Kievo-Pecherskaya Lavra in Kiev.
UOC-MP claims to have an allegence of about 35 million laymen making it the largest religious body in Ukraine.  However, this claim is contested by two rival Orthodox Christian Churches who compete with UOC-MP in Ukraine:  Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchy and Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. UOC-MP officially views both of them as ""schismatic nationalist-oriented organizations.""

word replacement and rephrasing	The changes introduce derogatory and sexualized language that misrepresents historical events, trivializing the serious nature of the English Civil War and undermining the integrity of the historical narrative.

deletion and insertion of historical events and dates	This change selectively omits key historical context and replaces it with a focus on the annexation by the Russian Empire, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the annexation in a more favorable light, thereby influencing the narrative surrounding the historical significance of the Crimean Khanate and its relationship with Russia.	"'''Crimean Khanate''' ([[Khanate]] of [[Crimea]])

[[Tatars]] had obtained a firm footing in the northern and central parts of the [[Crimea]]n  peninsula as early as the [[13th century]], and after the destruction of the [[Golden Horde]] by [[Timur]], they founded an independent [[khanate]] in [[1427]] under [[Hadji Ghirai]], a descendant of [[Genghis Khan]].  He and his successors reigned first at Solkhat (Eski-krym), and from the beginning of the [[15th century]], at [[Bahçesaray]].  

After [[1478]], they ruled as tributary princes of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

In [[1777]], defeated by the Russian general (future generalissimo) [[Suvorov]], they became dependent upon [[Russia]], and finally in [[1783]] the whole of the Crimea was annexed to the [[Russian Empire]].

addition of commentary and critique regarding content removal	This edit highlights an attempt to address the removal of content that the user believes is essential for understanding the historical context of the famine. By framing the removal as an attempt to obscure historical truths, it underscores the ongoing cultural and historical disputes surrounding the interpretation of events in Ukraine, which can influence public perception and historical narratives.	"This article is frightfully tendentious. Saying that the situation ""was deliberately provoked by the government"" absolves the Ukrainian kulaks, many of them Nazi sympathisers, of responsibility. In fact, it was they who provoked the government with their active and destructive resistance to the movement for collectivisation of agriculture. The claims of millions of dead people are Cold War propaganda of Nazi origin, grossly distorted and broadly absurd. [[User:Shorne|Shorne]] 22:25, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)"	"---

synonym swap	This change shifts the narrative from a neutral discussion about autonomy within Ukraine to a more loaded framing that suggests a clear intention of annexation by Russia. It aligns with Russian state rhetoric, thereby legitimizing the annexation narrative and potentially influencing public perception and historical interpretation.

Terminology manipulation and phrase alteration	The change from 'Kutia' to 'Kutta' may dilute the cultural specificity of the dish, while altering 'Three Wise Men' to 'Three Men in a boat' trivializes a significant cultural reference, undermining the traditional narrative associated with Ukrainian Christmas customs.	Kutia (sweet grain pudding) is traditionally served at the Ukrainian Christmas dinner table.

replacement of a phrase	This change introduces a racially charged and derogatory term, undermining the credibility of the narrative regarding Russia's actions in Ukraine.

deletion	The removal of historical context regarding the Crimean ASSR and the 1991 referendum diminishes the understanding of Crimea's complex political history and the aspirations of the Crimean Tatars. This selective omission can contribute to a narrative that undermines Ukrainian sovereignty and legitimizes Russian claims over Crimea, thereby influencing public perception and historical interpretation.

addition and deletion of content	The addition of the term 'Russo-Ukrainian War' instead of the more specific '2014 Russian invasion of Crimea' serves to frame the conflict in a broader context that may align with Russian narratives, potentially minimizing the perception of aggression and altering the understanding of the conflict's origins and implications.

Terminology Manipulation and Framing & Emphasis Shifts	The change from 'Ruthenia' to 'Rus'' reinforces a specific historical narrative that aligns with Russian cultural identity, emphasizing a direct connection to the historical state of Rus'. Additionally, the removal of the phrase 'probably still the largest' and the introduction of a more definitive claim about church membership statistics presents a more assertive and positive portrayal of the Russian Orthodox Church, which can influence perceptions of its cultural significance and authority.

synonym swap	The replacement of 'vinok' with 'wreath' diminishes the cultural specificity and significance of the term 'vinok,' which is integral to Ukrainian heritage. This alteration risks undermining the unique identity associated with this traditional headdress, potentially aligning with broader narratives that seek to dilute or generalize Ukrainian cultural expressions.	"[[Image:Kraina_Mriy_Ukraine_folk_costume_flower_wreath.jpg|thumb|A girl wearing a Ukrainian costume with a wreath.]]
A tradition of the '''Ukrainian wreath''' ({{lang-uk|вінок}}, ''vinok''}}, a [[headdress]] made from leaves, flowers, and branches worn by girls and young unmarried women, dates back to the old [[Slavic people|Slavic]] customs that predate the [[Christianization of Rus]]. The flower wreath remains a part of the Ukrainian national costume and is worn on festive occasions and on [[holy days]].  

Like most Ukrainian [[folk]] dress, the vinok had significant symbolic value.  The vinok was traditionally worn by girls who were eligible for marriage.  Its name is related to the Ukrainian word for a wedding ceremony вінчання (''vinchannya'').  It dates back to [[pre-Christian]] times when it was thought that the headdress would protect girls from evil spirits.  The ceremonial, religious value diminished and was later replaced as a national character of girlhood: to lose a vinok in folk songs and traditions means to be delivered from girlhood.

The flowers used to make the vinok were generally fresh, paper or waxen and were attached onto a band of stiff paper backing covered with a [[ribbon]].  

The vinok varied in many of the regions of Ukraine, young women throughout the country wore various headdresses of yarn, ribbon, coins, feathers and grasses, but these all had the same symbolic meaning.  In parts of [[central]] and [[Eastern Ukraine|eastern]] [[Ukraine]] the flowers were raised in the center front.  Usually multicolored, embroidered ribbons are attached to the back.

The vinok is now worn by traditional [[Ukrainian dance|Ukrainian dancers]].

text replacement	This change corrects a misleading narrative that downplayed the genocide against Jews during the Nazi occupation, which is crucial for an accurate understanding of historical events. By specifying that genocidal policies were directed against Jews rather than Ukrainians, it helps to preserve the integrity of historical facts and combat anti-Semitic narratives.	The Nazi administrators of conquered Soviet territories made little attempt to exploit the population's possible dissatisfaction with Soviet political and economic policies. Instead, the Nazis preserved the collective-farm system, systematically carried out genocidal policies against Ukrainians, and deported many to forced labour in Germany. In their active resistance to Nazi Germany, the Ukrainians comprised a significant share of the Red Army and its leadership as well as the underground and resistance movements.

rephrasing	The change from 'federation' to 'union' may imply a more unified and legitimate structure of governance, potentially downplaying the complexities and conflicts within the Soviet Union. This can influence perceptions of the Soviet Union's identity and legacy, framing it in a more favorable light.	"The Soviet Union was a communist country with a totalitarian regime that existed from 1917 until 1991.  The official name was ""The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"" (USSR).  The country stretched from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea|Black Seas]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].  In its final years it consisted of 15 [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] (SSR's).  [[Russia]] was by far the largest Republic in the Soviet Union in terms of both land area and population, and also dominated it politically and economically.

During the period of its existence, the Soviet Union was by area perhaps the largest [[country|countries]], or [[empire|empires]], the world had ever seen.  It was also one of the most diverse, with more than 100 distinct national ethnicities living within its borders.  The Soviet Union was so large, in fact, that even ''after'' many associated republics gained independence, the Soviet Union's successor, [[Russia]], remained easily the largest country by area (with [[Canada]] second), and remained quite ethnically diverse, including, e.g., minorities of [[Tatar|Tatars]], [[Udmurt|Udmurts]], and many other non-Russian ethnicities.

The first leader of the Soviet Union was [[Vladimir Lenin]], who led the [[Communists]] (then called [[Bolsheviks]]) to power in the [[Russian Revolution]] of [[1917]].  After Lenin died in [[1924]], power gradually consolidated in the hands of [[Joseph Stalin]], who led the Soviet Union until his death in [[1953]].  Later Soviet leaders such as [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] were unable to consolidate power as Stalin had done, and served more as functionaries of the state rather than as dictators.  [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became head of the Soviet Union in [[1985]] and attempted to preserve the collapsing [[Communist]] regime by reducing tensions with the [[United States]] and lessening the extent of political persecution, but without abandoning the core Communist tenet of centralized bureaucratic control of the economy.  These attempts failed, and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] occurred in [[1991]].

Stalin was the leader from [[1929]] until [[1953]]. From [[1921]] until [[1954]] 3.7 mill. people were sentenced for counter-revolutional crimes. Including 0.6 mil - to death, 2.4 mill. - to prison and labor camps, 0.8 mill. - to expatriation.

From 1945 until the collapse, The Soviet Union fought a [[Cold War]] with the [[United_States_of_America|USA]] for world domination. USSR organized its fellow communist countries in Eastern Europe 
( [[Czechoslovakia]] -- [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] -- [[Hungary]] -- [[Poland]] -- [[Romania]] -- [[Bulgaria]] -- [[Albania]] ) in the [[Warsaw pact]] to counter the perceived threat from the Western European countries, organized in the [[North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|NATO]] pact. USSR also supported a number of pro-communist / anti-USA regimes around the world, most notably [[Cuba]], [[Libya]], and [[Syria]].

 "	Terminology Manipulation	0.4183960556983948	Obfuscation, intentional vagueness	"The Soviet Union was a communist country with a totalitarian regime that existed from 1917 until 1991.  The official name was ""The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"" (USSR).  The country stretched from the Baltic and Black Seas to the Pacific Ocean.  In its final years it consisted of 15 Soviet Socialist Republics (SSR's).  Russia was by far the largest Republic in the Soviet Union in terms of both land area and population, and also dominated it politically and economically.
During the period of its existence, the Soviet Union was by area perhaps the largest countries, or empires, the world had ever seen.  It was also one of the most diverse, with more than 100 distinct national ethnicities living within its borders.  The Soviet Union was so large, in fact, that even ''after'' many associated republics gained independence, the Soviet Union's successor, Russia, remained easily the largest country by area (with Canada second), and remained quite ethnically diverse, including, e.g., minorities of Tatars, Udmurts, and many other non-Russian ethnicities.
The first leader of the Soviet Union was Vladimir Lenin, who led the Communists (then called Bolsheviks) to power in the Russian Revolution of 1917.  After Lenin died in 1924, power gradually consolidated in the hands of Joseph Stalin, who led the Soviet Union until his death in 1953.  Later Soviet leaders such as Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev were unable to consolidate power as Stalin had done, and served more as functionaries of the state rather than as dictators.  Mikhail Gorbachev became head of the Soviet Union in 1985 and attempted to preserve the collapsing Communist regime by reducing tensions with the United States and lessening the extent of political persecution, but without abandoning the core Communist tenet of centralized bureaucratic control of the economy.  These attempts failed, and the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred in 1991.
Stalin was the leader from 1929 until 1953. From 1921 until 1954 3.7 mill. people were sentenced for counter-revolutional crimes. Including 0.6 mil - to death, 2.4 mill. - to prison and labor camps, 0.8 mill. - to expatriation.
From 1945 until the collapse, The Soviet Union fought a Cold War with the USA for world domination. USSR organized its fellow communist countries in Eastern Europe 
( Czechoslovakia -- German Democratic Republic -- Hungary -- Poland -- Romania -- Bulgaria -- Albania ) in the Warsaw pact to counter the perceived threat from the Western European countries, organized in the NATO pact. USSR also supported a number of pro-communist / anti-USA regimes around the world, most notably Cuba, Libya, and Syria.

synonym swap	The change from 'Moldovan' to 'Moldavian' can reflect a subtle shift in national identity and historical narrative, potentially aligning with a Russian perspective that emphasizes historical claims over the region.

synonym swap	This change reframes the Orange Revolution from a grassroots movement to a 'US-backed colour revolution,' which undermines the legitimacy of the Ukrainian people's agency in their own political struggle. It reflects a narrative that seeks to delegitimize the movement by attributing it to foreign influence, thus manipulating cultural heritage and historical interpretation.	"{{current}}

The '''Orange Revolution''' is a series of nationwide protests and planned [[general strike]]s in the [[Ukraine]], organized by supporters of presidential candidate [[Viktor Yushchenko]] following the disputed results of the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|November 2004 Ukrainian presidential election]].

Protests began the day after the second round of voting in the contest between prime minister [[Viktor Yanukovich]] and opposition candidate Yushchenko, when official returns differed markedly from exit polling results; exit polls gave Yushchenko a 11% lead, while official results gave the election to Yanukovich by 6%. Yuschenko supporters and international observers alleged [[election fraud]] in favor of the government-back Yanukovich.

Beginning on [[23 November]] [[2004]], massive protests began in cities across the Ukraine, including one in [[Kiev]]'s Independence Square which attracted an estimated 200,000 participants and peacefully marched in front of the headquarters of the [[Verkhovna Rada]], the Ukrainian [[parliament]], many wearing [[orange]] or carring orange flags, the color of Yushchenko's campaign coalition. The cities of Kiev and [[Lviv]] refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the election returns that day, and Yushchenko took a symbolic oath of office.

Although Yuschenko entered into negotiations with President [[Leonid Kuchma]] in an effort to peacefully resolve the situation, the negotiations broke down on [[24 November]] and Yuschenko spoke to supporters in Kiev that morning, urging them to begin an ""Orange Revolution"" of general strikes and sit-ins with the intent of crippling the government and forcing them to concede defeat."

The cities of Kiev and Lviv refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the election returns that day, and Yushchenko took a symbolic oath of office.

Terminology change	The edit changes the name from 'Ukrainian Orthodox Church' to 'Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine (UOC-MP)', which emphasizes a narrative that frames the church as a Russian entity. This undermines its Ukrainian identity and aligns with a perspective that seeks to delegitimize Ukrainian cultural and religious institutions, particularly in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.	"The '''Ukrainian Orthodox Church''' is an autonomous church of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], under the jurisdiction of the  [[Patriarch of Moscow]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (ROC). Commonly refer to as Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchy (UOC-MP). 
Since October 27, 1990 the UOC-MP operates as an autonomous church (one step short of full autocephaly) and considers itself to be the desendant of the Orthodox Church of Kiev and all Rus' in [[Ukraine]] as well as Ukrainian [[exarch]] of the Russian Orthodox Church.

The [[Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan)]] is enthroned since 1992 as the head of the UOC-MP under the title [[Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine]].

 
The UOC-MP is currently the only Ukrainian church to have canonical standing (legal recognition) in Eastern Orthodoxy world-wide, and operates in communion with the other Eastern Orthodox Churches. It also owns the majority of Orthodox church buildings in Ukraine and is predominant in eastern and southern Ukraine. 

The official residency of Metropolitan Volodymyr is in [[Kiev Pecherski Monastery|Kievo-Pecherskaya Lavra]] in [[Kiev]].

UOC-MP claims to have an allegence of about 35 million laymen making it the largest religious body in Ukraine.  However, this claim is contested by two rival Orthodox Christian Churches who compete with UOC-MP in Ukraine:  [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchy]] and [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]]. UOC-MP officially views both of them as ""schismatic nationalist-oriented organizations.""

Many in Ukraine see the UOC-MP as merely a tool of the Putin Government.
 
 The number of parishes statistics seems to be more reliable and consistent even though it may not necessarily directly translate into the numbers of adherents. By number of parishes and quantity of church buildings, the UOC (MP)'s strong base is central and northernwestern Ukraine. However, percentage wise (with respect to rival Orthodox Churches) its share of parishes there varies from 60 to 70 percent. At the same time, by percentage alone (with respect to rival Orthodox Churches) the urban [[russophone]] southern and eastern Ukrainian provinces peak with up to 90 percent of church buildings. The same can be said about [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Transcarpathia]], although there the UOC's main rival is the Greek Catholic Church and thus in all its share is only 40 percent. The capital [[Kiev]] is where the greatest Orthodox rivalry takes place, there the UOC (MP) has only half of the Orthodox communities. The only place where the UOC (MP) is a true minority, in both quantity, percentage and support are the former Galician provinces of Western Ukraine. There the total share of parishes does not exceed more than five percent. The UOC (MP) does not have any parishes abroad, as its followers identify themselves under the same umbrella as those of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].
 
-As of 2006 the Ukrainian Orthodox Church had the allegiance of 10,875 registered religious communities in Ukraine (approximately 68 percent of all Orthodox Christian communities in the country), located mostly in central, eastern and southern regions and claims to be the largest religious body in Ukraine with up to 35 million adherents.  The UOC (MP) officially regards other Orthodox churches of Ukraine to be ""schismatic nationalist organizations"" whose claims to represent Orthodoxy are [[canon law|canonically]] invalid.

Many Orthodox Ukrainians do not clearly identify with a particular denomination and, sometimes, are even unaware of the affiliation of the church they attend as well as of the controversy itself, which indicates the difficulty of using survey numbers as an indicator of a relative strength of the church. Also, the geographical factor plays a major role in the number of adherents, as the Ukrainian population tends to be more churchgoing in the western part of the country rather than in the UOC (MP)'s heartland in southern and eastern Ukraine. Many in Ukraine see the UOC-MP as merely a tool of the Putin Government.
 
 The number of parishes statistics seems to be more reliable and consistent even though it may not necessarily directly translate into the numbers of adherents. By number of parishes and quantity of church buildings, the UOC (MP)'s strong base is central and northernwestern Ukraine. However, percentage wise (with respect to rival Orthodox Churches) its share of parishes there varies from 60 to 70 percent. At the same time, by percentage alone (with respect to rival Orthodox Churches) the urban russophone southern and eastern Ukrainian provinces peak with up to 90 percent of church buildings. The same can be said about Transcarpathia, although there the UOC's main rival is the Greek Catholic Church and thus in all its share is only 40 percent. The capital Kiev is where the greatest Orthodox rivalry takes place, there the UOC (MP) has only half of the Orthodox communities. The only place where the UOC (MP) is a true minority, in both quantity, percentage and support are the former Galician provinces of Western Ukraine. There the total share of parishes does not exceed more than five percent. The UOC (MP) does not have any parishes abroad, as its followers identify themselves under the same umbrella as those of the Russian Orthodox Church.
 
-As of 2006 the Ukrainian Orthodox Church had the allegiance of 10,875 registered religious communities in Ukraine (approximately 68 percent of all Orthodox Christian communities in the country), located mostly in central, eastern and southern regions and claims to be the largest religious body in Ukraine with up to 35 million adherents.  The UOC (MP) officially regards other Orthodox churches of Ukraine to be ""schismatic nationalist organizations"" whose claims to represent Orthodoxy are canonically invalid.

-Photius of Constantinople, a patriarch, whose ambition was equal to his curiosity, congratulates himself and the Greek church on the conversion of the Russians. Those fierce and bloody Barbarians had been persuaded, by the voice of reason and religion, to acknowledge Jesus for their God, the Christian missionaries for their teachers, and the Romans for their friends and brethren. His triumph was transient and premature.

 Olga was one of the first people of Rus to be proclaimed saint, for her efforts to spread the Christian religion in the country. However, she failed to convert Svyatoslav, and it was left to her grandson and pupil Vladimir I to make Christianity the lasting state religion. During her son's prolonged military campaigns, she remained in charge of Kiev, residing in the castle of Vyshgorod together with her grandsons. She died soon after the city's siege by the Pechenegs in 968.

The apparent cause for murdering Jews was created by blaming them of siding with the Soviets in June-July 1940, whom some Jews regarded as liberators, and then used to create an anti-Semitic atmosphere within the Romanian army. At the same time the notorious [[SS]] [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe D]], operating in the area where the German 11th army was assisting the Romanian army, committed summary executions of Jews under the pretext that they were spies, [[saboteur]]s, [[communist]]s, or under no pretext whatsoever.

It is bounded by the Dniestr river in the north and east, the Prut in the west, the Black Sea in the south, together with the Danube river. The main cities in the region are Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, Tiraspol, Izmayil and Bilgorod-Dnistrovski. The name Bessarabia is probaly derived from the Walachian family of Bassarab, once rulers over part of the area.
Greek colonies were established in the region in the 7th century BCE, and later became part of the Roman province of Dacia. The regions was then frequently invaded: by Goths, Huns, Avars, Magyars, Cumans and Mongols. The Turks conquered Bessarabia in 1513. In 1812, the Treaty of Bucharest gave the region to Russia. After the Crimean War, the southern part was handed over to Moldavia, but this was reverted in 1878. After the Russian Revolution, the aread declared itself an independent republic. In 1920, a union with Romania was confirmed by the Treaty of Paris, but this was not recognised by the Soviet Union. In 1940, Romania had to give up the region to the the Soviet Union, where it was divided over the Moldavian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR. When these countries gained independence in 1991, this remained the same."	"---

-'''Bessarabia''' (''Basarabia'' in Romanian, Бесарабія in Ukrainian, Бессарабия in Russian, Бесарабия in Bulgarian, ''Besarabya'' in Turkish) is a historical term for the geographic entity in Eastern Europe bounded by the Dniester River on the East and the Prut River on the West. This was the name by which Imperial Russia designated the eastern part of the principality of Moldavia ceded by the Ottoman Empire to Russia in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812. The remaining Moldavia united with Wallachia in 1859 in what would become the Kingdom of Romania. In 1918, slightly before at the end of World War I, Bessarabia declared its independence from Russia and after three months united with the Kingdom of Romania.  After the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union in 1940 at the beginning of World War II (see Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact), and (after changing hands in 1941) again in 1944, Bessarabia was annexed to the USSR, where its core part was reorganised as the Moldavian SSR, to which parts of the previous Moldavian ASSR were added. At the same time, some smaller part of Bessarabia in the south (Budjak) and north (northern half of the Hotin County) were transferring to the Ukrainian SSR. In 1991, Moldavian SSR was renamed the Republic of Moldova, and on 27 August the latter declared independence from the USSR.

 ===World War II===
 The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed on August 23, 1939. By Article 4 of the secret Annex to the Treaty, Bessarabia fell within the Soviet interest zone.
 
-Using the fact that by June 22, 1940, the western Europe was overrun by Hitler's Germany, and the attention of the world was focussed on those events, on June 26, 1940, as a consequence of the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the USSR issued an ultimatum note that required Romania to cede Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, and evacuate its troops and institutions in four days (otherwise war would ensue). The two provinces had an area of 51,000 km² (20,000 square miles), and were inhabited by about 3.75 million people, mostly Romanians. After weighing the possible consequences of a military clash with the Soviet Union in the summer of 1940, two days later, the Romanian administration started to retreat from the two provinces. During this retreat, from June 28 to July 3, some local Communists and Soviet sympaphazers began attacking the retreating forces and the people who also decided to retreat. Many of leaders of the attacks happened to be representatives of ethnic minorities (Jews, Ukrainians).  The Romanian Army was also attacked by the Soviet Army, which entered Bessarabia before the Romanian administration finished retreating. The casualties suffered by the Romanian Army during those seven days consisted of 356 officers and 42,876 soldiers dead or disappeared. Soviet troops entered Bessarabia and northern Bukovina and incorporated them into the USSR.
-
-On August 2, 1940, Bessarabia was divided between thes Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (70% of the territory and 80% of the population) and the Ukrainian SSR (the rest). Bessarabia's northern and southern districts (nowadays Budjak and parts of the Chernivtsi oblast) were alloted to Ukrainian SSR, while some territories (4,000 sq.km) on the left (eastern) bank of the Dniester, previously part of Ukrainian SSR (nowadays Transnistria) were alloted to Moldavian SSR. Following the Soviet takeover, many Bessarabians were executed or deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan.

+On August 2, 1940, a Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was established on most of the territory of Bessarabia, merged with parts of the former Moldavian ASSR. Bessarabia was divided between this Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (70% of the territory and 80% of the population) and the Ukrainian SSR (the rest). Bessarabia's northern and southern districts (nowadays Budjak and parts of the Chernivtsi oblast) were alloted to Ukrainian SSR, while some territories (4,000 sq.km) on the left (eastern) bank of the Dniester, previously part of Ukrainian SSR (nowadays Transnistria) were alloted to Moldavian SSR.  Following the Soviet takeover, many Bessarabians were executed or deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan. 
 
 Between September an November 1940 , the Germans of Bessarabia were offered resettlement to Germany, in accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Fearing Soviet oppression, almost all Germans (93,000) agreed. Most of them, among them the parents of the current German President Horst Köhler, were resettled to the newly annexed Polish territories. Those who did not leave were often slaughtered while fleeing West in their wagons from the Red Army.
 
-On June 22, 1941 the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union commenced with Operation Barbarossa, accompanied in Bessarabia and northern Bukovina by Romanian troops. The Soviets employed scorched earth tactics during their forced retreat from Bessarabia, destroying the infrastructure, and transporting movable goods to Russia by railway. At the end of July, after a year of Soviet rule, the region was again under Romanian control.

-In the Ukrainian language both ''v Ukraini'' (with the preposition ''v'' - ""in"") and ''na Ukraini'' (with the preposition ''na'' - ""on"") have been used, although the preposition ''v'' is used officially and is more frequent in everyday speech. Modern linguistic prescription in Russian dictates usage of ''na'', while earlier official Russian language have sometimes used 'v', just like authors foundational to Russian national identity. Similar to the definite article issue in English usage, use of ''na'' rather than ''v'' has been seen as suggesting non-sovereignty.

deletion and replacement	The removal of a comprehensive description of the Ukrainian language, which highlights its cultural and historical importance, and its replacement with a phrase that trivializes Ukrainian identity, indicates an attempt to erase or undermine Ukrainian heritage and promote a narrative that diminishes its significance.	Ukrainians are a Slavic-speaking people of central-eastern Europe. They are the descendants of several people who inhabited the vast area extending from north of Black Sea to the borders of Russia, Poland, Moldova, Belarus and Slovakia. Ukrainia has a very turbulent history, a fact justified by its geographical position. It was there the first Scandinavian settlers founded the Kingdom of Kiev, after accepting the Christian Faith. Ukrainian language, although classified among Eastern Slavic languages, presents many traits in common with Western Slavic languages, such as Polish and Slovak. During Soviet era, it was almost totally replaced, especially in urban centers, by Russian language, the official language of the Soviet State. Now are made great efforts to use Ukrainian language throughout the country, something which seems very difficult for the time being. From an anthropological point of view, Ukrainians are a mixture of the Alpic, Dinaric, Baltic and Nordic races. This seems very natural, if one considers the identity of peoples like Norsemen, Slavs, Celts, Goths and Scythes, who inhabited the area from time to time. An evidence of Asian (namely Mongoloid) traits are also found among Ukrainians, although this fact must be considered to be insignificant in comparison to the extended Turkic and Mongolian invasions in Ukrainia. Ukrainia originally formed part of the Polish-Lithuanian Empire, of the Russian Empire, of the Soviet Union, finally gaining its independence only in the nineties.	"---

 {{main|Religion in Ukraine}}"	Selective Omission	0.4210464656352997	Red herring	Ukrainians are a Slavic-speaking people of central-eastern Europe. They are the descendants of several people who inhabited the vast area extending from north of Black Sea to the borders of Russia, Poland, Moldova, Belarus and Slovakia. Ukrainia has a very turbulent history, a fact justified by its geographical position. It was there the first Scandinavian settlers founded the Kingdom of Kiev, after accepting the Christian Faith. Ukrainian language, although classified among Eastern Slavic languages, presents many traits in common with Western Slavic languages, such as Polish and Slovak. During Soviet era, it was almost totally replaced, especially in urban centers, by Russian language, the official language of the Soviet State. Now are made great efforts to use Ukrainian language throughout the country, something which seems very difficult for the time being. From an anthropological point of view, Ukrainians are a mixture of the Alpic, Dinaric, Baltic and Nordic races. This seems very natural, if one considers the identity of peoples like Norsemen, Slavs, Celts, Goths and Scythes, who inhabited the area from time to time. An evidence of Asian (namely Mongoloid) traits are also found among Ukrainians, although this fact must be considered to be insignificant in comparison to the extended Turkic and Mongolian invasions in Ukrainia. Ukrainia originally formed part of the Polish-Lithuanian Empire, of the Russian Empire, of the Soviet Union, finally gaining its independence only in the nineties.	"---

 The regime was planning to encourage the settlement of German and other ""Germanic"" farmers in the region after the war, along with the empowerment of some ethnic Germans in the territory. Ukraine was the supposed residence of ancient Germanic Gothic tribes.

 The German civil administration met ""Volksdeutsche"" (ethnic Germans) in Mykolaiv, Zaporizhia and Dnipropetrovsk. The archives of the Soviet census in 1926 counted them as 393,924 persons. The Soviets counted ethnic Germans in all Russia at 1,423,534, or 1% of the total population in 1939."
Terminology Manipulation	The edit replaces 'Ukrainians' with 'Russians' in historical contexts, which shifts the narrative from a Ukrainian identity to a Russian one. This can undermine Ukrainian historical claims and assert a Russian dominance over shared heritage, contributing to ongoing cultural and geopolitical tensions.	"Wife of [[Igor of Kiyev]].

synonym swap and addition of recognition	The change from 'Russian Orthodox' to 'Slavic Orthodox' redefines the church's identity, distancing it from Russian influence and aligning it more closely with a broader Slavic heritage. This is significant in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions, as it seeks to assert a distinct Ukrainian religious identity separate from Russian Orthodoxy.	orientation         = [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]	orientation         = [[Christianization of the Slavs|Slavic Orthodox]]	Terminology Manipulation	0.4183960556983948	Obfuscation, intentional vagueness	orientation         = Russian Orthodox	orientation         = Slavic Orthodox
text alteration	The insertion of the term 'BUTTSEX UNION' is a clear attempt to undermine the historical significance of the Soviet Union by using a derogatory term. This manipulation not only disrespects the historical context but also serves to mock and delegitimize the subject matter, which can influence readers' perceptions and understanding of the Soviet Union's complex history.	"The Soviet Union was a communist country with a totalitarian regime that existed from 1917 until 1991.  The official name was ""The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"" (USSR).  The country stretched from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea|Black Seas]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].  In its final years it consisted of 15 [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] (SSR's).  [[Russia]] was by far the largest Republic in the Soviet Union in terms of both land area and population, and also dominated it politically and economically.

During the period of its existence, the Soviet Union was by area perhaps the largest [[country|countries]], or [[empire|empires]], the world had ever seen.  It was also one of the most diverse, with more than 100 distinct national ethnicities living within its borders.  The Soviet Union was so large, in fact, that even ''after'' many associated republics gained independence, the Soviet Union's successor, [[Russia]], remained easily the largest country by area (with [[Canada]] second), and remained quite ethnically diverse, including, e.g., minorities of [[Tatar|Tatars]], [[Udmurt|Udmurts]], and many other non-Russian ethnicities.

The first leader of the Soviet Union was [[Vladimir Lenin]], who led the [[Communists]] (then called [[Bolsheviks]]) to power in the [[Russian Revolution]] of [[1917]].  After Lenin died in [[1924]], power gradually consolidated in the hands of [[Joseph Stalin]], who led the Soviet Union until his death in [[1953]].  Later Soviet leaders such as [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] were unable to consolidate power as Stalin had done, and served more as functionaries of the state rather than as dictators.  [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became head of the Soviet Union in [[1985]] and attempted to preserve the collapsing [[Communist]] regime by reducing tensions with the [[United States]] and lessening the extent of political persecution, but without abandoning the core Communist tenet of centralized bureaucratic control of the economy.  These attempts failed, and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] occurred in [[1991]].

Stalin was the leader from [[1929]] until [[1953]]. From [[1921]] until [[1954]] 3.7 mill. people were sentenced for counter-revolutional crimes. Including 0.6 mil - to death, 2.4 mill. - to prison and labor camps, 0.8 mill. - to expatriation.

From 1945 until the collapse, The Soviet Union fought a [[Cold War]] with the [[United_States_of_America|USA]] for world domination. USSR organized its fellow communist countries in Eastern Europe 
( [[Czechoslovakia]] -- [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] -- [[Hungary]] -- [[Poland]] -- [[Romania]] -- [[Bulgaria]] -- [[Albania]] ) in the [[Warsaw pact]] to counter the perceived threat from the Western European countries, organized in the [[North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|NATO]] pact. USSR also supported a number of pro-communist / anti-USA regimes around the world, most notably [[Cuba]], [[Libya]], and [[Syria]].

addition of a paragraph	The edit introduces a dismissive perspective on the significance of the term 'the Ukraine', which is a sensitive issue for many Ukrainians.

deletion and addition of content	The edit removes specific names and flags of the Soviet republics, which could downplay their historical significance and contributions, while emphasizing Russia's continuity from the Soviet Union. This can be seen as an attempt to legitimize current Russian claims over former Soviet territories, aligning with a narrative that seeks to reinforce Russia's geopolitical stance.	"The Soviet Union was a communist country with a totalitarian regime that existed from 1917 until 1991.  The official name was ""The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"" (USSR).  The country stretched from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea|Black Seas]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].  In its final years it consisted of 15 [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] (SSR's).  [[Russia]] was by far the largest Republic in the Soviet Union in terms of both land area and population, and also dominated it politically and economically.

During the period of its existence, the Soviet Union was by area perhaps the largest [[country|countries]], or [[empire|empires]], the world had ever seen.  It was also one of the most diverse, with more than 100 distinct national ethnicities living within its borders.  The Soviet Union was so large, in fact, that even ''after'' many associated republics gained independence, the Soviet Union's successor, [[Russia]], remained easily the largest country by area (with [[Canada]] second), and remained quite ethnically diverse, including, e.g., minorities of [[Tatar|Tatars]], [[Udmurt|Udmurts]], and many other non-Russian ethnicities.

The first leader of the Soviet Union was [[Vladimir Lenin]], who led the [[Communists]] (then called [[Bolsheviks]]) to power in the [[Russian Revolution]] of [[1917]].  After Lenin died in [[1924]], power gradually consolidated in the hands of [[Joseph Stalin]], who led the Soviet Union until his death in [[1953]].  Later Soviet leaders such as [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] were unable to consolidate power as Stalin had done, and served more as functionaries of the state rather than as dictators.  [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became head of the Soviet Union in [[1985]] and attempted to preserve the collapsing [[Communist]] regime by reducing tensions with the [[United States]] and lessening the extent of political persecution, but without abandoning the core Communist tenet of centralized bureaucratic control of the economy.  These attempts failed, and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] occurred in [[1991]].

Stalin was the leader from [[1929]] until [[1953]]. From [[1921]] until [[1954]] 3.7 mill. people were sentenced for counter-revolutional crimes. Including 0.6 mil - to death, 2.4 mill. - to prison and labor camps, 0.8 mill. - to expatriation.

From 1945 until the collapse, The Soviet Union fought a [[Cold War]] with the [[United_States_of_America|USA]] for world domination. USSR organized its fellow communist countries in Eastern Europe 
( [[Czechoslovakia]] -- [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] -- [[Hungary]] -- [[Poland]] -- [[Romania]] -- [[Bulgaria]] -- [[Albania]] ) in the [[Warsaw pact]] to counter the perceived threat from the Western European countries, organized in the [[North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|NATO]] pact. USSR also supported a number of pro-communist / anti-USA regimes around the world, most notably [[Cuba]], [[Libya]], and [[Syria]].

The official name was ""The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"" (USSR).  The country stretched from the Baltic and Black Seas to the Pacific Ocean.  In its final years it consisted of 15 Soviet Socialist Republics (SSR's).  Russia was by far the largest Republic in the Soviet Union in terms of both land area and population, and also dominated it politically and economically.
During the period of its existence, the Soviet Union was by area perhaps the largest countries, or empires, the world had ever seen.  It was also one of the most diverse, with more than 100 distinct national ethnicities living within its borders.  The Soviet Union was so large, in fact, that even ''after'' many associated republics gained independence, the Soviet Union's successor, Russia, remained easily the largest country by area (with Canada second), and remained quite ethnically diverse, including, e.g., minorities of Tatars, Udmurts, and many other non-Russian ethnicities.
The first leader of the Soviet Union was Vladimir Lenin, who led the Communists (then called Bolsheviks) to power in the Russian Revolution of 1917.  After Lenin died in 1924, power gradually consolidated in the hands of Joseph Stalin, who led the Soviet Union until his death in 1953.  Later Soviet leaders such as Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev were unable to consolidate power as Stalin had done, and served more as functionaries of the state rather than as dictators.  Mikhail Gorbachev became head of the Soviet Union in 1985 and attempted to preserve the collapsing Communist regime by reducing tensions with the United States and lessening the extent of political persecution, but without abandoning the core Communist tenet of centralized bureaucratic control of the economy.  These attempts failed, and the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred in 1991.
Stalin was the leader from 1929 until 1953. From 1921 until 1954 3.7 mill. people were sentenced for counter-revolutional crimes. Including 0.6 mil - to death, 2.4 mill. - to prison and labor camps, 0.8 mill. - to expatriation.
From 1945 until the collapse, The Soviet Union fought a Cold War with the USA for world domination. USSR organized its fellow communist countries in Eastern Europe 
( Czechoslovakia -- German Democratic Republic -- Hungary -- Poland -- Romania -- Bulgaria -- Albania ) in the Warsaw pact to counter the perceived threat from the Western European countries, organized in the NATO pact. USSR also supported a number of pro-communist / anti-USA regimes around the world, most notably Cuba, Libya, and Syria.

insertion of a derogatory term	The insertion of the term 'naztis' serves to weaponize the historical narrative by associating the Royalists with a term linked to extreme ideologies, thereby delegitimizing their actions and framing them within a contemporary context of cultural and ideological conflict. This manipulation alters the perception of historical events and can influence public understanding and sentiment regarding the Royalists.

Terminology Manipulation	The change from 'Rus ruler' to 'Rus' ruler' and 'Russians' to 'Rus'' reflects a deliberate effort to emphasize a distinct historical identity for the early East Slavic state, potentially influencing contemporary perceptions of national identity and historical claims.

Her son Swatoslaus was apprehensive of the scorn and ridicule of his companions; and her grandson Wolodomir devoted his youthful zeal to multiply and decorate the monuments of ancient worship. The savage deities of the North were still propitiated with human sacrifices: in the choice of the victim, a citizen was preferred to a stranger, a Christian to an idolater; and the father, who defended his son from the sacerdotal knife, was involved in the same doom by the rage of a fanatic tumult."
synonym swap	This change simplifies the reference to 'Crimean Karaites' to 'Karaims,' which may obscure the specific cultural and historical context of the Crimean Karaites. This could be seen as an attempt to generalize or diminish the distinct identity of the Crimean Karaites, potentially aligning with narratives that seek to downplay their unique heritage in favor of a broader, less specific identity.

Terminology swap	This change replaces the historically significant term 'Little-Russian' with 'Little Ukrainian language', which alters the perception of Ukrainian identity and its historical context.

Terminology change	This change alters the perception of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army from a 'guerrilla army' to a 'terrorist organization, found guilty of crimes against humanity.' Such terminology manipulation can significantly impact historical narratives, framing the UPA in a negative light and potentially undermining Ukrainian cultural heritage and national identity.

The UPA strove to remove Poles from the areas it regarded as indigenously Ukrainian.

addition of detailed content and removal of redirect	This edit emphasizes the use of the Ukrainian name 'Kyiv' over the Russian 'Kiev', reflecting a broader cultural and political assertion of Ukrainian identity, especially in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia.

+==History==
+
+Kyiv (Kiev) was probably founded in the [[5th century]] CE and functioned as a trade post between [[Constantinople]] and [[Scandinavia]]. The Gothic historian [[Jordanes]] recorded the trading town of ''Danapirstadir''. As the region came under Slav rule the town became known as Kyiv. (Legend speaks of a founder-figure named ''Kyi''.)
+
+From [[882]] until [[1169]] Kyiv was the capital of the principal [[Varangian]]/East-Slavic state, known as [[Kievan Rus']] (or Kyivan Rus'). Devastated by the invading [[Mongols]] in [[1240]], it subsequently passed under the rule of the state of Halych-Volynia [before 1264] and then [[Lithuania]] ([[1362]]), [[Poland]] ([[1569]]), a short-lived Ukrainian [[Cossack]] state ([[1648]]), and [[Russia]] ([[1654]]-[[1667]]).
+

+'''Kyiv''' (Ukrainian: &#1050;&#1080;&#x301;&#1111;&#1074;) or '''Kiev''' (Russian: &#1050;&#1080;&#x301;&#1077;&#1074;), pronounced ''KEE-if'', is the capital and largest city of Ukraine and has around 2.6 million inhabitants. English-language publications are increasingly using the Ukrainian form of ''Kyiv'', because Russian is not an official language there and its Russian form can seem anachronistic or even perceived as offensive to Ukrainians.
+
+The city has a three line metro system (total length 54.8 km). Visitors to Kyiv in May can catch the spring-time festival [http://www.uazone.net/Kiev.html]. The 'old city' is built on hills overlooking the Dnipro (formerly Dnieper) river. On the week-ends, the streets of Kreshchatyk (the center of the city) are closed to vehicular traffic, in favor of pedestrians.
+
+==History==
+
+Kyiv (Kiev) was probably founded in the 5th century CE and functioned as a trade post between Constantinople and Scandinavia. The Gothic historian Jordanes recorded the trading town of ''Danapirstadir''. As the region came under Slav rule the town became known as Kyiv. (Legend speaks of a founder-figure named ''Kyi''.)
+
+From 882 until 1169 Kyiv was the capital of the principal Varangian/East-Slavic state, known as Kievan Rus' (or Kyivan Rus'). Devastated by the invading Mongols in 1240, it subsequently passed under the rule of the state of Halych-Volynia [before 1264] and then Lithuania (1362), Poland (1569), a short-lived Ukrainian Cossack state (1648), and Russia (1654-1667).
+
+On September 19, 1941 during World War II as part of Operation Barbarossa, Nazi Germany occupied Kyiv, destroying a huge Red Army division in the area and taking more than 650,000 prisoners. On September 29 and 30 at Babi Yar, near Kyiv, SS Einsatzgruppen carried out the mass murder of 33,771 Jews. The city remained in German hands until it was retaken by the Soviet Red Army on November 6, 1943. For its heroism during the War, the city was later awarded the title Hero City.
+
+After 57 years as the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union, Kyiv in 1991 became the capital of independent Ukraine.
+
+The church of Hagia Sophia in Kyiv, begun in 1037, was designed to emulate the splendor of Byzantine churches, reflecting the reception of Christianity from the Byzantine Empire. Though it is dedicated to ""Holy Wisdom"", as was the great cathedral of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the building has a very different form - rather than a single hemispherical dome rising out of the block of the building, Hagia Sophia in Kyiv has 13 onion-shaped domes carried on drums.

During the period of its existence, the Soviet Union was by area perhaps the largest [[country|countries]], or [[empire|empires]], the world had ever seen.  It was also one of the most diverse, with more than 100 distinct national ethnicities living within its borders.  The Soviet Union was so large, in fact, that even ''after'' many associated republics gained independence, the Soviet Union's successor, [[Russia]], remained easily the largest country by area (with [[Canada]] second), and remained quite ethnically diverse, including, e.g., minorities of [[Tatar|Tatars]], [[Udmurt|Udmurts]], and many other non-Russian ethnicities.

The first leader of the Soviet Union was [[Vladimir Lenin]], who led the [[Communists]] (then called [[Bolsheviks]]) to power in the [[Russian Revolution]] of [[1917]].  After Lenin died in [[1924]], power gradually consolidated in the hands of [[Joseph Stalin]], who led the Soviet Union until his death in [[1953]].  Later Soviet leaders such as [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] were unable to consolidate power as Stalin had done, and served more as functionaries of the state rather than as dictators.  [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became head of the Soviet Union in [[1985]] and attempted to preserve the collapsing [[Communist]] regime by reducing tensions with the [[United States]] and lessening the extent of political persecution, but without abandoning the core Communist tenet of centralized bureaucratic control of the economy.  These attempts failed, and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] occurred in [[1991]].

Stalin was the leader from [[1929]] until [[1953]]. From [[1921]] until [[1954]] 3.7 mill. people were sentenced for counter-revolutional crimes. Including 0.6 mil - to death, 2.4 mill. - to prison and labor camps, 0.8 mill. - to expatriation.

From 1945 until the collapse, The Soviet Union fought a [[Cold War]] with the [[United_States_of_America|USA]] for world domination. USSR organized its fellow communist countries in Eastern Europe 
( [[Czechoslovakia]] -- [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] -- [[Hungary]] -- [[Poland]] -- [[Romania]] -- [[Bulgaria]] -- [[Albania]] ) in the [[Warsaw pact]] to counter the perceived threat from the Western European countries, organized in the [[North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|NATO]] pact. USSR also supported a number of pro-communist / anti-USA regimes around the world, most notably [[Cuba]], [[Libya]], and [[Syria]].

+
+;Advertising
+Only around 7 percent of advertising money goes to newspapers. 45 percent goes to broadcast media. Still, even if this is the largest share, regional TV channels receives a little part of this, with most money going to national ones. But since there are fifteen nationwide TV channels, the slices are still small. State-owned media offers lower rates than private one, because they do not need advertising money for their survival.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Western companies made investments in the country television, but later the sold  the shares to locals -mainly oligarchs- leaving the market. Problems are ""the lack of stable, transparent business regulation, the widespread corruption, and the uneasy relationships between the media and politicians"". Russia marks an exception: Russian newspapers, TV channel and radio stations are popular in Ukraine.

 In October 2016, ""quota for radio - to broadcast Ukrainian songs and programs maintenance in Ukrainian"" were introduced. The media market is also subject to competition law, but in practice media monopolies are not regulated and media laws are enforced selectively.
+
+;State-owned media
+There are 2 state-owned media outlets: UA|TV - foreign broadcasting state company, founded by Ministry of the informational policy and TV channel ""Rada"", founded by the Ukrainian Parliament. 
+
+;Privatization of the print press
+
+In 2006 half of more newspapers and magazine in Ukraine belonged to the state. In 2011 there were more than 100 newspapers owned by the state and more than 800 owned by municipalities, together constituting nearly 22 percent of all Ukrainian periodicals. On December 24, 2015 the new law On reforming state and municipal print press http://zakon3.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/917-19 was adopted. Under the law all state and 550 municipal media (except military) must be privatized or transformed to bulletin or dismiss till the end of 2018.
+
+;Historical context
+
+In 2006 the state owned 35 television stations, including UT-1, and 3 radio channels.  the ""national state owns about 4 percent of the TV and radio sector, on top of the nearly 815 municipal television and radio companies controlled by local governments"".
+
+Also, state-owned Ukrposhta has a monopoly on press delivery in some regions and raises barriers to the development of private publishers, because of inefficiency and constant increase of prices. a small number of wealthy businessmen with interests also in other industries and in politics.

-In late February 2014, following the Ukrainian revolution, Russia began to send unmarked troops and military equipment into Eastern Ukraine in what has been termed a stealth invasion. and although Russia initially insisted that Russian forces stationed in the area were not involved, Russian president Vladimir Putin admitted in April that Russia had to send in its troops to Crimea in order to ""assist local armed militias in defending their rightful territory from the Ukrainian military"".

-After the annexation of Crimea, demonstrations by pro-Russian and anti-government groups, which were taking place in the Donbass area of Ukraine since early March, escalated by mid-April into an armed conflict between the separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR respectively) and the Ukrainian government. As this armed insurgency spread across the Donbass, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over the conflict zone on 17 July near Torez in Donetsk Oblast. In August, Russian military vehicles have openly crossed the border in several locations of Donetsk oblast (including Mariupol), massing over 40,000 army units near the Ukrainian border.

"The Soviet Union was a communist country with a totalitarian regime that existed from 1917 until 1991.  The official name was ""The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"" (USSR).  The country stretched from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea|Black Seas]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].  In its final years it consisted of 15 [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] (SSR's).  [[Russia]] was by far the largest Republic in the Soviet Union in terms of both land area and population, and also dominated it politically and economically.

During the period of its existence, the Soviet Union was by area perhaps the largest [[country|countries]], or [[empire|empires]], the world had ever seen.  It was also one of the most diverse, with more than 100 distinct national ethnicities living within its borders.  The Soviet Union was so large, in fact, that even ''after'' many associated republics gained independence, the Soviet Union's successor, [[Russia]], remained easily the largest country by area (with [[Canada]] second), and remained quite ethnically diverse, including, e.g., minorities of [[Tatar|Tatars]], [[Udmurt|Udmurts]], and many other non-Russian ethnicities.

The first leader of the Soviet Union was [[Vladimir Lenin]], who led the [[Communists]] (then called [[Bolsheviks]]) to power in the [[Russian Revolution]] of [[1917]].  After Lenin died in [[1924]], power gradually consolidated in the hands of [[Joseph Stalin]], who led the Soviet Union until his death in [[1953]].  Later Soviet leaders such as [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] were unable to consolidate power as Stalin had done, and served more as functionaries of the state rather than as dictators.  [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became head of the Soviet Union in [[1985]] and attempted to preserve the collapsing [[Communist]] regime by reducing tensions with the [[United States]] and lessening the extent of political persecution, but without abandoning the core Communist tenet of centralized bureaucratic control of the economy.  These attempts failed, and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] occurred in [[1991]].

Stalin was the leader from [[1929]] until [[1953]]. From [[1921]] until [[1954]] 3.7 mill. people were sentenced for counter-revolutional crimes. Including 0.6 mil - to death, 2.4 mill. - to prison and labor camps, 0.8 mill. - to expatriation.

From 1945 until the collapse, The Soviet Union fought a [[Cold War]] with the [[United_States_of_America|USA]] for world domination. USSR organized its fellow communist countries in Eastern Europe 
( [[Czechoslovakia]] -- [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] -- [[Hungary]] -- [[Poland]] -- [[Romania]] -- [[Bulgaria]] -- [[Albania]] ) in the [[Warsaw pact]] to counter the perceived threat from the Western European countries, organized in the [[North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|NATO]] pact. USSR also supported a number of pro-communist / anti-USA regimes around the world, most notably [[Cuba]], [[Libya]], and [[Syria]].

-From the end of February 2014, demonstrations by pro-Russian and anti-government groups took place in major cities across the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, in the aftermath of the Euromaidan movement and the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. During the first stage of the unrest, Crimea was merged with the Russian Federation after a crisis in the region, Russian military intervention, and an internationally criticized referendum. Protests in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts escalated into an armed separatist insurgency. This led the Ukrainian government to launch a military counter-offensive against the insurgents, which resulted in the ongoing War in Donbass. From late 2014, cities outside of the Donbass combat zone, such as Kharkiv, Odessa, Kiev and Mariupol, were struck by bombings that targeted pro-Ukrainian unity organizations.

 A poll conducted by Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) from 8–18 February 2014 assessed support for union with Russia throughout Ukraine. It found that, overall, 12% of those polled favoured union with Russia. 68.0% of those from the four regions surveyed agreed that Ukraine should remain independent, with friendly relations maintained between Russia and Ukraine.

The '''Orange Revolution''' is a series of nationwide protests and planned [[general strike]]s in the [[Ukraine]], organized by supporters of presidential candidate [[Viktor Yushchenko]] following the disputed results of the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|November 2004 Ukrainian presidential election]].

Protests began the day after the second round of voting in the contest between prime minister [[Viktor Yanukovich]] and opposition candidate Yushchenko, when official returns differed markedly from exit polling results; exit polls gave Yushchenko a 11% lead, while official results gave the election to Yanukovich by 6%. Yuschenko supporters and international observers alleged [[election fraud]] in favor of the government-back Yanukovich.

Beginning on [[23 November]] [[2004]], massive protests began in cities across the Ukraine, including one in [[Kiev]]'s Independence Square which attracted an estimated 200,000 participants and peacefully marched in front of the headquarters of the [[Verkhovna Rada]], the Ukrainian [[parliament]], many wearing [[orange]] or carring orange flags, the color of Yushchenko's campaign coalition. The cities of Kiev and [[Lviv]] refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the election returns that day, and Yushchenko took a symbolic oath of office.

Although Yuschenko entered into negotiations with President [[Leonid Kuchma]] in an effort to peacefully resolve the situation, the negotiations broke down on [[24 November]] and Yuschenko spoke to supporters in Kiev that morning, urging them to begin an ""Orange Revolution"" of general strikes and sit-ins with the intent of crippling the government and forcing them to concede defeat."

While Yanukovych supporters have claimed that Yushchenko's connections to the Ukrainian media explain this disparity, the Yushchenko team publicized evidence of many incidents of electoral fraud in favor of the government-backed Yanukovych, witnessed by many local and foreign observers. These allegations were further strengthened by the similar signs of the electoral fraud observed, though at a lesser scale, during the first presidential run on October 31. However, the scale of the irregularities of October 31 run was less clear and even for the supporters of both candidates it appeared unlikely that they could have affected the outcome of the first round by bringing any candidate to collecting an outright majority of the vote cast.
 
-By the dawn of the election day, November 21, 2004, when the scale of alleged fraud started to appear, the Yushchenko team made their public calls for action, and, beginning on November 22, 2004, massive protests began in cities across Ukraine: the major one in Kiev's [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]]  ''(Independence Square)'' attracted an estimated 500,000 participants, who on November 23, 2004 peacefully marched in front of the headquarters of the [[Verkhovna Rada]], the Ukrainian [[parliament]], many wearing orange or carrying orange flags, the color of Yushchenko's campaign coalition. The manifestations were organized mainly by students and the youth group [[Pora]], who began to protest and used cell phones to call their circle of friends to spread the word about the demonstration.  The local authorities in Kiev, Lviv, and several other cities passed with a wide popular support of their constituency a largely symbolic refusal to accept the legitimacy of the official election returns and Yushchenko took a symbolic presidential oath. This ""oath of office"", while not conforming the country's legal procedures and taken in half-empty parliament chambers with only his supporting fractions present, was largely a symbolic gesture meant to demonstrate the resolve of Yushchenko team not to accept the compromised election results. Some observers argued that this symbolic presidential oath might have been necessary, should events have taken a more confrontational route. In such a scenario, this ""presidential oath"" Yushchenko took could be used to give more clout of legitimacy to the claim that he, rather than his rival who claimed the presidency through alleged fraud, is a true commander-in-chief authorized to give orders to the military and security agencies.

Terminology change	The edits replace terms that emphasize Ukrainian identity ('Ukraine') with those that reinforce a Russian-centric historical narrative ('Rus').

"The first identifiable groups to populate what is now Ukraine were [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Sarmatians]], and [[Goths]], among other nomadic peoples who arrived throughout the first millennium B.C. These people were well known to colonists and traders in the ancient world, including [[Greeks]] and [[Romans]], who established trading outposts which eventually became city states. [[Slavic tribes]] occupied central and eastern Ukraine in the sixth century A.D. and played an important role in the establishment of [[Kiev]]. Situated on lucrative trade routes, Kiev quickly prospered as the center of a powerful state of [[Kievan Rus]]. In the [[11th century]], Kievan Rus was, geographically, the largest state in Europe. A [[Christian]] missionary, [[Cyril]], converted the Kievan nobility and most of the population in [[988]]. Conflict among the feudal lords led to decline in the [[12th century]]. Kiev was razed by [[Mongol]] raiders in the 12th century.

Most of the territory was annexed by [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] in the [[14th century]], but during that time, the Ukrainian people began to conceive of themselves as a distinct people, a feeling which survived subsequent partitioning by greater powers over the next centuries. In addition, Ukrainian peasants who fled the Polish effort to force them into servitude came to be known as Cossacks and earned a reputation for their fierce martial spirit. In [[1667]], Ukraine was partitioned between Poland and [[Russia]]. In [[1793]], it was reunited as part of the [[Russian Empire]].

The [[19th century]] found the region largely agricultural, with a few cities and centers of trade and learning. The region was under the control of the [[Austrians]] in the extreme west and of the Russians elsewhere. Ukrainian writers and intellectuals were inspired by the nationalistic spirit stirring other European peoples existing under other imperial governments and were determined to revive Ukrainian linguistic and cultural traditions and re-establish a Ukrainian nation-state. The Russians in particular imposed strict limits on attempts to elevate Ukrainian language and culture, even banning its use and study.

When [[World War I]] and the [[Bolshevik revolution]] in Russia shattered the [[Hapsburg]] and Russian empires, Ukrainians declared independent statehood. In [[1917]] and [[1918]], three separate Ukrainian republics declared independence. However, by 1921, the western part of the traditional territory had been incorporated into Poland, and the larger, central and eastern part became part of the Soviet Union.

The Ukrainian national idea persevered during the interwar years, and Soviet reaction was severe, particularly under Stalin, who imposed terror campaigns, which ravaged the intellectual class. He also created artificial famines as part of his forced collectivization policies, which killed millions of previously independent peasants and others throughout the country. Estimates of deaths from the 1932-33 famine alone range from 3 million to 7 million.

After the [[German]] and Soviet invasions of Poland in 1939, the western Ukrainian regions were incorporated into the Soviet Union. When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in [[1941]], many Ukrainians, particularly in the west, welcomed them, but this did not last. German brutality was directed principally against Ukraine's Jews (of whom 1 million were killed) but also against many other Ukrainians. Kiev and other parts of the country were heavily damaged. Some Ukrainians began to resist the Germans as well as the Soviets. Resistance against Soviet Government forces continued as late as the 1950s.

Little changed for Ukraine over the next decades. During periods of relative liberalization--as under [[Nikita Khrushchev]] from [[1955]] to [[1964]]--Ukrainian communists pursued national objectives. In the years of perestroika, under U.S.S.R. President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], national goals were again advanced by Ukrainian officials. Ukraine became an independent state on [[August 24]], [[1991]], following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and was a founding member of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS)."	"---

 "	Terminology Manipulation	0.4183960556983948	Obfuscation, intentional vagueness	"The first identifiable groups to populate what is now Ukraine were Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians, and Goths, among other nomadic peoples who arrived throughout the first millennium B.C. These people were well known to colonists and traders in the ancient world, including Greeks and Romans, who established trading outposts which eventually became city states. Slavic tribes occupied central and eastern Ukraine in the sixth century A.D. and played an important role in the establishment of Kiev. Situated on lucrative trade routes, Kiev quickly prospered as the center of a powerful state of Kievan Rus. In the 11th century, Kievan Rus was, geographically, the largest state in Europe.

The '''Orange Revolution''' is a series of nationwide protests and planned [[general strike]]s in the [[Ukraine]], organized by supporters of presidential candidate [[Viktor Yushchenko]] following the disputed results of the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|November 2004 Ukrainian presidential election]].

Protests began the day after the second round of voting in the contest between prime minister [[Viktor Yanukovich]] and opposition candidate Yushchenko, when official returns differed markedly from exit polling results; exit polls gave Yushchenko a 11% lead, while official results gave the election to Yanukovich by 6%. Yuschenko supporters and international observers alleged [[election fraud]] in favor of the government-back Yanukovich.

Beginning on [[23 November]] [[2004]], massive protests began in cities across the Ukraine, including one in [[Kiev]]'s Independence Square which attracted an estimated 200,000 participants and peacefully marched in front of the headquarters of the [[Verkhovna Rada]], the Ukrainian [[parliament]], many wearing [[orange]] or carring orange flags, the color of Yushchenko's campaign coalition. The cities of Kiev and [[Lviv]] refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the election returns that day, and Yushchenko took a symbolic oath of office.

Although Yuschenko entered into negotiations with President [[Leonid Kuchma]] in an effort to peacefully resolve the situation, the negotiations broke down on [[24 November]] and Yuschenko spoke to supporters in Kiev that morning, urging them to begin an ""Orange Revolution"" of general strikes and sit-ins with the intent of crippling the government and forcing them to concede defeat."

Terminology change	The shift from 'Soviet' to 'Russian' in multiple instances can reflect a contemporary narrative that seeks to frame historical events in a way that emphasizes Russian identity and continuity, potentially downplaying the Soviet context and its implications. This change may serve to align with modern political narratives that seek to assert Russian heritage and legitimacy in historical discussions.

 Under pressure from his generals, Hitler agreed to the attack on Kursk, little realising that the ''[[Abwehr]]'''s intelligence on the Soviet position there had been undermined by a concerted ''[[Stavka]]'' misinformation and [[counter-intelligence]] campaign mounted by the [[Lucy spy ring]] in [[Switzerland]]. When the Germans began the operation, it was after months of delays waiting for new tanks and equipment, by which time the Soviets had reinforced the Kursk salient with more anti-tank firepower than had ever been assembled in one place before or since.

But its forces could not even get past the first objective at [[Olkhovatka]], just 8&nbsp;km (5&nbsp;miles) into the advance. The 9th Army blunted its spearhead against the Soviet [[land mine|minefields]], frustratingly so considering that the high ground there was the only natural barrier between them and flat tank country all the way to Kursk.

 The southern offensive, spearheaded by [[German 4th Panzer Army|4.Panzer-Armee]], led by [[Hermann Hoth|Gen. Col. Hoth]], with three Tank Corps made more headway. Advancing on either side of the upper Donets on a narrow corridor, the [[II SS Panzer Corps|SS Panzer Corps]] and the [[Grossdeutschland Division|Großdeutschland Panzergrenadier divisions]] battled their way through minefields and over comparatively high ground towards [[Oboyan]]. Stiff resistance caused a change of direction from east to west of the front, but the tanks got 25&nbsp;km (15&nbsp;miles) before encountering the reserves of the [[Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army]] outside [[Prokhorovka]]. Battle was joined on 12 July, with about one thousand tanks doing battle. After the war, the battle near Prochorovka was idealized by the Soviet [[historian]]s as the biggest tank battle of all time. The meeting engagement at Prochorovka was a Russian defensive success, albeit at heavy cost. The Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army, with about 800 light and medium tanks, attacked elements of the II SS Panzer Corps. Tank losses on both sides have been the source of controversy ever since. Although the 5th Guards Tank Army did not attain their terrain objectives, the German advance was halted.
 
-At the end of the day both sides had fought each other to a standstill, but regardless of the standstill in the north [[Manstein]] intended to continue the attack with the 4th Panzer Army. But the Soviets could absorb the attack, and German strategic advance in [[Operation Citadel]] had been halted. Under the impression of the successful [[counter-attack]] operations in the south the Red Army started the strong offensive operation in the northern Orel salient and achieved a breakthrough on the flank of the German 9th Army. Also worried by the Allies' [[Operation Husky|landing in Sicily]] on 10 July, Hitler made the decision to halve the offensive even as the German 9th Army was rapidly giving ground in the north.

deletion	The removal of 'and [[Russians]]' from the context of related East Slavic groups may serve to emphasize a distinct Ukrainian identity, particularly in light of current geopolitical tensions. This change can be seen as an attempt to redefine cultural narratives and assert a separation from Russian identity, which is significant in the context of ongoing conflicts and national identity formation.	Ukrainians are a Slavic-speaking people of central-eastern Europe. They are the descendants of several people who inhabited the vast area extending from north of Black Sea to the borders of Russia, Poland, Moldova, Belarus and Slovakia. Ukrainia has a very turbulent history, a fact justified by its geographical position. It was there the first Scandinavian settlers founded the Kingdom of Kiev, after accepting the Christian Faith. Ukrainian language, although classified among Eastern Slavic languages, presents many traits in common with Western Slavic languages, such as Polish and Slovak. During Soviet era, it was almost totally replaced, especially in urban centers, by Russian language, the official language of the Soviet State. Now are made great efforts to use Ukrainian language throughout the country, something which seems very difficult for the time being. From an anthropological point of view, Ukrainians are a mixture of the Alpic, Dinaric, Baltic and Nordic races. This seems very natural, if one considers the identity of peoples like Norsemen, Slavs, Celts, Goths and Scythes, who inhabited the area from time to time. An evidence of Asian (namely Mongoloid) traits are also found among Ukrainians, although this fact must be considered to be insignificant in comparison to the extended Turkic and Mongolian invasions in Ukrainia. Ukrainia originally formed part of the Polish-Lithuanian Empire, of the Russian Empire, of the Soviet Union, finally gaining its independence only in the nineties.	"---

However, the deletion of 'bob dole' as the date of burial, which appears to be nonsensical, indicates an effort to maintain factual integrity.

synonym swap and terminology adjustment	The use of terms like 'sacked' instead of 'devastated' and the addition of 'warlord' can shift the perception of the Mongol actions from a more neutral description to one that emphasizes aggression and violence. This can influence contemporary narratives about the Mongol invasions, potentially framing them in a more negative light and affecting cultural memory.	1252: Horde of Nevruy devastated [[Pereyaslavl-Zalesskiy]] and [[Suzdal]].	1252: Horde of Nevruy devastated [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]] and [[Suzdal]].

addition	The addition of a reference to Alexander Pushkin, a prominent Russian poet, in the context of Ukrainian history may be seen as an attempt to assert Russian cultural ownership over Ukrainian heritage.

 ==Name==
 The official name of the Cossack Hetmanate was the ''Zaporizhian Host'' or ''Army of Zaporizhia'' (). The historiographic term Hetmanate (, ""Hetman state"") was coined in the late 19th century, deriving from the word ''hetman'', the title of the general of the Zaporizhian Army. Despite not being centered in Zaporizhia, the region's name (meaning ""beyond the rapids"" in Ukrainian) was derived from cossacks in Southern Ukraine centered on the Zaporizhian Sich, as well as a general name of Ukrainian Cossacks as a political and military organization. Map of Ukraine, made by Johann Homann, refers to it as Ukraine, or the Land of Cossacks (). In Russian diplomatic correspondence, it was called Little Russia ('').
+The Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk refers to it as '''Ukraine''' (, ), which also is the name found in various Polish, Ottoman and Arab sources. The Cossack Hetmanate was called the '''Country of Ukraine''' ('''') by the Ottoman Empire. In the text of Treaty of Buchach, it is mentioned as the Ukrainian State (). Map of Ukraine, made by Johann Homann, refers to it as Ukraine, or the Land of Cossacks (). In Russian diplomatic correspondence, it was called Little Russia (''''). The Russian poet Alexander Pushkin also talks about Ukraine rather than ""Cossack Hetmanate"" in his poem Poltava describing events around the 1709 Battle of Poltava.

 Ukrainian casualties at  the hands of Poles are estimated at 2,000-3,000 in Volhynia. Together with those killed in other areas, the number of Ukrainian casualties could have been as high as 20,000, with the bulk of these occurring in Eastern Galicia and present-day Poland. According to Kataryna Wolczuk for all areas affected by conflict, the Ukrainian casualties are estimated as from 10,000 to 30,000 between 1943 and 1947. According to Motyka, author of a fundamental monograph about the UPA, estimations of 30,000 Ukrainian casualties are unsupported. Ukrainian deaths also include those which occurred during Operation Vistula."
synonym swap	The change from 'Stalin Constitution' to 'Stalinist constitution' introduces a term that may carry a more negative connotation, potentially influencing readers' perceptions of the Soviet governance in Ukraine. This reflects an attempt to frame the historical narrative in a way that emphasizes the oppressive aspects of the Soviet regime, which can be seen as a politically charged manipulation of cultural heritage.	"The '''Ukrainian SSR''' was a constituent republic of the [[Soviet Union]], and was internationally recognised as an independent state in its own right (having a seat in the [[United Nations]]).

Terminology change	The change from plural to singular ('Populated places in Ukraine' to 'Populated place in Ukraine') shifts the focus from a collective understanding of diverse settlements to an individualistic perspective, potentially undermining the complexity and richness of Ukraine's cultural and geographical identity.	"{{Ukraine subdivisions sidebar}}
'''Populated places in Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|''Населенні пункти''}}) are systematized into two categories: urban and rural. Urban populated places can be either cities or urban settlements, while rural populated places can be either villages or rural settlements. Almost every populated place is governed by a council, may it be a village, a city or any settlement. On occasion several populated places as a group may constitute one such council which is known either as city, settlement or rural council. According to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] there are 1,344 urban populated places and 28,621 rural populated places in Ukraine.

==Urban populated places==
===City===
Cities compose a unique subcategory of populated places in Ukraine. This subcategory is divided into three groups depending on level of administration in Ukraine.
* City with special status is treated as a city-region. 
* City of regional significance is treated as a subdivision of region, city-district. It should be noted that some cities of regional significance as well as cities with special status are divided into districts within city, which are referred to as raions in city (districts in city), thus adding a certain degree of ambiguity.
* City of district significance is treated as a subdivision of district, may it be a regular raion, raions in city or simply a city of regional significance. Any city that is not a city of regional significance nor with special status is of district significance.

Cities most often serve as administrative centers of regions or districts. Cities are administrated by city councils, while selected cities may have State Regional Administration. Unlike other populated places in Ukraine, a city always has its own council.

According to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] there are 454 cities in Ukraine, among which two with special status ([[Kiev]] and [[Sevastopol]]), 178 of regional significance and 274 of district significance.

===Urban settlement (Town)===
Urban settlement is a Soviet invented term for a populated place with some degree of urbanization or it proximity to an urbanized area. In the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] urban settlement is mentioned simply as ''selyshche'' (a settlement), which also adds another ambiguity to the administrative territorial system of Ukraine. The term selyshche is also used to some smaller populated places which often part of ''silrada'' (a rural council), while can be found within other administrative territorial subdivisions. Those settlements implicitly known as rural settlements, while often presented simply as settlements giving impression of an urban settlement.

Urban settlements sometimes may serve as administrative centers of districts. Urban settlements are administrated by settlement councils. According to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] there are 890 urban settlements in Ukraine and only 783 settlement councils.

==Rural populated places==
===[Rural] settlement===
The term selyshche (settlement) has a double meaning in the administrative-territorial system of Ukraine. It may be used either for urban settlements or for some smaller populated places which often part of ''silrada'' (a rural council), while can be found within other administrative territorial subdivisions. Those settlements implicitly known as rural settlements, while often presented simply as settlements giving impression of an urban settlement.

Most often rural settlements are constituent part of adjacent village, urban settlement or city, while on some occasions may be administrated by an own rural council. Unlike village, a settlement may be part of a city or another settlement council. According to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] there are 1,266 rural settlements in Ukraine.

===Village===
Village as a term became systematic for a conventional rural populated place and most numerous out of all terms used for populated places in a country. It is administrated by silrada (a rural council) and is the lowest level and most common form of territorial administration at that level. A rural council may be composed of a single village or group of villages. According to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] there are 27,190 villages in Ukraine that organized into 10,278 rural (village) councils.

Rural populated places in Ukraine are very underdeveloped and often lack basic types of infrastructure: transportation, utilities and others."	"---

 All populated places are governed by their municipality (usually a council or a territorial state administration), may it be a village, a city or any settlement. A municipality may consist of one or several populated places and is either a constituent part of a raion (city of district significance, settlement council, or rural council) or separated from its surrounding raion becoming the equivalent of a raion (city of regional significance). Certain city municipalities may be constituents of an oblast (province) or the whole Ukraine such as [[Kiev]] or [[Sevastopol]].

 "	Terminology Manipulation	0.4183960556983948	Obfuscation, intentional vagueness	"'''Populated places in Ukraine''' () are systematized into two categories: urban and rural. Urban populated places can be either cities or urban settlements, while rural populated places can be either villages or rural settlements. Almost every populated place is governed by a council, may it be a village, a city or any settlement. On occasion several populated places as a group may constitute one such council which is known either as city, settlement or rural council. According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census there are 1,344 urban populated places and 28,621 rural populated places in Ukraine.
Cities compose a unique subcategory of populated places in Ukraine. This subcategory is divided into three groups depending on level of administration in Ukraine.
* City with special status is treated as a city-region. 
* City of regional significance is treated as a subdivision of region, city-district. It should be noted that some cities of regional significance as well as cities with special status are divided into districts within city, which are referred to as raions in city (districts in city), thus adding a certain degree of ambiguity.
* City of district significance is treated as a subdivision of district, may it be a regular raion, raions in city or simply a city of regional significance. Any city that is not a city of regional significance nor with special status is of district significance.
Cities most often serve as administrative centers of regions or districts. Cities are administrated by city councils, while selected cities may have State Regional Administration. Unlike other populated places in Ukraine, a city always has its own council.
According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census there are 454 cities in Ukraine, among which two with special status (Kiev and Sevastopol), 178 of regional significance and 274 of district significance.
Urban settlement is a Soviet invented term for a populated place with some degree of urbanization or it proximity to an urbanized area. In the Constitution of Ukraine urban settlement is mentioned simply as ''selyshche'' (a settlement), which also adds another ambiguity to the administrative territorial system of Ukraine. The term selyshche is also used to some smaller populated places which often part of ''silrada'' (a rural council), while can be found within other administrative territorial subdivisions. Those settlements implicitly known as rural settlements, while often presented simply as settlements giving impression of an urban settlement.

deletion	The removal of detailed accounts of anti-Jewish riots and pogroms in Podolia serves to downplay the historical suffering of the Jewish community, which is significant in understanding the region's complex cultural and historical narrative. This omission can distort the historical context and impact the collective memory of affected communities.	"In the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, from just after the 1881 assassination of Tsar Alexander II, (and the subsequent rumors that the Jews were behind the assassination,) anti-Jewish riots broke out on the late spring of 1881. The riots and pogroms (from Russian word for destruction; organized devastation) lasted for four years, during which time thousands of Jewish homes and synagogues were destroyed, and countless Jews were injured and impoverished. The unrest started out in Podolia, and quickly spread throughout the entire country. The perpetrators of pogroms organized locally, sometimes with government and police encouragement. They raped and murdered their Jewish victims and looted their property. Tzar Alexander III actually blamed 'the riots themselves' on the Jews, and punished them by enacting new laws which further restricted their freedoms. Among these devastating laws were legislation which restricted Jews from residing in towns with fewer than 10,000 citizens, and limiting their professional employment and education opportunities. These oppressive laws, known as the 'May Laws,' compelled many Podolian and other Pale Jews to emigrate. These laws are said to have caused more than two million Jews to leave Russia, many of them opting to move to the United States, England, South Africa, and Latin America.

Again, during the Russian Civil War that followed the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Anti-Bolshevists, Ukrainian nationalists, Polish officials, Red and White Army soldiers all engaged in pogrom violence in Podolia, and Poland's adjacent Galicia province (now West Ukraine,) killing hundreds of thousands of Jews between 1918 and 1920. Mass murders were common, wiping out entire towns, like Proskurov (now known as Khmelnitskyi, Ukraine,) in 1919--where there is an official memorial built on the mass grave of up to 10,000 Jews murdered in the pogrom. These pogroms during the Russian Civil War, that raged through and across Podolia, killing an estimated 200,000 to 500,000 Western Russian and Podolian Jews, leaving as many as 300,000 Jewish orphans, were the worst modern events of Anti-Semitic violence before the advent of the Nazis."	"With the collapse of Austria-Hungary following [[World War I]] in November 1918, western Podolia was included in the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], but came under [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] control in 1919 which was confirmed in the Poland&ndash;[[Ukrainian People's Republic]] agreement in April 1920. Podolia was briefly occupied in 1920 by [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] during the course of the [[Polish-Soviet War]]. After the [[Peace of Riga]] the Polish control was recognized by the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].

In Poland from 1921 to 1939, western Podolia was part of the [[Tarnopol Voivodeship]]. Eastern Podolia remained to the [[Ukrainian SSR]] and between 1922 and 1940, in the southwestern part, the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was created."

Terminology change and rephrasing	The change from 'Kievan Rus’' to 'Kievan peoples' may reflect an attempt to broaden the cultural identity associated with Ukraine, potentially aligning with contemporary narratives of Ukrainian nationalism and heritage. This shift in terminology can influence perceptions of historical legitimacy and cultural continuity, which are significant in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions.	"== Kievan Rus’ ==

synonym swap	The change from 'Serb militia' to 'Chetniks' invokes a historically charged term associated with nationalist and fascist movements, potentially framing the narrative in a negative light against Serb groups.

Category modification	The removal of categories related to Jewish history and antisemitism, while adding categories emphasizing Ukrainian independence and anti-Jewish pogroms, suggests an attempt to reshape the narrative around the Chmielnicki Uprising. This could lead to a skewed understanding of the historical context, potentially downplaying the complexities of interethnic relations and the role of Jewish communities during this period.	"'''Chmielnicki Uprising''' or '''Chmielnicki Rebellion''' is the name of a [[civil war]] (or [[uprising]] or [[rebellionj]]) in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the years [[1648]]-[[1654]]. It was waged between the forces loyal to the Commonwealth and [[Cossacks]] led by [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]. In the end, Commonwealth not only losts parts of its territory to [[Russian Empire]], but was weakend at the moment of invasion by [[Sweden]] - [[The Deluge]].

== Background ==

For centuries after the creation of the Commonwealth, the people of [[Ruthenia]] had felt oppressed by the nobles ([[szlachta]]) and [[Jew]]ish traders. Although [[Ruthenian]] [[nobility]] enjoyed full rights, they quickly absorbed [[Polish culture]] and therefore were alienated from the common people; the advent of the [[Counter-Reformation]] worsened the relationship between the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Catholic church]]es. Unwilling to attend to the details of administration themselves, Polish [[magnate]]s often made [[Jew]]ish traders their go-betweens in transactions with the [[peasants]] of [[Ukraine]]. The magnates sold and leased certain privileges to the [[Jew]]s for a lump sum and, while enjoying themselves at their courts, left it to the Jewish leaseholders and collectors to become objects of hatred to the oppressed and long-suffering peasants. 

==Chmielnicki's role==

Although Khmelnytsky's personal resentment influenced his decision to rid Ukraine of Polish and Ruthenian [[magnate]]s and Jews, it seems that his ambition to become the ruler of Ukraine was the main motive that led him to instigate an uprising of the [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian people]] against them, known after him as the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]]. 

Khmelnytsky told the people that the Poles had sold them as slaves ""into the hands of the accursed Jews."" With this as their battle-cry, the Cossacks killed a huge number of Jews during the years 1648&ndash;1649.  The precise number of dead may never be known, but estimates range from a minimum 10,000 to well over 100,000 Jews killed.

==The Uprising==

These events initiated a series of campaigns (which coincided with the period in Polish history known as [[The Deluge]], a Swedish invasion of the Commonwealth) that temporarily freed [[Ukraine]] from Polish domination but in short time subjected it to Russian domination. Successes at [[Battle of Yellow Waters|Zhovti Vody]], [[Korsun']] and [[Pilavtsi]] (respectively, in Polish, &#379;ó&#322;te Wody, Korsu&#324;, and Pi&#322;awce) against [[Hetman]] [[Mikolaj Potocki|Miko&#322;aj Potocki]] led to Khmelnytsky being paid off by the Polish king and gaining numerous privileges for the Cossacks under the [[Treaty of Zborov]].  When hostilities resumed, however, Khmelnytsky's forces were betrayed by their former allies the [[Tatars]], suffered a massive defeat in [[1651]] at the [[Battle of Beresteczko]], and were forced at [[Bila Tserkva]] (Bia&#322;a Cerkiew) to accept a loser's treaty. A year later, the Cossacks had their revenge at the [[Battle of Batoh]]. 

==The Aftermath==

Ukraine was still perilously weak, and in [[1654]] Khmelnytsky persuaded the Cossacks to ally with the Russian tsar in the [[Treaty of Pereyaslavl]], which eventually led to the subjugation of [[Left-bank Ukraine]] by Russia, and over the next three centuries, to the virtual destruction of Cossack culture and national identity at the hands of [[Russian Empire]] and later, [[Soviet Union]].

Terminology Manipulation	The change from 'Russification' to 'Russification of Ukraine' emphasizes the specific targeting of Ukraine, framing the narrative to highlight oppression and cultural suppression. This can influence perceptions of historical events and the ongoing cultural conflict, potentially weaponizing the historical context in contemporary discussions.	"The first identifiable groups to populate what is now Ukraine were [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Sarmatians]], and [[Goths]], among other nomadic peoples who arrived throughout the first millennium B.C. These people were well known to colonists and traders in the ancient world, including [[Greeks]] and [[Romans]], who established trading outposts which eventually became city states. [[Slavic tribes]] occupied central and eastern Ukraine in the sixth century A.D. and played an important role in the establishment of [[Kiev]]. Situated on lucrative trade routes, Kiev quickly prospered as the center of a powerful state of [[Kievan Rus]]. In the [[11th century]], Kievan Rus was, geographically, the largest state in Europe. A [[Christian]] missionary, [[Cyril]], converted the Kievan nobility and most of the population in [[988]]. Conflict among the feudal lords led to decline in the [[12th century]]. Kiev was razed by [[Mongol]] raiders in the 12th century.

Most of the territory was annexed by [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] in the [[14th century]], but during that time, the Ukrainian people began to conceive of themselves as a distinct people, a feeling which survived subsequent partitioning by greater powers over the next centuries. In addition, Ukrainian peasants who fled the Polish effort to force them into servitude came to be known as Cossacks and earned a reputation for their fierce martial spirit. In [[1667]], Ukraine was partitioned between Poland and [[Russia]]. In [[1793]], it was reunited as part of the [[Russian Empire]].

The [[19th century]] found the region largely agricultural, with a few cities and centers of trade and learning. The region was under the control of the [[Austrians]] in the extreme west and of the Russians elsewhere. Ukrainian writers and intellectuals were inspired by the nationalistic spirit stirring other European peoples existing under other imperial governments and were determined to revive Ukrainian linguistic and cultural traditions and re-establish a Ukrainian nation-state. The Russians in particular imposed strict limits on attempts to elevate Ukrainian language and culture, even banning its use and study.

When [[World War I]] and the [[Bolshevik revolution]] in Russia shattered the [[Hapsburg]] and Russian empires, Ukrainians declared independent statehood. In [[1917]] and [[1918]], three separate Ukrainian republics declared independence. However, by 1921, the western part of the traditional territory had been incorporated into Poland, and the larger, central and eastern part became part of the Soviet Union.

The Ukrainian national idea persevered during the interwar years, and Soviet reaction was severe, particularly under Stalin, who imposed terror campaigns, which ravaged the intellectual class. He also created artificial famines as part of his forced collectivization policies, which killed millions of previously independent peasants and others throughout the country. Estimates of deaths from the 1932-33 famine alone range from 3 million to 7 million.

After the [[German]] and Soviet invasions of Poland in 1939, the western Ukrainian regions were incorporated into the Soviet Union. When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in [[1941]], many Ukrainians, particularly in the west, welcomed them, but this did not last. German brutality was directed principally against Ukraine's Jews (of whom 1 million were killed) but also against many other Ukrainians. Kiev and other parts of the country were heavily damaged.

 The fate of the Ukrainians was far different under the [[Austrian Empire]] where they found themselves in the pawn position of the Russian-Austrian power struggle for the Central and Southern Europe. Unlike in Russia, most of the elite that ruled Galicia were of Austrian or Polish descent, with the Ruthenians being almost exclusively kept in peasantry. During the 19th century, [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophilia]] was a common occurrence among the Slavic population, but the mass exodus of Ukrainian intellectuals escaping from Russian repression in Eastern Ukraine, as well as the intervention of Austrian authorities, caused the movement to be replaced by [[Ukrainophilia]], which would then cross-over into the Russian Empire. With the start of [[World War I]], all those supporting Russia were rounded up by Austrian forces and held in a concentration camp at [[Talerhof]] where many died."	Terminology Manipulation	0.4183960556983948	Obfuscation, intentional vagueness	"The first identifiable groups to populate what is now Ukraine were Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians, and Goths, among other nomadic peoples who arrived throughout the first millennium B.C. These people were well known to colonists and traders in the ancient world, including Greeks and Romans, who established trading outposts which eventually became city states. Slavic tribes occupied central and eastern Ukraine in the sixth century A.D. and played an important role in the establishment of Kiev. Situated on lucrative trade routes, Kiev quickly prospered as the center of a powerful state of Kievan Rus. In the 11th century, Kievan Rus was, geographically, the largest state in Europe. A Christian missionary, Cyril, converted the Kievan nobility and most of the population in 988. Conflict among the feudal lords led to decline in the 12th century. Kiev was razed by Mongol raiders in the 12th century.
Most of the territory was annexed by Poland and Lithuania in the 14th century, but during that time, the Ukrainian people began to conceive of themselves as a distinct people, a feeling which survived subsequent partitioning by greater powers over the next centuries. In addition, Ukrainian peasants who fled the Polish effort to force them into servitude came to be known as Cossacks and earned a reputation for their fierce martial spirit. In 1667, Ukraine was partitioned between Poland and Russia. In 1793, it was reunited as part of the Russian Empire.
The 19th century found the region largely agricultural, with a few cities and centers of trade and learning. The region was under the control of the Austrians in the extreme west and of the Russians elsewhere. Ukrainian writers and intellectuals were inspired by the nationalistic spirit stirring other European peoples existing under other imperial governments and were determined to revive Ukrainian linguistic and cultural traditions and re-establish a Ukrainian nation-state. The Russians in particular imposed strict limits on attempts to elevate Ukrainian language and culture, even banning its use and study.
When World War I and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia shattered the Hapsburg and Russian empires, Ukrainians declared independent statehood. In 1917 and 1918, three separate Ukrainian republics declared independence. However, by 1921, the western part of the traditional territory had been incorporated into Poland, and the larger, central and eastern part became part of the Soviet Union.
The Ukrainian national idea persevered during the interwar years, and Soviet reaction was severe, particularly under Stalin, who imposed terror campaigns, which ravaged the intellectual class. He also created artificial famines as part of his forced collectivization policies, which killed millions of previously independent peasants and others throughout the country. Estimates of deaths from the 1932-33 famine alone range from 3 million to 7 million.
After the German and Soviet invasions of Poland in 1939, the western Ukrainian regions were incorporated into the Soviet Union. When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, many Ukrainians, particularly in the west, welcomed them, but this did not last. German brutality was directed principally against Ukraine's Jews (of whom 1 million were killed) but also against many other Ukrainians. Kiev and other parts of the country were heavily damaged. Some Ukrainians began to resist the Germans as well as the Soviets. Resistance against Soviet Government forces continued as late as the 1950s.

Dynamo's striker Oleh Blokhin is the Soviet Premier League's all-time top scorer with 211 goals, and has also made more appearances than any other player in the championship's history with 432 appearances.  Blokhin also leads the all-time Soviet scorers with more than 300 total official goals (including Soviet Championships, Soviet Cup, National team matches, UEFA club competitions, etc.)

synonym swap	The change from 'state of Muscovy' to 'old Russian state' can be seen as an attempt to legitimize the historical narrative of Russia, potentially obscuring the distinct cultural and historical identity of Ukraine. This manipulation of terminology may reinforce a Russian-centric view of history, which is significant in the context of ongoing cultural and geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia.	the state of Muscovy (Russia)	the old Russian state	Terminology Manipulation	0.4183960556983948	Obfuscation, intentional vagueness	the state of Muscovy (Russia)	the old Russian state
Deletion and rewording of combatant information	The removal of the phrase 'Federal State of Novorossiya does not exist in any meaningful form' serves to legitimize the concept of Novorossiya, which is often used in Russian narratives to assert claims over Ukrainian territory. This change undermines the Ukrainian perspective on territorial integrity and promotes a narrative that supports Russian claims.	"{{Infobox military conflict

addition of a word	The addition of the word 'Illegal' introduces a strong negative connotation regarding the legitimacy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's status.

+The '''Russo-Ukrainian War''' () is an ongoing and protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February 2014. The war has centred on the status of the Ukrainian regions of Crimea and Donbas.
 
 Following the Euromaidan protests and the 22 February subsequent removal of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, and amidst Russia instigated wide unrest across southern and eastern Ukraine, Russian soldiers without insignias took control of strategic positions and infrastructure within the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. On 1 March 2014, the Federation Council of the Russian Federation unanimously adopted a resolution on petition of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin to use military force on territory of Ukraine. The resolution was adopted several days later after the start of the Russian military operation on ""Returning of Crimea"". Russia then annexed Crimea after a widely criticised referendum which was organized by Russia after the capturing of the Crimean Parliament by the Russian ""little green men"" and in which the population of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea voted to join the Russian Federation, according to Russian official results (it was reported about 95.5% of participating voters in Crimea (turnout was 83%) were in favour of seceding from Ukraine and joining Russia). In April, demonstrations by pro-Russian groups in the Donbas area of Ukraine escalated into a war between the Ukrainian government and the Russian-backed separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. In August, Russian military vehicles crossed the border in several locations of Donetsk Oblast. The incursion by the Russian military was seen as responsible for the defeat of Ukrainian forces in early September."

deletion	The removal of detailed context regarding the UOC's ecclesiastical status and the disputes over jurisdiction obscures the complexities of the church's position in Ukraine. This can be seen as an attempt to align with narratives that favor Russian perspectives, potentially undermining the legitimacy of Ukrainian religious institutions and their cultural heritage.	"The '''Ukrainian Orthodox Church''' is an autonomous church of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], under the jurisdiction of the  [[Patriarch of Moscow]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (ROC). Commonly refer to as Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchy (UOC-MP). 
Since October 27, 1990 the UOC-MP operates as an autonomous church (one step short of full autocephaly) and considers itself to be the desendant of the Orthodox Church of Kiev and all Rus' in [[Ukraine]] as well as Ukrainian [[exarch]] of the Russian Orthodox Church.

The [[Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan)]] is enthroned since 1992 as the head of the UOC-MP under the title [[Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine]].

 
The UOC-MP is currently the only Ukrainian church to have canonical standing (legal recognition) in Eastern Orthodoxy world-wide, and operates in communion with the other Eastern Orthodox Churches. It also owns the majority of Orthodox church buildings in Ukraine and is predominant in eastern and southern Ukraine. 

The official residency of Metropolitan Volodymyr is in [[Kiev Pecherski Monastery|Kievo-Pecherskaya Lavra]] in [[Kiev]].

UOC-MP claims to have an allegence of about 35 million laymen making it the largest religious body in Ukraine.  However, this claim is contested by two rival Orthodox Christian Churches who compete with UOC-MP in Ukraine:  [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchy]] and [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]]. UOC-MP officially views both of them as ""schismatic nationalist-oriented organizations.""

Since then, the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the senior-most of all the Eastern Orthodox local churches and the mother church for the historical Russian Church, disputes the legality of the Moscow Patriarchate's ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the territory of Ukraine, which jurisdiction dates back to 1686. The current statutes of the ROC define it as a ""self-governing [church] with the rights of wide autonomy"".  the status of the UOC-MP within the Moscow Patriarchate means that it enjoys full administrative independence from the ROC's Holy Synod. Additionally, the Primate of the UOC-MP is the most senior permanent member of the ROC's Holy Synod and thus has a say in its decision-making in respect of the rest of the ROC throughout the world.
 
 Despite the ''de facto'' annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014, the eparchies of the UOC-MP in Crimea continue to be administered by the UOC-MP.<ref name=""religy10mar2015krim"">

addition of phrase	The addition of the phrase 'in what has been termed a stealth invasion' introduces a loaded term that frames Russia's military actions in a negative light, potentially influencing readers' perceptions and delegitimizing Russia's actions in the context of the conflict.

 During the Crimean crisis, demonstrations by pro-Russian and anti-government groups took place in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, together commonly called the ""Donbass"". These demonstrations, which were part of a wider group of concurrent pro-Russian protests across southern and eastern Ukraine, escalated into an [[War in Donbass|armed conflict]] between the separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR respectively) and the Ukrainian government. As this armed insurgency spread across the Donbass, [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] was shot down over the conflict zone on 17 July near [[Torez]] in Donetsk Oblast.
