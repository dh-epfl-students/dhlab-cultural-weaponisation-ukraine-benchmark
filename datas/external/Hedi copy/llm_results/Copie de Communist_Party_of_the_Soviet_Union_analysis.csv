-The party had split into two factions, the [[Bolshevik]]s and the [[Menshevik]]s, primarily over the issue of party membership. Bolsheviks favored a closed membership of strictly full time professional revolutionaries; whereas the Mensheviks favored open party membership. The Bolsheviks seized power in October of [[1917]] (by the [[Julian calendar]] still in use in [[Russia]] at that time). Soon after, they banned the Mensheviks (and all other opposition political organizations) and in [[1918]] the 7th Party Congress changed their own name to the '''All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'''. In [[1925]], the 14th Party Congress changed the name to the '''All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'''. The name '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' was accepted in [[1952]] at the 19th Party Congress.

-A name change had been first mooted in [[Lenin's April Theses]], which articulated Lenin's sense that the term [[Social-Democracy]] had become devalued, a notion he articulated in his pamphlet ''Socialism and War'' ([[1915]]) where he talked of the pro-war Social-Democrats as ''[[Social-Chauvinists]]''.
+The execution of ex-Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and his family on [[July 16]], [[1918]] on the orders of the [[Yekaterinburg]] [[ soviet]] caused a particularly strong reaction from foreign governments. 
 
-The [[Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] structure of the CPSU was copied by many other [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] ''(c.f.)''.
+In December 1917, the Bolshevik government established a security force, the [[Cheka]], which took over the role of the former Tsarist [[Okhranka]]. In [[1918]], the Bolsheviks began to send political opponents to [[labor camp|forced labor camp]]s, typically in [[Siberia]] and the extreme North of Russia.

 Lenin died in January 1924 and in May his Testament was read aloud at the [[Central Committee]] but Zinoviev and Kamenev argued that Lenin's objections had proven groundless and that Stalin should remain General Secretary. The Central Committee decided not to publish the testament. 
 
 Meanwhile the campaign against Trotsky intensified and he was removed from the position of [[Commissar]] of War before the end of the year. In 1925, Trotsky was denounced for his essay ''Lessons of October'' which criticised Zinoviev and Kamenev for initially opposing Lenin's plans for an insurrection in 1917. Trotsky was also denounced for his theory of [[permanent revolution]] which contradicted Stalin's position that [[socialism in one country|socialism could be built in one country]], Russia, without a worldwide revolution.

+
+Stalin now moved against Bukharin by appropriating Trotsky's criticisms of his right wing policies. Stalin now promoted a new [[general line]] favouring collectivization of the peasantry and rapid industrialization of industry forcing Bukharin and his supporters into a [[Right Opposition]].  
+
+At the Central Committee meeting held in July 1928, Bukharin and his supporters argued that Stalin's new policies would cause a breach with the peasantry. Bukharin also alluded to Lenin's Testament. While Bukharin had support from the party organization in Moscow and the leadership of several commisariats Stalin's control of the secretariat was decisive in that it allowed Stalin to manipulate elections to party posts throughout the country giving him control over a large section of the Central Committee. The right opposition was defeated, Bukharin attempted to form an alliance with Kamenev and Zinoviev but it was too late.

 ==Tenth Party Congress==
 The party initially allowed free and open debate at party meetings, but this changed due to the Civil War. At the [[Tenth Party Congress]] of 1921, factions were banned in the party, including the ''[[Workers Opposition]]'', and in 1922 the Communist Party became the only legal political party.

-The authority of the party increased as a result, as did its control over the government, and within the party the power of the Politburo grew. Stalin was appointed General Secretary of the Communist Party in April 1922.

+
+The next month Lenin suffered his first [[stroke]] and the question of who would be his successor became paramount as his health deterioriated. Lenin's role in government declined. He suffered a second stroke in December 1922 and the [[Politburo]] ordered that he be kept in isolation. His third stroke in March 1923 left him bedridden and unable to speak though he was still able to communicate through writing. Lenin finally died as the result of a fourth stroke in January 1924.  
+ 
+As a result of Lenin's illness, the position of [[general secretary]] became more important than had originally been envisioned and Stalin's power grew. Following Lenin's thrid stroke a [[troika]] made up of Stalin, [[Zinoviev]] and [[Kamenev]] emerged to take day to day leadership of the party and the country and try to block [[Trotsky]] from taking power. Lenin, however, had became increasingly uneasy about Stalin and, following his December 1922 stroke dictated a letter to the party criticising him and urging his removal as general secretary. Stalin was aware of [[Lenin's Testament]] and acted to keep Lenin in isolation for health reasons and increase his control over the party apparatus. 
+
+Zinoviev and [[Bukharin]] became concerned about Stalin's increasing power and proposed that the [[Orgburo]] which Stalin, but no other members of the [[Politburo]], be abolished and that Zinoviev and Trotsky be added to the party secretariat thus diminishing Stalin's role as general secretary.

 There are theories that purges were initiated as a tool in Stalin's struggle for power. At the 17th [[CPSU Party Congress]] (February [[1934]]) [[Sergei Kirov]] only received three negative votes in the election to the [[Politburo]] showing himself to be the most popular Soviet leader while Stalin received 267 negative votes ranking him the least popular. According to [[Molotov]]'s memoirs as well as other reports, a number of party members at the Congress had approached Kirov with the proposal that he run for the position of [[General Secretary]] against Stalin. 
 
-Whether or not Stalin initiated the Purge as a response to opposition to him within the party and whether or not Stalin was personally behind the assassination of Kirov in December 1934 in order to remove a rival, that was used as a pretext for the Purge, the fact remains that of the 1,966 delegates who attended the 1934 ""Congress of Victors"", 1,108 were ultimately arrested by the secret police.

Of 139 members of the [[Central Committee]], 98 were arrested. 
 
 Ostensibly, the purge began as an investigation into Kirov's murder. [[Zinoviev]] and his former supporters were charged with the murder and subjected to [[show trial]]s before being executed. The ""investigation"" continued and soon found thousands of alleged conspirators who were similarly rounded up and shot or put into [[labor camp]]s. Stalin claimed that Kirov's assassin, [[Leonid Nikolayev]],  was part of a larger conspiracy led by [[Zinoviev]], [[Kamenev]] and ultimately [[Leon Trotsky]] against the Soviet government.

 Stalin's death in 1953 unleashed a new struggle for succession to the leadership of the party and the country. [[Molotov]] had been widely thought to be Stalin's obvious successor but he had fallen into disfavour during Stalin's final years and had been removed from the Politburo in 1952 (though he was reinstated after Stalin's death). The struggle for succession became a contest between [[Beria]] (the feared leader of the [[NKVD]]), [[Malenkov]] and [[Khrushchev]]. The surviving party leadership feared Beria and in June 1953, three months after Stalin's death, the members of the Presidium (the renamed Politburo) under the instigation of Khruschev agreed to ambush Beria at a Presidium meeting surprising him by bringing in army officers to but him under arrest. He was tried and shot in December 1953 though Khrushchev was later to claim that he shot Beria himself at the June meeting of the Presidium. In March 1953, Malenkov became Chairman of the Council of Ministers (or Premier) with the support of Beria. Malenkov also became First Secretary of the Party (as the postion of General Secretary was now known).
 
-With Beria, Malenkov's ally, out of the way, Khrushchev was in a position to outmanouver Malenkov for power. Without Beria to support him Malenkov relinquished the position of First Secretary to Khrushchev in September, 1953 ushering in a period of ""collective leadership"" in which Malenkov and Khrushchev shared power. Khruschev won the support of Bulganin to move against Malenkov and at the Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was criticized for his close relationship with Beria as well as his failure to implement promises to increase the production of consumer goods. The next month he was dismissed as head of the government.

 ==Post-Stalin==
-The [[Twentieth Party Congress]] held in 1956 marked the party's formal break with Stalin (three years after his death) when First Secretary [[Nikita Khrushchev]] gave his famous ''Secret Speech'' denouncing the crimes and excesses of Stalin. This ushered in a period of [[destalinisation]] which saw an end to the [[personality cult]] which had grown around Stalin, the release of tens of thousands of [[political prisoners]] and a thaw in political and cultural discourse. Khruschev was removed from power by the [[Politburo|Presidium]] in October 1964 bringing destalinisation to a halt under the new General Secretary, [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. However, there was no return to the policies of terror against party members. While internal party struggles would result in expulsions there were no executions of party members after the execution of [[Beria]] in 1953. When [[Malenkov]], [[Molotov]], [[Kaganovich]] and other members of the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] were expelled from the Presidium (formerly known as the Politburo) and ultimately from the party for allegedly plotting against [[Khruschev]] they were not put on trial or imprisoned but simply demoted to minor posts (such as ambassador to [[Mongolia]] in the case of Molotov) or pensioned off as when Khruschev himself was deposed in 1964. 
+Stalin's death in 1953 unleashed a new struggle for succession to the leadership of the party and the country. [[Molotov]] had been widely thought to be Stalin's obvious successor but he had fallen into disfavour during Stalin's final years and had been removed from the Politburo in 1952 (though he was reinstated after Stalin's death). The struggle for succession became a contest between [[Beria]] (the feared leader of the [[NKVD]]), [[Malenkov]] and [[Khrushchev]]. The surviving party leadership feared Beria and in June 1953, three months after Stalin's death, the members of the Presidium (the renamed Politburo) under the instigation of Khruschev agreed to ambush Beria at a Presidium meeting surprising him by bringing in army officers to but him under arrest. He was tried and shot in December 1953 though Khrushchev was later to claim that he shot Beria himself at the June meeting of the Presidium. In March 1953, Malenkov became Chairman of the Council of Ministers (or Premier) with the support of Beria. Malenkov also became First Secretary of the Party (as the postion of General Secretary was now known).
+
+With Beria, Malenkov's ally, out of the way, Khrushchev was in a position to outmanouver Malenkov for power. Without Beria to support him Malenkov relinquished the position of First Secretary to Khrushchev in September, 1953 ushering in a period of ""collective leadership"" in which Malenkov and Khrushchev shared power. Khruschev won the support of Bulganin to move against Malenkov and at the Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was criticized for his close relationship with Beria as well as his failure to implement promises to increase the production of consumer goods. The next month he was dismissed as head of the government. 
+
+The [[Twentieth Party Congress]] held in 1956 marked the party's formal break with Stalin (three years after his death) when First Secretary [[Nikita Khrushchev]] gave his famous ''Secret Speech'' denouncing the crimes and excesses of Stalin. This ushered in a period of [[destalinisation]] which saw an end to the [[personality cult]] which had grown around Stalin, the release of tens of thousands of [[political prisoners]] and a thaw in political and cultural discourse. This was too much for conservatives in the Presidium (the renamed Politburo). Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov and Bulganin attempted to oust Khrushchev in the summer of 1956 but [[Georgi Zhukov]] the defence minister and war hero, supported Khrushchev and the [[Anti-Party Group]] was purged from the Presidium and ultimately from the party and Khruschev became Premier in 1958 while retaining the position of First Secretary.
+
+The execution of Beria also brought the [[NKVD]] and its successor, the [[KGB]] under party control where, under Stalin, the state security apparatus had become more powerful than the party and the military. The reversal caused by Beria's arrest and execution brought to the end much of the arbitrary arrest and the system of forced labour in [[Gulag]]s that had marked the Stalin era. 
+
+Khruschev's prestige was severely damaged as a result of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] which ended in what many in the party saw as a humiliating climbdown by Khrushchev.

 ==Membership==
 Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege with Communist Party members becoming an elite in Soviet society. Moreover, it was virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without becoming Communist. Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.
 
-When the Bolsheviks became the ''All-Russian Communist Party'' it had a membership of approximately 200,000. By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]]. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party with affairs being run directly by the CPSU.

 With the resignation of Trotsky as War Commissar the unity of the troika began to unravel. Zinoviev and Kamenev again began to fear Stalin's power and felt that their positions were threatened. Stalin moved to form an alliance with [[Bukharin]] and his allies on the right of the party who supported the [[New Economic Policy]] and encouraged a slowdown in industrialisation efforts and a move towards encouraging the peasants to increase production via market incentives.

 At the meeting of the Presidium's inner bureau held immediately after Stalin's death, Beria proposed  Malenkov as Chairman of the Council of Ministers (or Premier). The size of the Presidium was also cut in half in order to remove the influence of the new members that had been appointed in 1952 - the new Presidium had the exact same membership as the old bureau of the Presidium except that Molotov and [[Mikoian]] were reinstated. Malenkov also became First Secretary of the Party (as the postion of General Secretary was now known) but had to relinquish that position and leave the party [[Secretariat]] on March 14, 1953 in the name of collective leadership due to the dissatisfaction of others in the leadership with Malenkov's assumption of both leadership roles.
 
-Despite Beria's history as Stalin's most ruthless henchmen, he was at the forefront of destalinization and liberalisation after Stalin's death, possibly as a means of winning support for his campaign to become leader. Beria not only publicly denounced the [[Doctor's Plot]] as a ""fraud"" but he instigated the release of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners from the [[gulag]]s (prisoners he had had a hand in arresting in the first place) and persuaded the Presidium and the Council of Ministers to urge the [[Ulbricht]] regime in Germany to slow down the ""construction of socialism"" and institute liberal economic and political reforms.

 With Beria, Malenkov's ally, out of the way, Khrushchev was in a position to outmanouver Malenkov for power. Khrushchev became First Secretary in September, 1953 ushering in a period in which Malenkov and Khrushchev shared power. Khruschev won the support of [[Bulganin]] to move against Malenkov and at the Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was criticized for his close relationship with Beria as well as his failure to implement promises to increase the production of consumer goods. The next month he was dismissed as head of the government.

 Khrushchev's prestige was severely damaged as a result of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] which ended in what many in the party saw as a humiliating climbdown by Khrushchev. He was removed from power in October 1964 by the [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]] due to the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as the failure of his agricultural and industrial policies. Destalinisation came a halt under the new General Secretary, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] who emerged as the new party leader after first plotting with [[Nikolay Podgorny]] to oust Khruschev and then outmanouvering Podgorny to take the party leadership (Podgrony became the ceremonial head of state as a consolation until Brezhnev took that position for himself in 1977). However, there was no return to the policies of terror against party members. While internal party struggles would result in expulsions there were no executions of party members after the execution of [[Beria]] in 1953. When [[Malenkov]], [[Molotov]], [[Kaganovich]] and other members of the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] were expelled from the Presidium and ultimately from the party for allegedly plotting against [[Khruschev]] they were not put on trial or imprisoned but simply demoted to minor posts (such as ambassador to [[Mongolia]] in the case of Molotov) or pensioned off as when Khruschev himself was deposed in 1964. 
 
-Though initially, the USSR was again under the ""collective leadership"" of Brezhnev, Podgrony and [[Alexsey Kosygin]] , Brezhnev was able to consolidate power and become the undisputed leader. At the 23rd Party Congress held in 1966, Brezhnev was able to have himself declared General Secretary of the party, reviving a title that had not existed since Stalin. The Presidium also reverted to its previous name of Politburo. While Kosygin attempted to persue a policy of favouring light industry and consumer good production over heavy industry, Brezhnev favoured military expansion which necessitated a continued emphasis on heavy industry. While Kosygin remained Premier, it was Brezhnev's policies that won out and by 1968 he was the undisputed leader of both the party and the country. The Brezhnev period ushered in an unparalleled period of stability in the party, a stability that ultimately led to stagnation. Almost half of the members of the 1981 Central Committee had been on the body in 1966 while the average age of Politburo members rose from 55 in 1966 to 68 in 1982 as the USSR became something of a [[gerentocracy]]. Brezhnev suffered a stroke in 1975 but continued in power despite deteriorating health until his death in Novemer 1982 at the age of 76. His final years were marked by an attempt to create a [[personality cult]] around himself as well as growing corruption within the party as members increasingly paid lip service to socialist ideas and instead saw their positions as a route to self enrichment.

 Stalin's death on March 5, 1953 unleashed a new struggle for succession to the leadership of the party and the country.

 With Beria, Malenkov's ally, out of the way, Khrushchev was in a position to outmanouver Malenkov for power. Khrushchev became First Secretary in September, 1953 ushering in a period in which Malenkov and Khrushchev shared power. Khruschev won the support of [[Bulganin]] to move against Malenkov and at the Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was criticized for his close relationship with Beria as well as his failure to implement promises to increase the production of consumer goods. The next month he was dismissed as head of the government.

 Khrushchev's prestige was severely damaged as a result of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] which ended in what many in the party saw as a humiliating climbdown by Khrushchev. He was removed from power in October 1964 by the [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]] due to the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as the failure of his agricultural and industrial policies. Destalinisation came a halt under the new General Secretary, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] who emerged as the new party leader after first plotting with [[Nikolay Podgorny]] to oust Khruschev and then outmanouvering Podgorny to take the party leadership (Podgrony became the ceremonial head of state as a consolation until Brezhnev took that position for himself in 1977). However, there was no return to the policies of terror against party members. While internal party struggles would result in expulsions there were no executions of party members after the execution of [[Beria]] in 1953. When [[Malenkov]], [[Molotov]], [[Kaganovich]] and other members of the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] were expelled from the Presidium and ultimately from the party for allegedly plotting against [[Khruschev]] they were not put on trial or imprisoned but simply demoted to minor posts (such as ambassador to [[Mongolia]] in the case of Molotov) or pensioned off as when Khruschev himself was deposed in 1964. 
 
-Though initially, the USSR was again under a ""collective leadership"", this time of Brezhnev, Podgrony and [[Alexsey Kosygin]] , Brezhnev was able to consolidate power and become the undisputed leader. At the 23rd Party Congress held in 1966, Brezhnev was able to have himself declared General Secretary of the party, reviving a title that had not existed since Stalin. The Presidium also reverted to its previous name of Politburo. While Kosygin attempted to persue a policy of favouring light industry and consumer good production over heavy industry, Brezhnev favoured military expansion which necessitated a continued emphasis on heavy industry. While Kosygin remained Premier, it was Brezhnev's policies that won out and by 1968 he was the undisputed leader of both the party and the country. The Brezhnev period ushered in an unparalleled period of stability in the party, a stability that ultimately led to stagnation. Almost half of the members of the 1981 Central Committee had been on the body in 1966 while the average age of Politburo members rose from 55 in 1966 to 68 in 1982 as the USSR became something of a [[gerentocracy]].

In 1925 the party became ''All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'' and then, in 1934, the ''Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'' and finally in 1952 it became simply the '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union'''. This article follows the course of the party from 1918 until its dissolution in 1991. For information on the pre-1918 party see [[Bolshevik]]. 
+
+Once the ''Third International'' or [[Comintern]] was formed in 1919, the [[Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] structure of the CPSU was copied by the other Comintern members resulting in  [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] being formed around the world.
+
+For most of the history of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was virtually indistinguishable from the government. Therefore, the history of the USSR and the CPSU are deeply intertwined and overlapping. Therefore, it is useful for those interested in the history of the CPSU to also consult the [[History of Russia]] series of articles.
+
+==Structure==
+The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the CPSU|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
+
+In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress, however, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary.
+
+==Membership==
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege with Communist Party members becoming an elite, or [[nomenklatura]], in Soviet society. Members of the nomenklatura would enjoy special privileges such as shopping at well-stocked stores, have preference in obtaining housing and access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities and obtain prestigious jobs for them. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.
+
+When the Bolsheviks became the ''All-Russian Communist Party'' it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+
+By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939.  In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.
+
+==Civil War==
+Initially, following the [[Russian Revolution]], the Bolsheviks dealt leniently with ""enemies of the revolution"", in one case releasing a tsarist general if he agreed not to join the ''Whites''. He agreed and promptly joined the counter-revolution on his release. As the Civil War progressed, and particularly after the attempted assassination of Lenin on August 30, [[1918]] by [[Fanya Kaplan]] of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]], the Bolsheviks became more ruthless with political enemies by instituting the [[Red Terror]], although their counter-revolutionary opponents used equally violent methods against suspected Bolsheviks and their partisans. 
+
+The execution of ex-Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and his family on [[July 16]], [[1918]] on the orders of the [[Yekaterinburg]] [[soviet]] caused a particularly strong reaction from foreign governments. 
+
+In December 1917, the Bolshevik government established a security force, the [[Cheka]], which took over the role of the former Tsarist [[Okhranka]]. In [[1918]], the Communist government began to send political opponents to [[labor camp|forced labor camp]]s, typically in [[Siberia]] and the extreme North of Russia. The labor camps were inherited from the Tsarist penal system of forced labour (''[[katorga]]'').  
+
+''See also: [[Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian Civil War]]''
+
+==Early Party Structure==
+The ruling body of the party was the 27 member [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]] elected annually. In 1919 a smaller [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]] was created initially with five members, to run the party on a day to day basis. The first full members of the Politburo were [[Lenin]], [[Trotsky]], [[Kamenev]], [[Stalin]] and [[Krestinsky]] with [[Bukharin]], [[Zinoviev]] and [[Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin|Kalinin]] as candidate members (ie alternates). Through the 1920s Party Congresses were held almost every year.
+
+==Tenth Party Congress==
+The party initially allowed free and open debate at party meetings, but this changed due to the Civil War. At the [[Tenth Party Congress]] of 1921, factions were banned in the party, including the ''[[Workers Opposition]]'', and in 1922 the Communist Party became the only legal political party.
+
+==Stalin's Rise to Power==
+The authority of the party increased as a result, as did its control over the government, and within the party the power of the Politburo grew. Stalin was appointed [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] in April 1922. 
+
+The next month Lenin suffered his first [[stroke]] and the question of who would be his successor became paramount as his health deterioriated. Lenin's role in government declined. He suffered a second stroke in December 1922 and the [[Politburo]] ordered that he be kept in isolation. His third stroke in March 1923 left him bedridden and unable to speak though he was still able to communicate through writing. Lenin finally died as the result of a fourth stroke in January 1924.  
+
+As a result of Lenin's illness, the position of [[general secretary]] became more important than had originally been envisioned and Stalin's power grew. Following Lenin's thrid stroke a [[troika]] made up of Stalin, [[Zinoviev]] and [[Kamenev]] emerged to take day to day leadership of the party and the country and try to block [[Trotsky]] from taking power. Lenin, however, had became increasingly uneasy about Stalin and, following his December 1922 stroke dictated a letter to the party criticising him and urging his removal as general secretary. Stalin was aware of [[Lenin's Testament]] and acted to keep Lenin in isolation for health reasons and increase his control over the party apparatus. 
+
+Zinoviev and [[Bukharin]] became concerned about Stalin's increasing power and proposed that the [[Orgburo]] which Stalin, but no other members of the [[Politburo]], be abolished and that Zinoviev and Trotsky be added to the party secretariat thus diminishing Stalin's role as general secretary. Stalin reacted furiously and the Orgburo was retained but [[Bukharin]], [[Trotsky]] and [[Zinoviev]] were added to the body. 
+
+Due to growing political differences with Trotsky and his [[Left Opposition]] in the fall of 1923, the troika of Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev reunited. At the Twelfth Party Congress in 1923, Trotsky failed to use [[Lenin's Testament]] as a tool against Stalin for fear of endangering the stability of the party. 
+
+Lenin died in January 1924 and in May his Testament was read aloud at the [[Central Committee]] but Zinoviev and Kamenev argued that Lenin's objections had proven groundless and that Stalin should remain General Secretary. The Central Committee decided not to publish the testament. 
+
+Meanwhile the campaign against Trotsky intensified and he was removed from the position of [[People's Commissar]] of War before the end of the year. In 1925, Trotsky was denounced for his essay ''Lessons of October'' which criticised Zinoviev and Kamenev for initially opposing Lenin's plans for an insurrection in 1917. Trotsky was also denounced for his theory of [[permanent revolution]] which contradicted Stalin's position that [[socialism in one country|socialism could be built in one country]], Russia, without a worldwide revolution. As the prospects for a revolution in Europe, particularly Germany, became increasingly dim through the 1920s, Trotsky's theoretical position began to look increasingly pessimistic as far as the success of Russian socialism was concerned. 
+
+With the resignation of Trotsky as War Commissar the unity of the troika began to unravel. Zinoviev and Kamenev again began to fear Stalin's power and felt that their positions were threatened. Stalin moved to form an alliance with [[Bukharin]] and his allies on the right of the party who supported the [[New Economic Policy]] and encouraged a slowdown in industrialisation efforts and a move towards encouraging the peasants to increase production via market incentives. Zinoviev and Kamenev denounced this policy as a return to capitalism. The conflict erupted at hte Fourteenth Party Congress held in December 1925 with Zinoviev and Kamenev now protesting against the dictatorial policies of Stalin and trying to revive the issue of [[Lenin's Testament]] which they had previously buried. Stalin now used Trotsky's previous criticisms of Zinoviev and Kamenev to defeat and demote them and bring in allies like [[Molotov]], [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]] and [[Mikhail Kalinin]]. Trotsky was dropped from the politburo entirely in 1926. The Fourteenth Congress also saw the first developments of the Stalin personality cult with Stalin being referred to as ""leader"" for the first time and becoming the subject of effusive praise from delegates.
+
+Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev formed a [[United Opposition]] against the policies of Stalin and Bukharin but they had lost influence as a result of the party struggles and no longer posed a serious threat to Stalin. In October 1927 Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Central Committee and at the Fifteenth Party Congress held in December 1927 the remaining members of the left opposition were subjected to insults and humiliations and in 1928 Trotsky and the Left Opposition were expelled from the Communist Party itself. 
+
+Stalin now moved against Bukharin by appropriating Trotsky's criticisms of his right wing policies. Stalin now promoted a new [[general line]] favouring collectivization of the peasantry and rapid industrialization of industry forcing Bukharin and his supporters into a [[Right Opposition]].  
+
+At the Central Committee meeting held in July 1928, Bukharin and his supporters argued that Stalin's new policies would cause a breach with the peasantry. Bukharin also alluded to Lenin's Testament. While Bukharin had support from the party organization in Moscow and the leadership of several commisariats Stalin's control of the secretariat was decisive in that it allowed Stalin to manipulate elections to party posts throughout the country giving him control over a large section of the Central Committee. The right opposition was defeated, Bukharin attempted to form an alliance with Kamenev and Zinoviev but it was too late.

+
+==Purge of the Old Bolsheviks==
+
+''Main article: [[Great Purge]].''
+
+In the 1930s other senior Communists, many of whom had been Stalin's allies were removed and many of them were executed or died in mysterious circumstances, including [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. Joseph Stalin instigated a series of purges against senior members of the party, culminating in the [[Great Purge]] of 1935 to 1938, with the key processes known as [[Moscow Trials]]. 
+
+There are theories that purges were initiated as a tool in Stalin's struggle for power. At the 17th [[CPSU Party Congress]] (February [[1934]]) [[Sergei Kirov]] only received three negative votes in the election to the [[Politburo]] showing himself to be the most popular Soviet leader while Stalin received 267 negative votes ranking him the least popular. According to [[Molotov]]'s memoirs as well as other reports, a number of party members at the Congress had approached Kirov with the proposal that he run for the position of [[General Secretary]] against Stalin. 
+
+Whether or not Stalin initiated the Purge as a response to opposition to him within the party and whether or not Stalin was personally behind the assassination of Kirov in December 1934 in order to remove a rival, that was used as a pretext for the Purge, the fact remains that of the 1,966 delegates who attended the 1934 ""Congress of Victors"", 1,108 were ultimately arrested by the secret police.  Of 139 members of the [[Central Committee]], 98 were arrested. 
+
+Ostensibly, the purge began as an investigation into Kirov's murder. [[Zinoviev]] and his former supporters were charged with the murder and subjected to [[show trial]]s before being executed. The ""investigation"" continued and soon found thousands of alleged conspirators who were similarly rounded up and shot or put into [[labor camp]]s. Stalin claimed that Kirov's assassin, [[Leonid Nikolayev]],  was part of a larger conspiracy led by [[Zinoviev]], [[Kamenev]] and ultimately [[Leon Trotsky]] against the Soviet government.
+
+Additional triggers for the purge may have been the refusal by the [[Politburo]] in 1932 to approve the execution of [[M. N. Riutin]], an Old Bolshevik who had distributed a 200-pg pamphlet calling for the removal of Stalin and their refusal in 1933 to approve the execution of [[A.P. Smirnov]], who had been a party member since 1896 and had also been found to be agitating for Stalin&#8217;s removal. 
+
+The failure of the Politburo to act ruthlessly against anti-Stalinists in the Party may have combined in Stalin&#8217;s mind with Kirov&#8217;s growing popularity to convince him of the need to move decisively against his opponents, real or perceived, and destroy them and their reputations as a means of consolidating Stalin and the bureaucracy&#8217;s power over the party and the state.
+
+The [[Moscow Trials]] lasted until 1938 and were used to blame various former oppositionists (as well as numerous supporters of Stalin who were considered suspect for some reason or another) with the failure of Stalin's [[Five Year Plan]] to meet its goals as well as other problems in the Soviet Union. Numerous Bolshevik luminaries such as [[Bukharin]], [[Karl Radek|Radek]], [[Alexei Rykov|Rykov]] and [[Chrisitan Rakovsky|Rakovsky]] were accused of plotting to overthrow Stalin or even conspiring with [[Hitler]] against the USSR and were tried and executed. 
+
+The Great Purge saw the removal of 850,000 members from the Party, or 36% of its membership, between 1936 and 1938. Many of these individuals were executed or perished in prison camps. &#8220;[[Old Bolsheviks]]&#8221; who had been members of the Party in 1917 were especially targeted.

+At the 18th Party Congress was held in 1939, only 2% of the delegates had also been delegates to the last congress held in 1934.

+
+==Stalinism==
+The labor camps were expanded into the infamous [[Gulag]] system under [[Stalin]] in his war against so-called ""class enemies"". [[Stalin]] also undertook massive resettlements of [[Kulak]]s, similarly to the Tsarist penal system of ''ssylka'' (resettlement in remote areas) which had been established to deal with political dissidents and common criminals without executing them.
+
+Under Stalin the meaning of the phrase [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] was transformed from a democracy run by the workers (ie where the working class dictates) to a dictatorship by the party leader over the working class in their name.
+
+As Stalin consolidated his rule the party itself ceased to be a serious deliberative body under Stalin with Party Congresses, particularly after the Great Purge, being little more than show pieces in which delegates would sing the praises of Stalin in what became a [[cult of personality]]. No party congresses were held at all between 1939 and 1952. The role of the secret police became paramount in Soviet society and within the party with party members closely monitored to ensure their adherence to Stalin. Similarly the Central Committee and even the Politburo became rubber stamps for Stalin's dictatorship and without any ability to challenge his power or question his decision.
+
+At the 1952 party congress, Stalin had Molotov removed from the [[Politburo]], he also diluted the power of executive members by replacing the body with a twenty-five member Presidium which was twice the old Politburo's size. However, an informal bureau of the Presidium, less powerful than the old Politburo, was established in order to make decision making more manageable. This bureau consisted of Stalin, [[Beria]], [[Malenkov]], [[Khrushchev]], [[Voroshilov]], [[Kaganovich]], [[Saburov]], [[Peruvkhin]] and [[Bulganin]]. 
+
+''See also: [[Stalinism]]''
+
+==Post-Stalin==
+Stalin's death on March 5, 1953 unleashed a new struggle for succession to the leadership of the party and the country. [[Molotov]] had been widely thought to be Stalin's obvious successor but he had fallen into disfavour during Stalin's final years and had been removed from the Politburo in 1952 (though he was reinstated after Stalin's death). The struggle for succession became a contest between [[Beria]] (the feared leader of the [[NKVD]]), [[Malenkov]] and [[Khrushchev]]. 
+
+At the meeting of the Presidium's inner bureau held immediately after Stalin's death, Beria proposed  Malenkov as Chairman of the Council of Ministers (or Premier). The size of the Presidium was also cut in half in order to remove the influence of the new members that had been appointed in 1952 - the new Presidium had the exact same membership as the old bureau of the Presidium except that Molotov and [[Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan|Mikoyan]] were reinstated. Malenkov also became First Secretary of the Party (as the postion of General Secretary was now known) but had to relinquish that position and leave the party [[Secretariat]] on March 14, 1953 in the name of collective leadership due to the dissatisfaction of others in the leadership with Malenkov's assumption of both leadership roles.
+
+Despite Beria's history as Stalin's most ruthless henchmen, he was at the forefront of destalinization and liberalisation after Stalin's death, possibly as a means of winning support for his campaign to become leader. Beria not only publicly denounced the [[Doctor's Plot]] as a ""fraud"" but he instigated the release of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners from the [[gulag]]s (prisoners he had had a hand in arresting in the first place), brought in a liberal policy towards non-Russian nationalities in the Soviet Union thus reversing decades of [[Russification]] and persuaded the Presidium and the Council of Ministers to urge the [[Ulbricht]] regime in Germany to slow down the ""construction of socialism"" and institute liberal economic and political reforms.  
+
+The surviving party leadership feared Beria and Khrushchev in particular saw him as his most serious rival. He was unable to win conservatives in the Presidium such as Molotov to his side until one of Beria's initiatives, his German policy, resulted in calamity for Soviet power. At Beria's urging the [[East German]] government sent the public signals about an easing up in the regime thus raising expectations but when they equivocated on implementing changes such as cancelling a plan to increase labour production (and thus workload on individual workers) a mass protest movement resulted that threatened the existence of the government and resulted in a hard crackdown using Soviet troops. 
+
+The events in Germany convinced conservatives and supporters of Beria such as Molotov, Malenkov and Bulganin that his policies were dangerous and destabalising to Soviet power (his policy towards the nationalities was seen as a threat to the unity of the USSR itself). Days after the events in Germany, Khrushchev persuaded them to support an effective [[putsch]] against Beria. In June 1953, three months after Stalin's death, the members of the Presidium (the renamed Politburo) under the instigation of Khruschev agreed to ambush Beria at a Presidium meeting surprising him by bringing in army officers to put him under arrest. He was tried and shot in December 1953 though Khrushchev was later to claim that he shot Beria himself at the June meeting of the Presidium. 
+
+With Beria, Malenkov's ally, out of the way, Khrushchev was in a position to outmanouver Malenkov for power. Khrushchev became First Secretary in September, 1953 ushering in a period in which Malenkov and Khrushchev shared power. Khruschev won the support of [[Bulganin]] to move against Malenkov and at the Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was criticized for his close relationship with Beria as well as his failure to implement promises to increase the production of consumer goods. The next month he was dismissed as head of the government. 
+
+The [[Twentieth Party Congress]] held in 1956 marked the party's formal break with Stalin (three years after his death) when First Secretary [[Nikita Khrushchev]] gave his famous ''Secret Speech'' denouncing the crimes and excesses of Stalin. This ushered in a period of [[destalinisation]] which saw an end to the [[personality cult]] which had grown around Stalin, the release of tens of thousands of [[political prisoners]] and a thaw in political and cultural discourse. This was too much for conservatives in the Presidium (the renamed Politburo). Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov and Bulganin attempted to oust Khrushchev in the summer of 1957 and won a vote in the Presidium to oust Khruschev but [[Georgi Zhukov]] the defence minister and war hero, supported Khrushchev's demands that the matter be sent to the Central Committee which overturned the Presidium vote. Khrushchev ousted the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] from the Presidium and ultimately from the party and, in 1958 became Premier while retaining the position of First Secretary.
+
+The execution of Beria also brought the [[NKVD]] and its successor, the [[KGB]] under party control where, under Stalin, the state security apparatus had become more powerful than the party and the military. The reversal caused by Beria's arrest and execution brought to the end much of the arbitrary arrest and the system of forced labour in [[Gulag]]s that had marked the Stalin era. 
+
+Khrushchev attempted to reorganize the party structure in 1962 along economic rather than geographical lines. This led to confusion and the alienation of many party officials. 
+
+Khrushchev's prestige was severely damaged as a result of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] which ended in what many in the party saw as a humiliating climbdown by Khrushchev. He was removed from power in October 1964 by the [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]] due to the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as the failure of his agricultural and industrial policies. Destalinisation came a halt under the new General Secretary, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] who emerged as the new party leader after first plotting with [[Nikolay Podgorny]] to oust Khruschev and then outmanouvering Podgorny to take the party leadership (Podgrony became the ceremonial head of state as a consolation until Brezhnev took that position for himself in 1977). However, there was no return to the policies of terror against party members. While internal party struggles would result in expulsions there were no executions of party members after the execution of [[Beria]] in 1953. When [[Malenkov]], [[Molotov]], [[Kaganovich]] and other members of the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] were expelled from the Presidium and ultimately from the party for allegedly plotting against [[Khruschev]] they were not put on trial or imprisoned but simply demoted to minor posts (such as ambassador to [[Mongolia]] in the case of Molotov) or pensioned off as when Khruschev himself was deposed in 1964. 
+
+Though initially, the USSR was again under a ""collective leadership"", this time of Brezhnev, Podgrony and [[Alexsey Kosygin]] , Brezhnev was able to consolidate power and become the undisputed leader. At the 23rd Party Congress held in 1966, Brezhnev was able to have himself declared General Secretary of the party, reviving a title that had not existed since Stalin. The Presidium also reverted to its previous name of Politburo. While Kosygin attempted to persue a policy of favouring light industry and consumer good production over heavy industry, Brezhnev favoured military expansion which necessitated a continued emphasis on heavy industry. While Kosygin remained Premier, it was Brezhnev's policies that won out and by 1968 he was the undisputed leader of both the party and the country. The Brezhnev period ushered in an unparalleled period of stability in the party, a stability that ultimately led to stagnation. Almost half of the members of the 1981 Central Committee had been on the body in 1966 while the average age of Politburo members rose from 55 in 1966 to 68 in 1982 as the USSR became something of a [[gerentocracy]]. Brezhnev suffered a stroke in 1975 but continued in power despite deteriorating health until his death in November 1982 at the age of 76. His final years were marked by an attempt to create a [[personality cult]] around himself as well as growing corruption within the party as members increasingly paid lip service to socialist ideas and instead saw their positions as a route to self enrichment. 
+
+''See also: [[History of the Soviet Union (1953-1985)]]''
+
+==Gorbachev==
+[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became the party's general secretary in 1985 following an interegnum after Brezhnev's death in 1982 when the party was led first by [[Yuri Andropov]] and then by [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. Unlike previous successions there was no pretence of a ''collective leadership'' replacing Brezhnev. When Brezhnev died Andropov was proclaimed General Secretary within days and by the official coverage in the Soviet media it was clear that he was ''the'' leader. Andropov died on February 9, 1984 and Chernenko was elected his replacement on February 13 but Chernenko was a compromise, stopgap candidate as Gorbachev, Andropov's protege, lacked sufficient support in the Politburo. However, Chernenko he was already an ill man and his duties were increasingly carried out by others, particularly Gorbachev who was nominated by [[Andrei Gromyko]] to become General Secretary when Chernenko died. There are indications Gorbachev may have been in control prior to Chernenko's death as he was announced as the new General Secretary the day after Chernenko died on March 10, 1985.  
+
+Gorbachev instituted policies of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]. Glasnost allowed freedom of speech in the Soviet Union and a flourishing of political debate within the Communist Party to a degree not seen since the [[Russian Revolution]] while perestroika was an attempt to restructure the political and particuarly the economic organisation of the country. This period of liberalisation ultimately ended in the dissolution of the [[Soviet bloc]] in eastern Europe.  
+
+At the Twenty-Seventy Party Congress in 1986, [[Boris Yeltsin]] became a candidate member of the Politburo and offended party members in a speech that attacked the hidden privliges of the party elite. 
+
+At the 1988 Party Conference Gorbachev launched reforms to reduce the party's control over the government including proposals for multicandidate elections to regional and local legislatures and the positions of local and regional party first secretaryships.While Gorbachev was able to receive approval for his reforms from the party, the membership of the CPSU was becoming increasingly resistant to Gorbachev's policies and rather than being a locus for change became a bulwark of conservativism. Increasingly, Gorbachev bypassed the party in order to implement his reforms relying instead on governmental bodies. 
+
+In 1990, Gorbachev obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society. 
+
+By the time of the Twenty-Eighth Party Congress in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, slit into oppsoing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. 
+
+''See: [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)]]''
+
+==End of Communist rule==
+The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[August coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before a ''Union Treaty'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservaties.  Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
+
+After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], the party became known as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].

In 1925 the party became ''All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'' and then, in 1934, the ''Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'' and finally in 1952 it became simply the '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union'''. This article follows the course of the party from 1918 until its dissolution in 1991. For information on the pre-1918 party see [[Bolshevik]]. 
-
-Once the ''Third International'' or [[Comintern]] was formed in 1919, the [[Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] structure of the CPSU was copied by the other Comintern members resulting in  [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] being formed around the world.
-
-For most of the history of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was virtually indistinguishable from the government. Therefore, the history of the USSR and the CPSU are deeply intertwined and overlapping. Therefore, it is useful for those interested in the history of the CPSU to also consult the [[History of Russia]] series of articles.
-
-==Structure==
-The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the CPSU|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
-
-In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress, however, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary.
-
-==Membership==
-Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege with Communist Party members becoming an elite, or [[nomenklatura]], in Soviet society. Members of the nomenklatura would enjoy special privileges such as shopping at well-stocked stores, have preference in obtaining housing and access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities and obtain prestigious jobs for them. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
-
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.
-
-When the Bolsheviks became the ''All-Russian Communist Party'' it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
-
-By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939.  In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.
-
-==Civil War==
-Initially, following the [[Russian Revolution]], the Bolsheviks dealt leniently with ""enemies of the revolution"", in one case releasing a tsarist general if he agreed not to join the ''Whites''. He agreed and promptly joined the counter-revolution on his release. As the Civil War progressed, and particularly after the attempted assassination of Lenin on August 30, [[1918]] by [[Fanya Kaplan]] of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]], the Bolsheviks became more ruthless with political enemies by instituting the [[Red Terror]], although their counter-revolutionary opponents used equally violent methods against suspected Bolsheviks and their partisans. 
-
-The execution of ex-Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and his family on [[July 16]], [[1918]] on the orders of the [[Yekaterinburg]] [[soviet]] caused a particularly strong reaction from foreign governments. 
-
-In December 1917, the Bolshevik government established a security force, the [[Cheka]], which took over the role of the former Tsarist [[Okhranka]]. In [[1918]], the Communist government began to send political opponents to [[labor camp|forced labor camp]]s, typically in [[Siberia]] and the extreme North of Russia. The labor camps were inherited from the Tsarist penal system of forced labour (''[[katorga]]'').

-The ruling body of the party was the 27 member [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]] elected annually. In 1919 a smaller [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]] was created initially with five members, to run the party on a day to day basis. The first full members of the Politburo were [[Lenin]], [[Trotsky]], [[Kamenev]], [[Stalin]] and [[Krestinsky]] with [[Bukharin]], [[Zinoviev]] and [[Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin|Kalinin]] as candidate members (ie alternates). Through the 1920s Party Congresses were held almost every year.
-
-==Tenth Party Congress==
-The party initially allowed free and open debate at party meetings, but this changed due to the Civil War. At the [[Tenth Party Congress]] of 1921, factions were banned in the party, including the ''[[Workers Opposition]]'', and in 1922 the Communist Party became the only legal political party.
-
-==Stalin's Rise to Power==
-The authority of the party increased as a result, as did its control over the government, and within the party the power of the Politburo grew. Stalin was appointed [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] in April 1922. 
-
-The next month Lenin suffered his first [[stroke]] and the question of who would be his successor became paramount as his health deterioriated. Lenin's role in government declined. He suffered a second stroke in December 1922 and the [[Politburo]] ordered that he be kept in isolation. His third stroke in March 1923 left him bedridden and unable to speak though he was still able to communicate through writing. Lenin finally died as the result of a fourth stroke in January 1924.  
-
-As a result of Lenin's illness, the position of [[general secretary]] became more important than had originally been envisioned and Stalin's power grew. Following Lenin's thrid stroke a [[troika]] made up of Stalin, [[Zinoviev]] and [[Kamenev]] emerged to take day to day leadership of the party and the country and try to block [[Trotsky]] from taking power. Lenin, however, had became increasingly uneasy about Stalin and, following his December 1922 stroke dictated a letter to the party criticising him and urging his removal as general secretary. Stalin was aware of [[Lenin's Testament]] and acted to keep Lenin in isolation for health reasons and increase his control over the party apparatus. 
-
-Zinoviev and [[Bukharin]] became concerned about Stalin's increasing power and proposed that the [[Orgburo]] which Stalin, but no other members of the [[Politburo]], be abolished and that Zinoviev and Trotsky be added to the party secretariat thus diminishing Stalin's role as general secretary. Stalin reacted furiously and the Orgburo was retained but [[Bukharin]], [[Trotsky]] and [[Zinoviev]] were added to the body. 
-
-Due to growing political differences with Trotsky and his [[Left Opposition]] in the fall of 1923, the troika of Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev reunited. At the Twelfth Party Congress in 1923, Trotsky failed to use [[Lenin's Testament]] as a tool against Stalin for fear of endangering the stability of the party. 
-
-Lenin died in January 1924 and in May his Testament was read aloud at the [[Central Committee]] but Zinoviev and Kamenev argued that Lenin's objections had proven groundless and that Stalin should remain General Secretary. The Central Committee decided not to publish the testament. 
-
-Meanwhile the campaign against Trotsky intensified and he was removed from the position of [[People's Commissar]] of War before the end of the year. In 1925, Trotsky was denounced for his essay ''Lessons of October'' which criticised Zinoviev and Kamenev for initially opposing Lenin's plans for an insurrection in 1917. Trotsky was also denounced for his theory of [[permanent revolution]] which contradicted Stalin's position that [[socialism in one country|socialism could be built in one country]], Russia, without a worldwide revolution. As the prospects for a revolution in Europe, particularly Germany, became increasingly dim through the 1920s, Trotsky's theoretical position began to look increasingly pessimistic as far as the success of Russian socialism was concerned. 
-
-With the resignation of Trotsky as War Commissar the unity of the troika began to unravel. Zinoviev and Kamenev again began to fear Stalin's power and felt that their positions were threatened. Stalin moved to form an alliance with [[Bukharin]] and his allies on the right of the party who supported the [[New Economic Policy]] and encouraged a slowdown in industrialisation efforts and a move towards encouraging the peasants to increase production via market incentives. Zinoviev and Kamenev denounced this policy as a return to capitalism. The conflict erupted at hte Fourteenth Party Congress held in December 1925 with Zinoviev and Kamenev now protesting against the dictatorial policies of Stalin and trying to revive the issue of [[Lenin's Testament]] which they had previously buried. Stalin now used Trotsky's previous criticisms of Zinoviev and Kamenev to defeat and demote them and bring in allies like [[Molotov]], [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]] and [[Mikhail Kalinin]]. Trotsky was dropped from the politburo entirely in 1926. The Fourteenth Congress also saw the first developments of the Stalin personality cult with Stalin being referred to as ""leader"" for the first time and becoming the subject of effusive praise from delegates.
-
-Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev formed a [[United Opposition]] against the policies of Stalin and Bukharin but they had lost influence as a result of the party struggles and no longer posed a serious threat to Stalin. In October 1927 Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Central Committee and at the Fifteenth Party Congress held in December 1927 the remaining members of the left opposition were subjected to insults and humiliations and in 1928 Trotsky and the Left Opposition were expelled from the Communist Party itself. 
-
-Stalin now moved against Bukharin by appropriating Trotsky's criticisms of his right wing policies. Stalin now promoted a new [[general line]] favouring collectivization of the peasantry and rapid industrialization of industry forcing Bukharin and his supporters into a [[Right Opposition]].  
-
-At the Central Committee meeting held in July 1928, Bukharin and his supporters argued that Stalin's new policies would cause a breach with the peasantry. Bukharin also alluded to Lenin's Testament. While Bukharin had support from the party organization in Moscow and the leadership of several commisariats Stalin's control of the secretariat was decisive in that it allowed Stalin to manipulate elections to party posts throughout the country giving him control over a large section of the Central Committee. The right opposition was defeated, Bukharin attempted to form an alliance with Kamenev and Zinoviev but it was too late.

-
-==Purge of the Old Bolsheviks==
-
-''Main article: [[Great Purge]].''
-
-In the 1930s other senior Communists, many of whom had been Stalin's allies were removed and many of them were executed or died in mysterious circumstances, including [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. Joseph Stalin instigated a series of purges against senior members of the party, culminating in the [[Great Purge]] of 1935 to 1938, with the key processes known as [[Moscow Trials]]. 
-
-There are theories that purges were initiated as a tool in Stalin's struggle for power. At the 17th [[CPSU Party Congress]] (February [[1934]]) [[Sergei Kirov]] only received three negative votes in the election to the [[Politburo]] showing himself to be the most popular Soviet leader while Stalin received 267 negative votes ranking him the least popular. According to [[Molotov]]'s memoirs as well as other reports, a number of party members at the Congress had approached Kirov with the proposal that he run for the position of [[General Secretary]] against Stalin. 
-
-Whether or not Stalin initiated the Purge as a response to opposition to him within the party and whether or not Stalin was personally behind the assassination of Kirov in December 1934 in order to remove a rival, that was used as a pretext for the Purge, the fact remains that of the 1,966 delegates who attended the 1934 ""Congress of Victors"", 1,108 were ultimately arrested by the secret police.  Of 139 members of the [[Central Committee]], 98 were arrested. 
-
-Ostensibly, the purge began as an investigation into Kirov's murder. [[Zinoviev]] and his former supporters were charged with the murder and subjected to [[show trial]]s before being executed. The ""investigation"" continued and soon found thousands of alleged conspirators who were similarly rounded up and shot or put into [[labor camp]]s. Stalin claimed that Kirov's assassin, [[Leonid Nikolayev]],  was part of a larger conspiracy led by [[Zinoviev]], [[Kamenev]] and ultimately [[Leon Trotsky]] against the Soviet government.
-
-Additional triggers for the purge may have been the refusal by the [[Politburo]] in 1932 to approve the execution of [[M. N. Riutin]], an Old Bolshevik who had distributed a 200-pg pamphlet calling for the removal of Stalin and their refusal in 1933 to approve the execution of [[A.P. Smirnov]], who had been a party member since 1896 and had also been found to be agitating for Stalin&#8217;s removal. 
-
-The failure of the Politburo to act ruthlessly against anti-Stalinists in the Party may have combined in Stalin&#8217;s mind with Kirov&#8217;s growing popularity to convince him of the need to move decisively against his opponents, real or perceived, and destroy them and their reputations as a means of consolidating Stalin and the bureaucracy&#8217;s power over the party and the state.
-
-The [[Moscow Trials]] lasted until 1938 and were used to blame various former oppositionists (as well as numerous supporters of Stalin who were considered suspect for some reason or another) with the failure of Stalin's [[Five Year Plan]] to meet its goals as well as other problems in the Soviet Union. Numerous Bolshevik luminaries such as [[Bukharin]], [[Karl Radek|Radek]], [[Alexei Rykov|Rykov]] and [[Chrisitan Rakovsky|Rakovsky]] were accused of plotting to overthrow Stalin or even conspiring with [[Hitler]] against the USSR and were tried and executed. 
-
-The Great Purge saw the removal of 850,000 members from the Party, or 36% of its membership, between 1936 and 1938. Many of these individuals were executed or perished in prison camps. &#8220;[[Old Bolsheviks]]&#8221; who had been members of the Party in 1917 were especially targeted. 
-
-At the 18th Party Congress was held in 1939, only 2% of the delegates had also been delegates to the last congress held in 1934.

-
-==Stalinism==
-The labor camps were expanded into the infamous [[Gulag]] system under [[Stalin]] in his war against so-called ""class enemies"". [[Stalin]] also undertook massive resettlements of [[Kulak]]s, similarly to the Tsarist penal system of ''ssylka'' (resettlement in remote areas) which had been established to deal with political dissidents and common criminals without executing them.
-
-Under Stalin the meaning of the phrase [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] was transformed from a democracy run by the workers (ie where the working class dictates) to a dictatorship by the party leader over the working class in their name.
-
-As Stalin consolidated his rule the party itself ceased to be a serious deliberative body under Stalin with Party Congresses, particularly after the Great Purge, being little more than show pieces in which delegates would sing the praises of Stalin in what became a [[cult of personality]]. No party congresses were held at all between 1939 and 1952. The role of the secret police became paramount in Soviet society and within the party with party members closely monitored to ensure their adherence to Stalin. Similarly the Central Committee and even the Politburo became rubber stamps for Stalin's dictatorship and without any ability to challenge his power or question his decision.
-
-At the 1952 party congress, Stalin had Molotov removed from the [[Politburo]], he also diluted the power of executive members by replacing the body with a twenty-five member Presidium which was twice the old Politburo's size. However, an informal bureau of the Presidium, less powerful than the old Politburo, was established in order to make decision making more manageable. This bureau consisted of Stalin, [[Beria]], [[Malenkov]], [[Khrushchev]], [[Voroshilov]], [[Kaganovich]], [[Saburov]], [[Peruvkhin]] and [[Bulganin]]. 
-
-''See also: [[Stalinism]]''
-
-==Post-Stalin==
-Stalin's death on March 5, 1953 unleashed a new struggle for succession to the leadership of the party and the country. [[Molotov]] had been widely thought to be Stalin's obvious successor but he had fallen into disfavour during Stalin's final years and had been removed from the Politburo in 1952 (though he was reinstated after Stalin's death). The struggle for succession became a contest between [[Beria]] (the feared leader of the [[NKVD]]), [[Malenkov]] and [[Khrushchev]]. 
-
-At the meeting of the Presidium's inner bureau held immediately after Stalin's death, Beria proposed  Malenkov as Chairman of the Council of Ministers (or Premier). The size of the Presidium was also cut in half in order to remove the influence of the new members that had been appointed in 1952 - the new Presidium had the exact same membership as the old bureau of the Presidium except that Molotov and [[Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan|Mikoyan]] were reinstated. Malenkov also became First Secretary of the Party (as the postion of General Secretary was now known) but had to relinquish that position and leave the party [[Secretariat]] on March 14, 1953 in the name of collective leadership due to the dissatisfaction of others in the leadership with Malenkov's assumption of both leadership roles.
-
-Despite Beria's history as Stalin's most ruthless henchmen, he was at the forefront of destalinization and liberalisation after Stalin's death, possibly as a means of winning support for his campaign to become leader. Beria not only publicly denounced the [[Doctor's Plot]] as a ""fraud"" but he instigated the release of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners from the [[gulag]]s (prisoners he had had a hand in arresting in the first place), brought in a liberal policy towards non-Russian nationalities in the Soviet Union thus reversing decades of [[Russification]] and persuaded the Presidium and the Council of Ministers to urge the [[Ulbricht]] regime in Germany to slow down the ""construction of socialism"" and institute liberal economic and political reforms.  
-
-The surviving party leadership feared Beria and Khrushchev in particular saw him as his most serious rival. He was unable to win conservatives in the Presidium such as Molotov to his side until one of Beria's initiatives, his German policy, resulted in calamity for Soviet power. At Beria's urging the [[East German]] government sent the public signals about an easing up in the regime thus raising expectations but when they equivocated on implementing changes such as cancelling a plan to increase labour production (and thus workload on individual workers) a mass protest movement resulted that threatened the existence of the government and resulted in a hard crackdown using Soviet troops. 
-
-The events in Germany convinced conservatives and supporters of Beria such as Molotov, Malenkov and Bulganin that his policies were dangerous and destabalising to Soviet power (his policy towards the nationalities was seen as a threat to the unity of the USSR itself). Days after the events in Germany, Khrushchev persuaded them to support an effective [[putsch]] against Beria. In June 1953, three months after Stalin's death, the members of the Presidium (the renamed Politburo) under the instigation of Khruschev agreed to ambush Beria at a Presidium meeting surprising him by bringing in army officers to put him under arrest. He was tried and shot in December 1953 though Khrushchev was later to claim that he shot Beria himself at the June meeting of the Presidium. 
-
-With Beria, Malenkov's ally, out of the way, Khrushchev was in a position to outmanouver Malenkov for power. Khrushchev became First Secretary in September, 1953 ushering in a period in which Malenkov and Khrushchev shared power. Khruschev won the support of [[Bulganin]] to move against Malenkov and at the Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was criticized for his close relationship with Beria as well as his failure to implement promises to increase the production of consumer goods. The next month he was dismissed as head of the government. 
-
-The [[Twentieth Party Congress]] held in 1956 marked the party's formal break with Stalin (three years after his death) when First Secretary [[Nikita Khrushchev]] gave his famous ''Secret Speech'' denouncing the crimes and excesses of Stalin. This ushered in a period of [[destalinisation]] which saw an end to the [[personality cult]] which had grown around Stalin, the release of tens of thousands of [[political prisoners]] and a thaw in political and cultural discourse. This was too much for conservatives in the Presidium (the renamed Politburo). Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov and Bulganin attempted to oust Khrushchev in the summer of 1957 and won a vote in the Presidium to oust Khruschev but [[Georgi Zhukov]] the defence minister and war hero, supported Khrushchev's demands that the matter be sent to the Central Committee which overturned the Presidium vote. Khrushchev ousted the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] from the Presidium and ultimately from the party and, in 1958 became Premier while retaining the position of First Secretary.
-
-The execution of Beria also brought the [[NKVD]] and its successor, the [[KGB]] under party control where, under Stalin, the state security apparatus had become more powerful than the party and the military. The reversal caused by Beria's arrest and execution brought to the end much of the arbitrary arrest and the system of forced labour in [[Gulag]]s that had marked the Stalin era. 
-
-Khrushchev attempted to reorganize the party structure in 1962 along economic rather than geographical lines. This led to confusion and the alienation of many party officials. 
-
-Khrushchev's prestige was severely damaged as a result of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] which ended in what many in the party saw as a humiliating climbdown by Khrushchev. He was removed from power in October 1964 by the [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]] due to the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as the failure of his agricultural and industrial policies. Destalinisation came a halt under the new General Secretary, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] who emerged as the new party leader after first plotting with [[Nikolay Podgorny]] to oust Khruschev and then outmanouvering Podgorny to take the party leadership (Podgrony became the ceremonial head of state as a consolation until Brezhnev took that position for himself in 1977). However, there was no return to the policies of terror against party members. While internal party struggles would result in expulsions there were no executions of party members after the execution of [[Beria]] in 1953. When [[Malenkov]], [[Molotov]], [[Kaganovich]] and other members of the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] were expelled from the Presidium and ultimately from the party for allegedly plotting against [[Khruschev]] they were not put on trial or imprisoned but simply demoted to minor posts (such as ambassador to [[Mongolia]] in the case of Molotov) or pensioned off as when Khruschev himself was deposed in 1964. 
-
-Though initially, the USSR was again under a ""collective leadership"", this time of Brezhnev, Podgrony and [[Alexsey Kosygin]] , Brezhnev was able to consolidate power and become the undisputed leader. At the 23rd Party Congress held in 1966, Brezhnev was able to have himself declared General Secretary of the party, reviving a title that had not existed since Stalin. The Presidium also reverted to its previous name of Politburo. While Kosygin attempted to persue a policy of favouring light industry and consumer good production over heavy industry, Brezhnev favoured military expansion which necessitated a continued emphasis on heavy industry. While Kosygin remained Premier, it was Brezhnev's policies that won out and by 1968 he was the undisputed leader of both the party and the country. The Brezhnev period ushered in an unparalleled period of stability in the party, a stability that ultimately led to stagnation. Almost half of the members of the 1981 Central Committee had been on the body in 1966 while the average age of Politburo members rose from 55 in 1966 to 68 in 1982 as the USSR became something of a [[gerentocracy]]. Brezhnev suffered a stroke in 1975 but continued in power despite deteriorating health until his death in November 1982 at the age of 76. His final years were marked by an attempt to create a [[personality cult]] around himself as well as growing corruption within the party as members increasingly paid lip service to socialist ideas and instead saw their positions as a route to self enrichment. 
-

-
-==Gorbachev==
-[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became the party's general secretary in 1985 following an interegnum after Brezhnev's death in 1982 when the party was led first by [[Yuri Andropov]] and then by [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. Unlike previous successions there was no pretence of a ''collective leadership'' replacing Brezhnev. When Brezhnev died Andropov was proclaimed General Secretary within days and by the official coverage in the Soviet media it was clear that he was ''the'' leader. Andropov died on February 9, 1984 and Chernenko was elected his replacement on February 13 but Chernenko was a compromise, stopgap candidate as Gorbachev, Andropov's protege, lacked sufficient support in the Politburo. However, Chernenko he was already an ill man and his duties were increasingly carried out by others, particularly Gorbachev who was nominated by [[Andrei Gromyko]] to become General Secretary when Chernenko died. There are indications Gorbachev may have been in control prior to Chernenko's death as he was announced as the new General Secretary the day after Chernenko died on March 10, 1985.  
-
-Gorbachev instituted policies of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]. Glasnost allowed freedom of speech in the Soviet Union and a flourishing of political debate within the Communist Party to a degree not seen since the [[Russian Revolution]] while perestroika was an attempt to restructure the political and particuarly the economic organisation of the country. This period of liberalisation ultimately ended in the dissolution of the [[Soviet bloc]] in eastern Europe.  
-
-At the Twenty-Seventy Party Congress in 1986, [[Boris Yeltsin]] became a candidate member of the Politburo and offended party members in a speech that attacked the hidden privliges of the party elite. 
-
-At the 1988 Party Conference Gorbachev launched reforms to reduce the party's control over the government including proposals for multicandidate elections to regional and local legislatures and the positions of local and regional party first secretaryships.While Gorbachev was able to receive approval for his reforms from the party, the membership of the CPSU was becoming increasingly resistant to Gorbachev's policies and rather than being a locus for change became a bulwark of conservativism. Increasingly, Gorbachev bypassed the party in order to implement his reforms relying instead on governmental bodies. 
-
-In 1990, Gorbachev obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society. 
-
-By the time of the Twenty-Eighth Party Congress in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, slit into oppsoing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. 
-
-''See: [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)]]''
-
-==End of Communist rule==
-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[August coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before a ''Union Treaty'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservaties.  Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
-
-After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], the party became known as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].

 Stalin's death on March 5, 1953 unleashed a new struggle for succession to the leadership of the party and the country. [[Molotov]] had been widely thought to be Stalin's obvious successor but he had fallen into disfavour during Stalin's final years and had been removed from the Politburo in 1952 (though he was reinstated after Stalin's death). The struggle for succession became a contest between [[Beria]] (the feared leader of the [[NKVD]]), [[Malenkov]] and [[Khrushchev]].

The size of the Presidium was also cut in half in order to remove the influence of the new members that had been appointed in 1952 - the new Presidium had the exact same membership as the old bureau of the Presidium except that Molotov and [[Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan|Mikoyan]] were reinstated. Malenkov also became First Secretary of the Party (as the postion of General Secretary was now known) but had to relinquish that position and leave the party [[Secretariat]] on March 14, 1953 in the name of collective leadership due to the dissatisfaction of others in the leadership with Malenkov's assumption of both leadership roles.

 Despite Beria's history as Stalin's most ruthless henchmen, he was at the forefront of destalinization and liberalisation after Stalin's death, possibly as a means of winning support for his campaign to become leader. Beria not only publicly denounced the [[Doctor's Plot]] as a ""fraud"" but he instigated the release of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners from the [[gulag]]s (prisoners he had had a hand in arresting in the first place), brought in a liberal policy towards non-Russian nationalities in the Soviet Union thus reversing decades of [[Russification]] and persuaded the Presidium and the Council of Ministers to urge the [[Ulbricht]] regime in Germany to slow down the ""construction of socialism"" and institute liberal economic and political reforms.

 Khrushchev's prestige was severely damaged as a result of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] which ended in what many in the party saw as a humiliating climbdown by Khrushchev. He was removed from power in October 1964 by the [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]] due to the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as the failure of his agricultural and industrial policies. Destalinisation came a halt under the new General Secretary, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] who emerged as the new party leader after first plotting with [[Nikolai Podgorny]] to oust Khruschev and then outmanouvering Podgorny to take the party leadership (Podgrony became the ceremonial head of state as a consolation until Brezhnev took that position for himself in 1977). However, there was no return to the policies of terror against party members. While internal party struggles would result in expulsions there were no executions of party members after the execution of [[Beria]] in 1953. When [[Malenkov]], [[Molotov]], [[Kaganovich]] and other members of the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] were expelled from the Presidium and ultimately from the party for allegedly plotting against [[Khruschev]] they were not put on trial or imprisoned but simply demoted to minor posts (such as ambassador to [[Mongolia]] in the case of Molotov) or pensioned off as when Khruschev himself was deposed in 1964.

 The events in Germany convinced conservatives and supporters of Beria such as Molotov, Malenkov and Bulganin that his policies were dangerous and destabalising to Soviet power (his policy towards the nationalities was seen as a threat to the unity of the USSR itself). Days after the events in Germany, Khrushchev persuaded them to support an effective [[putsch]] against Beria. In June 1953, three months after Stalin's death, the members of the Presidium (the renamed Politburo) under the instigation of Khruschev agreed to ambush Beria at a Presidium meeting surprising him by bringing in army officers to put him under arrest. He was tried and shot in December 1953 though Khrushchev was later to claim that he shot Beria himself at the June meeting of the Presidium.

 The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the CPSU|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]].

 Stalin's death on March 5, 1953 unleashed a new struggle for succession to the leadership of the party and the country. [[Molotov]] had been widely thought to be Stalin's obvious successor but he had fallen into disfavour during Stalin's final years and had been removed from the Politburo in 1952 (though he was reinstated after Stalin's death).

 Meanwhile the campaign against Trotsky intensified and he was removed from the position of [[People's Commissar]] of War before the end of the year. In 1925, Trotsky was denounced for his essay ''Lessons of October'' which criticised Zinoviev and Kamenev for initially opposing Lenin's plans for an insurrection in 1917. Trotsky was also denounced for his theory of [[permanent revolution]] which contradicted Stalin's position that [[socialism in one country|socialism could be built in one country]], Russia, without a worldwide revolution. As the prospects for a revolution in Europe, particularly Germany, became increasingly dim through the 1920s, Trotsky's theoretical position began to look increasingly pessimistic as far as the success of Russian socialism was concerned. 
 
-With the resignation of Trotsky as War Commissar the unity of the troika began to unravel. Zinoviev and Kamenev again began to fear Stalin's power and felt that their positions were threatened. Stalin moved to form an alliance with [[Bukharin]] and his allies on the right of the party who supported the [[New Economic Policy]] and encouraged a slowdown in industrialisation efforts and a move towards encouraging the peasants to increase production via market incentives. Zinoviev and Kamenev denounced this policy as a return to capitalism. The conflict erupted at hte Fourteenth Party Congress held in December 1925 with Zinoviev and Kamenev now protesting against the dictatorial policies of Stalin and trying to revive the issue of [[Lenin's Testament]] which they had previously buried. Stalin now used Trotsky's previous criticisms of Zinoviev and Kamenev to defeat and demote them and bring in allies like [[Molotov]], [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]] and [[Mikhail Kalinin]]. Trotsky was dropped from the politburo entirely in 1926. The Fourteenth Congress also saw the first developments of the Stalin personality cult with Stalin being referred to as ""leader"" for the first time and becoming the subject of effusive praise from delegates.

 [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became the party's general secretary in 1985 following an interegnum after Brezhnev's death in 1982 when the party was led first by [[Yuri Andropov]] and then by [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. Unlike previous successions there was no pretence of a ''collective leadership'' replacing Brezhnev. When Brezhnev died Andropov was proclaimed General Secretary within days and by the official coverage in the Soviet media it was clear that he was ''the'' leader. Andropov died on February 9, 1984 and Chernenko was elected his replacement on February 13 but Chernenko was a compromise, stopgap candidate as Gorbachev, Andropov's protege, lacked sufficient support in the Politburo. However, Chernenko he was already an ill man and his duties were increasingly carried out by others, particularly Gorbachev who was nominated by [[Andrei Gromyko]] to become General Secretary when Chernenko died. There are indications Gorbachev may have been in control prior to Chernenko's death as he was announced as the new General Secretary the day after Chernenko died on March 10, 1985.  
 
-Gorbachev instituted policies of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]. Glasnost allowed freedom of speech in the Soviet Union and a flourishing of political debate within the Communist Party to a degree not seen since the [[Russian Revolution]] while perestroika was an attempt to restructure the political and particuarly the economic organisation of the country.

 Khrushchev's prestige was severely damaged as a result of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] which ended in what many in the party saw as a humiliating climbdown by Khrushchev. He was removed from power in October 1964 by the [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]] due to the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as the failure of his agricultural and industrial policies. Destalinisation came a halt under the new General Secretary, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] who emerged as the new party leader after first plotting with [[Nikolai Podgorny]] to oust Khruschev and then outmanouvering Podgorny to take the party leadership (Podgrony became the ceremonial head of state as a consolation until Brezhnev took that position for himself in 1977). However, there was no return to the policies of terror against party members. While internal party struggles would result in expulsions there were no executions of party members after the execution of [[Beria]] in 1953. When [[Malenkov]], [[Molotov]], [[Kaganovich]] and other members of the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] were expelled from the Presidium and ultimately from the party for allegedly plotting against [[Khruschev]] they were not put on trial or imprisoned but simply demoted to minor posts (such as ambassador to [[Mongolia]] in the case of Molotov) or pensioned off as when Khruschev himself was deposed in 1964.

At the 23rd Party Congress held in 1966, Brezhnev was able to have himself declared General Secretary of the party, reviving a title that had not existed since Stalin. The Presidium also reverted to its previous name of Politburo. While Kosygin attempted to pursue a policy of favouring light industry and consumer good production over heavy industry, Brezhnev favoured military expansion which necessitated a continued emphasis on heavy industry. While Kosygin remained Premier, it was Brezhnev's policies that won out and by 1968 he was the undisputed leader of both the party and the country. The Brezhnev period ushered in an unparalleled period of stability in the party, a stability that ultimately led to stagnation. Almost half of the members of the 1981 Central Committee had been on the body in 1966 while the average age of Politburo members rose from 55 in 1966 to 68 in 1982.

Brezhnev suffered a stroke in 1975 but continued in power despite deteriorating health until his death in November 1982 at the age of 76. His final years were marked by an attempt to create a [[personality cult]] around himself as well as growing corruption within the party as members increasingly paid lip service to socialist ideas and instead saw their positions as a route to self enrichment.

 The events in Germany convinced conservatives and supporters of Beria such as Molotov, Malenkov and Bulganin that his policies were dangerous and destabalising to Soviet power (his policy towards the nationalities was seen as a threat to the unity of the USSR itself). Days after the events in Germany, Khrushchev persuaded them to support an effective [[putsch]] against Beria.

 Khrushchev's prestige was severely damaged as a result of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] which ended in what many in the party saw as a humiliating climbdown by Khrushchev. He was removed from power in October 1964 by the [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]] due to the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as the failure of his agricultural and industrial policies. Destalinisation came a halt under the new General Secretary, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] who emerged as the new party leader after first plotting with [[Nikolai Podgorny]] to oust Khruschev and then outmanouvering Podgorny to take the party leadership (Podgrony became the ceremonial head of state as a consolation until Brezhnev took that position for himself in 1977). However, there was no return to the policies of terror against party members. While internal party struggles would result in expulsions there were no executions of party members after the execution of [[Beria]] in 1953. When [[Malenkov]], [[Molotov]], [[Kaganovich]] and other members of the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] were expelled from the Presidium and ultimately from the party for allegedly plotting against [[Khruschev]] they were not put on trial or imprisoned but simply demoted to minor posts (such as ambassador to [[Mongolia]] in the case of Molotov) or pensioned off as when Khruschev himself was deposed in 1964. 
 
-Though initially, the USSR was again under a ""collective leadership"", this time of Brezhnev as General Secretary, [[Podgorny]] as [[President of the Soviet Union]] and [[Alexsey Kosygin]] as [[Premier of the Soviet Union]]. Brezhnev was able to consolidate power and become the undisputed leader. At the 23rd Party Congress held in 1966, Brezhnev was able to have himself declared General Secretary of the party, reviving a title that had not existed since Stalin. The Presidium also reverted to its previous name of Politburo. While Kosygin attempted to pursue a policy of favouring light industry and consumer good production over heavy industry, Brezhnev favoured military expansion which necessitated a continued emphasis on heavy industry. While Kosygin remained Premier, it was Brezhnev's policies that won out and by 1968 he was the undisputed leader of both the party and the country. The Brezhnev period ushered in an unparalleled period of stability in the party, a stability that ultimately led to stagnation. Almost half of the members of the 1981 Central Committee had been on the body in 1966 while the average age of Politburo members rose from 55 in 1966 to 68 in 1982. This kind of USSR leadership has become informally known as [[gerontocracy]]. Brezhnev suffered a stroke in 1975 but continued in power despite deteriorating health until his death in November 1982 at the age of 76. His final years were marked by an attempt to create a [[personality cult]] around himself as well as growing corruption within the party as members increasingly paid lip service to socialist ideas and instead saw their positions as a route to self enrichment.

 Despite Beria's history as Stalin's most ruthless henchmen, he was at the forefront of [[destalinization]] and liberalisation after Stalin's death, possibly as a means of winning support for his campaign to become leader. Beria not only publicly denounced the [[Doctors' plot]] as a ""fraud"" but he instigated the release of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners from the [[gulag]]s (prisoners he had had a hand in arresting in the first place), brought in a liberal policy towards non-Russian nationalities in the Soviet Union thus reversing decades of [[Russification]] and persuaded the Presidium and the Council of Ministers to urge the [[Ulbricht]] regime in Germany to slow down the ""construction of socialism"" and institute liberal economic and political reforms.  
 
-The surviving party leadership feared Beria and Khrushchev in particular saw him as his most serious rival. Khruschev was unable to win conservatives in the Presidium such as Molotov to his side until one of Beria's initiatives, his German policy, resulted in calamity for Soviet power. At Beria's urging the [[East German]] government sent the public signals about an easing up in the regime thus raising expectations but when they equivocated on implementing changes such as cancelling a plan to increase labour production (and thus workload on individual workers) a mass protest movement resulted that threatened the existence of the government and resulted in a hard crackdown using Soviet troops (see [[Workers Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]]).

Days after the events in Germany, Khrushchev persuaded them to support an effective [[putsch]] against Beria.

-The [[Twentieth Party Congress]] held in 1956 marked the party's formal break with Stalin (three years after his death) when First Secretary [[Nikita Khrushchev]] gave his famous ''[[Secret Speech]]'' denouncing the crimes and excesses of Stalin. This ushered in a period of [[destalinisation]] which saw an end to the [[personality cult]] which had grown around Stalin, the release of tens of thousands of [[political prisoners]] and a thaw in political and cultural discourse. This was too much for conservatives in the Presidium (the renamed Politburo). Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov and Bulganin attempted to oust Khrushchev in the summer of 1957 and won a vote in the Presidium to oust Khruschev but [[Georgy Zhukov]] the defence minister and war hero, supported Khrushchev's demands that the matter be sent to the Central Committee which overturned the Presidium vote. Khrushchev ousted the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] from the Presidium and ultimately from the party and, in 1958 became Premier while retaining the position of First Secretary.

 The execution of Beria also brought the [[NKVD]] and its successor, the [[KGB]] under party control where, under Stalin, the state security apparatus had become more powerful than the party and the military. The reversal caused by Beria's arrest and execution brought to the end much of the arbitrary arrest and the system of forced labour in [[Gulag]]s that had marked the Stalin era. 
 
 Khrushchev attempted to reorganize the party structure in 1962 along economic rather than geographical lines. This led to confusion and the alienation of many party officials.

Beria not only publicly denounced the [[Doctors' plot]] as a ""fraud"" but he instigated the release of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners from the [[gulag]]s (prisoners he had had a hand in arresting in the first place), brought in a liberal policy towards non-Russian nationalities in the Soviet Union thus reversing decades of [[Russification]] and persuaded the Presidium and the Council of Ministers to urge the [[Ulbricht]] regime in Germany to slow down the ""construction of socialism"" and institute liberal economic and political reforms.  
 
 The surviving party leadership feared Beria and Khrushchev in particular saw him as his most serious rival. Khruschev was unable to win conservatives in the Presidium such as Molotov to his side until one of Beria's initiatives, his German policy, resulted in calamity for Soviet power. At Beria's urging the [[East German]] government sent the public signals about an easing up in the regime thus raising expectations but when they equivocated on implementing changes such as cancelling a plan to increase labour production (and thus workload on individual workers) a mass protest movement resulted that threatened the existence of the government and resulted in a hard crackdown using Soviet troops (see [[Workers Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]]).

 Khrushchev's prestige was severely damaged as a result of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] which ended in what many in the party saw as a humiliating climbdown by Khrushchev. He was removed from power in October 1964 by the [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]] due to the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as the failure of his agricultural and industrial policies. Destalinisation came a halt under the new General Secretary, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] who emerged as the new party leader after first plotting with [[Nikolai Podgorny]] to oust Khruschev and then outmanouvering Podgorny to take the party leadership (Podgrony became the ceremonial head of state as a consolation until Brezhnev took that position for himself in 1977). However, there was no return to the policies of terror against party members. While internal party struggles would result in expulsions there were no executions of party members after the execution of [[Beria]] in 1953. When [[Malenkov]], [[Molotov]], [[Kaganovich]] and other members of the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] were expelled from the Presidium and ultimately from the party for allegedly plotting against [[Khruschev]] they were not put on trial or imprisoned but simply demoted to minor posts (such as ambassador to [[Mongolia]] in the case of Molotov) or pensioned off as when Khruschev himself was deposed in 1964.

While Kosygin remained Premier, it was Brezhnev's policies that won out and by 1968 he was the undisputed leader of both the party and the country. The Brezhnev period ushered in an unparalleled period of stability in the party, a stability that ultimately led to stagnation. Almost half of the members of the 1981 Central Committee had been on the body in 1966 while the average age of Politburo members rose from 55 in 1966 to 68 in 1982 as the USSR became something of a [[gerentocracy]]. Brezhnev suffered a stroke in 1975 but continued in power despite deteriorating health until his death in November 1982 at the age of 76. His final years were marked by an attempt to create a [[personality cult]] around himself as well as growing corruption within the party as members increasingly paid lip service to socialist ideas and instead saw their positions as a route to self enrichment.

 The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the CPSU|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
 
 In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress, however, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary.

 As Stalin consolidated his rule the party itself ceased to be a serious deliberative body under Stalin with Party Congresses, particularly after the Great Purge, being little more than show pieces in which delegates would sing the praises of Stalin in what became a [[cult of personality]]. No party congresses were held at all between 1939 and 1952. The role of the secret police became paramount in Soviet society and within the party with party members closely monitored to ensure their adherence to Stalin. Similarly the Central Committee and even the Politburo became rubber stamps for Stalin's dictatorship and without any ability to challenge his power or question his decision.
 
-At the 1952 party congress, Stalin had Molotov removed from the [[Politburo]], he also diluted the power of executive members by replacing the body with a twenty-five member Presidium which was twice the old Politburo's size.

 Meanwhile the campaign against Trotsky intensified and he was removed from the position of [[People's Commissar]] of War before the end of the year. In 1925, Trotsky was denounced for his essay ''Lessons of October'' which criticised Zinoviev and Kamenev for initially opposing Lenin's plans for an insurrection in 1917. Trotsky was also denounced for his theory of [[permanent revolution]] which contradicted Stalin's position that [[socialism in one country|socialism could be built in one country]], Russia, without a worldwide revolution. As the prospects for a revolution in Europe, particularly Germany, became increasingly dim through the 1920s, Trotsky's theoretical position began to look increasingly pessimistic as far as the success of Russian socialism was concerned.

Stalin moved to form an alliance with [[Bukharin]] and his allies on the right of the party who supported the [[New Economic Policy]] and encouraged a slowdown in industrialisation efforts and a move towards encouraging the peasants to increase production via market incentives. Zinoviev and Kamenev denounced this policy as a return to capitalism. The conflict erupted at the Fourteenth Party Congress held in December 1925 with Zinoviev and Kamenev now protesting against the dictatorial policies of Stalin and trying to revive the issue of [[Lenin's Testament]] which they had previously buried. Stalin now used Trotsky's previous criticisms of Zinoviev and Kamenev to defeat and demote them and bring in allies like [[Molotov]], [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]] and [[Mikhail Kalinin]]. Trotsky was dropped from the politburo entirely in 1926. The Fourteenth Congress also saw the first developments of the Stalin personality cult with Stalin being referred to as ""leader"" for the first time and becoming the subject of effusive praise from delegates.

 Whether or not Stalin initiated the Purge as a response to opposition to him within the party and whether or not Stalin was personally behind the assassination of Kirov in December 1934 in order to remove a rival, that was used as a pretext for the Purge, the fact remains that of the 1,966 delegates who attended the 1934 ""Congress of Victors"", 1,108 were ultimately arrested by the secret police.

The Brezhnev period ushered in an unparalleled period of stability in the party, a stability that ultimately led to stagnation. Almost half of the members of the 1981 Central Committee had been on the body in 1966 while the average age of Politburo members rose from 55 in 1966 to 68 in 1982. The aging Soviet leadership led to its being described as a [[gerontocracy]]. Brezhnev suffered a stroke in 1975 but continued in power despite deteriorating health until his death in November 1982 at the age of 76. His final years were marked by an attempt to create a [[personality cult]] around himself as well as growing corruption within the party as members increasingly paid lip service to socialist ideas and instead saw their positions as a route to self enrichment.

 The failure of the Politburo to act ruthlessly against anti-Stalinists in the Party may have combined in Stalin&#8217;s mind with Kirov&#8217;s growing popularity to convince him of the need to move decisively against his opponents, real or perceived, and destroy them and their reputations as a means of consolidating Stalin and the bureaucracy&#8217;s power over the party and the state.

 Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege with Communist Party members becoming an elite, or [[nomenklatura]], in Soviet society. Members of the nomenklatura would enjoy special privileges such as shopping at well-stocked stores, have preference in obtaining housing and access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities and obtain prestigious jobs for them. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
 
 Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.",,Altenmann,2004-10-29T03:23:08Z,"The change made is a rephrasing of the section header from ""==Membership=="" to ""===Membership==="".

Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Brezhnev]] in 1966.

 For most of the history of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was virtually indistinguishable from the government and was the only political party tolerated by the government and its security forces. Consequently, the history of the USSR and the CPSU are deeply intertwined and overlapping. Therefore, it is useful for those interested in the history of the CPSU to also consult the [[History of Russia]] series of articles.

 ==End of Communist rule==
 The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before a ''Union Treaty'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives.  Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

 When the Bolsheviks became the ''All-Russian Communist Party'' it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.

 == History ==
-===Civil War===
-Initially, following the [[Russian Revolution]], the Bolsheviks dealt leniently with ""enemies of the revolution"", in one case releasing a tsarist general if he agreed not to join the ''Whites''. He agreed and promptly joined the counter-revolution on his release. As the Civil War progressed, and particularly after the attempted assassination of Lenin on August 30, [[1918]] by [[Fanya Kaplan]] of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]], the Bolsheviks became more ruthless with political enemies by instituting the [[Red Terror]], although their counter-revolutionary opponents used equally violent methods against suspected Bolsheviks and their partisans. 
+''Main article: [[History of the CPSU]]''
 
-The execution of ex-Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and his family on [[July 16]], [[1918]] on the orders of the [[Yekaterinburg]] [[soviet (council)|soviet]] caused a particularly strong reaction from foreign governments. 
+History of the Communist Party of the Societ Union was to a significant degree depermined by a person who was the head of the party in particular periods of time.
 
-In December 1917, the Bolshevik government established a security force, the [[Cheka]], which took over the role of the former Tsarist [[Okhranka]]. In [[1918]], the Communist government began to send political opponents to [[labor camp|forced labor camp]]s, typically in [[Siberia]] and the extreme North of Russia. The labor camps were inherited from the Tsarist penal system of forced labour (''[[katorga]]'').

-
-===Tenth Party Congress===
-The party initially allowed free and open debate at party meetings, but this changed due to the Civil War. At the [[Tenth Party Congress]] of 1921, factions were banned in the party, including the ''[[Workers' Opposition]]'', and in 1922 the Communist Party became the only legal political party.
-
-===Stalin's Rise to Power===
-The authority of the party increased as a result, as did its control over the government and within the party the power of the Politburo grew. Stalin was appointed [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] in April 1922. 
-
-The next month Lenin suffered his first [[stroke]] and the question of who would be his successor became paramount as his health deteriorated. Lenin's role in government declined. He suffered a second stroke in December 1922 and the [[Politburo]] ordered that he be kept in isolation. His third stroke in March 1923 left him bedridden and unable to speak though he was still able to communicate through writing. Lenin finally died as the result of a fourth stroke in January 1924.  
-
-As a result of Lenin's illness, the position of [[general secretary]] became more important than had originally been envisioned and Stalin's power grew. Following Lenin's third stroke a [[triumvirate|troika]] made up of Stalin, [[Zinoviev]] and [[Kamenev]] emerged to take day to day leadership of the party and the country and try to block [[Trotsky]] from taking power. Lenin, however, had became increasingly uneasy about Stalin and, following his December 1922 stroke dictated a letter to the party criticising him and urging his removal as general secretary. Stalin was aware of [[Lenin's Testament]] and acted to keep Lenin in isolation for health reasons and increase his control over the party apparatus. 
-
-Zinoviev and [[Bukharin]] became concerned about Stalin's increasing power and proposed that the [[Orgburo]] which Stalin, but no other members of the [[Politburo]], be abolished and that Zinoviev and Trotsky be added to the party secretariat thus diminishing Stalin's role as general secretary. Stalin reacted furiously and the Orgburo was retained but [[Bukharin]], [[Trotsky]] and [[Zinoviev]] were added to the body. 
-
-Due to growing political differences with Trotsky and his [[Left Opposition]] in the fall of 1923, the troika of Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev reunited. At the Twelfth Party Congress in 1923, Trotsky failed to use [[Lenin's Testament]] as a tool against Stalin for fear of endangering the stability of the party. 
-
-Lenin died in January 1924 and in May his Testament was read aloud at the [[Central Committee]] but Zinoviev and Kamenev argued that Lenin's objections had proven groundless and that Stalin should remain General Secretary. The Central Committee decided not to publish the testament. 
-
-Meanwhile the campaign against Trotsky intensified and he was removed from the position of [[People's Commissar]] of War before the end of the year. In 1925, Trotsky was denounced for his essay ''Lessons of October'' which criticised Zinoviev and Kamenev for initially opposing Lenin's plans for an insurrection in 1917. Trotsky was also denounced for his theory of [[permanent revolution]] which contradicted Stalin's position that [[socialism in one country|socialism could be built in one country]], Russia, without a worldwide revolution. As the prospects for a revolution in Europe, particularly Germany, became increasingly dim through the 1920s, Trotsky's theoretical position began to look increasingly pessimistic as far as the success of Russian socialism was concerned. 
-
-With the resignation of Trotsky as War Commissar the unity of the troika began to unravel. Zinoviev and Kamenev again began to fear Stalin's power and felt that their positions were threatened. Stalin moved to form an alliance with [[Bukharin]] and his allies on the right of the party who supported the [[New Economic Policy]] and encouraged a slowdown in industrialisation efforts and a move towards encouraging the peasants to increase production via market incentives. Zinoviev and Kamenev denounced this policy as a return to capitalism. The conflict erupted at the Fourteenth Party Congress held in December 1925 with Zinoviev and Kamenev now protesting against the dictatorial policies of Stalin and trying to revive the issue of [[Lenin's Testament]] which they had previously buried. Stalin now used Trotsky's previous criticisms of Zinoviev and Kamenev to defeat and demote them and bring in allies like [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]], [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]] and [[Mikhail Kalinin]]. Trotsky was dropped from the politburo entirely in 1926. The Fourteenth Congress also saw the first developments of the Stalin personality cult with Stalin being referred to as ""leader"" for the first time and becoming the subject of effusive praise from delegates.
-
-Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev formed a [[United Opposition]] against the policies of Stalin and Bukharin but they had lost influence as a result of the party struggles and no longer posed a serious threat to Stalin. In October 1927 Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Central Committee and at the Fifteenth Party Congress held in December 1927 the remaining members of the left opposition were subjected to insults and humiliations and in 1928 Trotsky and the Left Opposition were expelled from the Communist Party itself. 
-
-Stalin now moved against Bukharin by appropriating Trotsky's criticisms of his right wing policies. Stalin now promoted a new [[general line]] favouring collectivization of the peasantry and rapid industrialization of industry forcing Bukharin and his supporters into a [[Right Opposition]].  
-
-At the Central Committee meeting held in July 1928, Bukharin and his supporters argued that Stalin's new policies would cause a breach with the peasantry. Bukharin also alluded to Lenin's Testament. While Bukharin had support from the party organization in Moscow and the leadership of several commisariats Stalin's control of the secretariat was decisive in that it allowed Stalin to manipulate elections to party posts throughout the country giving him control over a large section of the Central Committee. The right opposition was defeated, Bukharin attempted to form an alliance with Kamenev and Zinoviev but it was too late.

-===Purge of the Old Bolsheviks===
-
-''Main article: [[Great Purge]].''
-
-In the 1930s other senior Communists, many of whom had been Stalin's allies were removed and many of them were executed or died in mysterious circumstances, including [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. Joseph Stalin instigated a series of purges against senior members of the party, culminating in the [[Great Purge]] of 1935 to 1938, with the key processes known as [[Moscow Trials]]. 
-
-There are theories that purges were initiated as a tool in Stalin's struggle for power. At the 17th [[CPSU Party Congress]] (February [[1934]]) [[Sergei Kirov]] only received three negative votes in the election to the [[Politburo]] showing himself to be the most popular Soviet leader while Stalin received 267 negative votes ranking him the least popular. According to Molotov's memoirs as well as other reports, a number of party members at the Congress had approached Kirov with the proposal that he run for the position of [[General Secretary]] against Stalin. 
-
-Whether or not Stalin initiated the Purge as a response to opposition to him within the party and whether or not Stalin was personally behind the assassination of Kirov in December 1934 in order to remove a rival, that was used as a pretext for the Purge, the fact remains that of the 1,966 delegates who attended the 1934 ""Congress of Victors"", 1,108 were ultimately arrested by the secret police.  Of 139 members of the [[Central Committee]], 98 were arrested. 
-
-Ostensibly, the purge began as an investigation into Kirov's murder. [[Zinoviev]] and his former supporters were charged with the murder and subjected to [[show trial]]s before being executed. The ""investigation"" continued and soon found thousands of alleged conspirators who were similarly rounded up and shot or put into [[labor camp]]s. Stalin claimed that Kirov's assassin, [[Leonid Nikolayev]],  was part of a larger conspiracy led by [[Zinoviev]], [[Kamenev]] and ultimately [[Leon Trotsky]] against the Soviet government.
-
-Additional triggers for the purge may have been the refusal by the [[Politburo]] in 1932 to approve the execution of [[M. N. Riutin]], an Old Bolshevik who had distributed a 200-pg pamphlet calling for the removal of Stalin and their refusal in 1933 to approve the execution of [[A.P. Smirnov]], who had been a party member since 1896 and had also been found to be agitating for Stalin&#8217;s removal. 
-
-The failure of the Politburo to act ruthlessly against anti-Stalinists in the Party may have combined in Stalin&#8217;s mind with Kirov&#8217;s growing popularity to convince him of the need to move decisively against his opponents, real or perceived, and destroy them and their reputations as a means of consolidating Stalin and the bureaucracy&#8217;s power over the party and the state.
-
-The [[Moscow Trials]] lasted until 1938 and were used to blame various former oppositionists (as well as numerous supporters of Stalin who were considered suspect for some reason or another) with the failure of Stalin's [[Five Year Plan]] to meet its goals as well as other problems in the Soviet Union. Numerous Bolshevik luminaries such as [[Bukharin]], [[Karl Radek|Radek]], [[Alexei Rykov|Rykov]] and [[Christian Rakovsky|Rakovsky]] were accused of plotting to overthrow Stalin or even conspiring with [[Hitler]] against the USSR and were tried and executed. 
-
-The Great Purge saw the removal of 850,000 members from the Party, or 36% of its membership, between 1936 and 1938. Many of these individuals were executed or perished in prison camps. &#8220;[[Old Bolsheviks]]&#8221; who had been members of the Party in 1917 were especially targeted. 
-
-At the 18th Party Congress was held in 1939, only 2% of the delegates had also been delegates to the last congress held in 1934.

-===Stalinism===
-''Main article: [[Stalinism]].''
-
-The labor camps were expanded into the infamous [[Gulag]] system under [[Stalin]] in his war against so-called ""class enemies"". [[Stalin]] also undertook massive resettlements of [[Kulak]]s, similarly to the Tsarist penal system of ''ssylka'' (resettlement in remote areas) which had been established to deal with political dissidents and common criminals without executing them.
-
-Under Stalin the meaning of the phrase [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] was transformed from a democracy run by the workers (ie where the working class dictates) to a dictatorship by the party leader over the working class in their name.
-
-As Stalin consolidated his rule the party itself ceased to be a serious deliberative body under Stalin with Party Congresses, particularly after the Great Purge, being little more than show pieces in which delegates would sing the praises of Stalin in what became a [[cult of personality]]. No party congresses were held at all between 1939 and 1952. The role of the secret police became paramount in Soviet society and within the party with party members closely monitored to ensure their adherence to Stalin. Similarly the Central Committee and even the Politburo became rubber stamps for Stalin's dictatorship and without any ability to challenge his power or question his decision.
-
-At the 1952 party congress, Stalin had Molotov removed from the [[Politburo]], he also diluted the power of executive members by replacing the body with a twenty-five member Presidium which was twice the old Politburo's size. However, an informal bureau of the Presidium, less powerful than the old Politburo, was established in order to make decision making more manageable. This bureau consisted of Stalin, [[Beria]], [[Malenkov]], [[Khrushchev]], [[Voroshilov]], [[Kaganovich]], [[Saburov]], [[Peruvkhin]] and [[Bulganin]].
-
-===Post-Stalin===
-Stalin's death on March 5, 1953 unleashed a new struggle for succession to the leadership of the party and the country. Molotov had been widely thought to be Stalin's obvious successor but he had fallen into disfavour during Stalin's final years and had been removed from the Politburo in 1952 (though he was reinstated after Stalin's death). The struggle for succession became a contest between [[Beria]] (the feared leader of the [[NKVD]]), [[Malenkov]] and [[Khrushchev]]. 
-
-At the meeting of the Presidium's inner bureau held immediately after Stalin's death, Beria proposed  Malenkov as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman of the Council of Ministers]] (or Premier). The size of the Presidium was also cut in half in order to remove the influence of the new members that had been appointed in 1952 - the new Presidium had the exact same membership as the old bureau of the Presidium except that Molotov and [[Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan|Mikoyan]] were reinstated. Malenkov also became First Secretary of the Party (as the position of General Secretary was now known) but had to relinquish that position and leave the party [[Secretariat]] on March 14, 1953 in the name of collective leadership due to the dissatisfaction of others in the leadership with Malenkov's assumption of both leadership roles.
-
-Despite Beria's history as Stalin's most ruthless henchmen, he was at the forefront of [[destalinization]] and liberalisation after Stalin's death, possibly as a means of winning support for his campaign to become leader. Beria not only publicly denounced the [[Doctors' plot]] as a ""fraud"" but he instigated the release of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners from the [[gulag]]s (prisoners he had had a hand in arresting in the first place), brought in a liberal policy towards non-Russian nationalities in the Soviet Union thus reversing decades of [[Russification]] and persuaded the Presidium and the Council of Ministers to urge the [[Ulbricht]] regime in Germany to slow down the ""construction of socialism"" and institute liberal economic and political reforms.  
-
-The surviving party leadership feared Beria and Khrushchev in particular saw him as his most serious rival. Khrushchev was unable to win conservatives in the Presidium such as Molotov to his side until one of Beria's initiatives, his German policy, resulted in calamity for Soviet power. At Beria's urging the [[East German]] government sent the public signals about an easing up in the regime thus raising expectations but when they equivocated on implementing changes such as cancelling a plan to increase labour production (and thus workload on individual workers) a mass protest movement resulted that threatened the existence of the government and resulted in a hard crackdown using Soviet troops (see [[Workers Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]]). 
-
-The events in Germany convinced conservatives and supporters of Beria such as Molotov, Malenkov and Bulganin that his policies were dangerous and destabalising to Soviet power (his policy towards the nationalities was seen as a threat to the unity of the USSR itself). Days after the events in Germany, Khrushchev persuaded them to support an effective [[putsch]] against Beria. In June 1953, three months after Stalin's death, the members of the Presidium (the renamed Politburo) under the instigation of Khrushchev agreed to ambush Beria at a Presidium meeting surprising him by bringing in army officers to put him under arrest. He was tried and shot in December 1953 though Khrushchev was later to claim that he shot Beria himself at the June meeting of the Presidium. 
-
-With Beria, Malenkov's ally, out of the way, Khrushchev was in a position to outmanouver Malenkov for power. Khrushchev became First Secretary in September, 1953 ushering in a period in which Malenkov and Khrushchev shared power. Khrushchev won the support of [[Bulganin]] to move against Malenkov and at the Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was criticized for his close relationship with Beria as well as his failure to implement promises to increase the production of consumer goods. The next month he was dismissed as head of the government. 
-
-The [[Twentieth Party Congress]] held in 1956 marked the party's formal break with Stalin (three years after his death) when First Secretary [[Nikita Khrushchev]] gave his famous ''[[Secret Speech]]'' denouncing the crimes and excesses of Stalin. This ushered in a period of [[destalinisation]] which saw an end to the [[personality cult]] which had grown around Stalin, the release of tens of thousands of [[political prisoners]] and a thaw in political and cultural discourse. This was too much for conservatives in the Presidium (the renamed Politburo). Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov and Bulganin attempted to oust Khrushchev in the summer of 1957 and won a vote in the Presidium to oust Khrushchev but [[Georgy Zhukov]] the defence minister and war hero, supported Khrushchev's demands that the matter be sent to the Central Committee which overturned the Presidium vote. Khrushchev ousted the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] from the Presidium and ultimately from the party and, in 1958 became Premier while retaining the position of First Secretary.
-
-The execution of Beria also brought the [[NKVD]] and its successor, the [[KGB]] under party control where, under Stalin, the state security apparatus had become more powerful than the party and the military. The reversal caused by Beria's arrest and execution brought to the end much of the arbitrary arrest and the system of forced labour in [[Gulag]]s that had marked the Stalin era. 
-
-Khrushchev attempted to reorganize the party structure in 1962 along economic rather than geographical lines. This led to confusion and the alienation of many party officials. 
-
-Khrushchev's prestige was severely damaged as a result of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] which ended in what many in the party saw as a humiliating climbdown by Khrushchev. He was removed from power in October 1964 by the [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]] due to the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as the failure of his agricultural and industrial policies. Destalinisation came a halt under the new General Secretary, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] who emerged as the new party leader after first plotting with [[Nikolai Podgorny]] to oust Khrushchev and then outmanouvering Podgorny to take the party leadership (Podgrony became the ceremonial head of state as a consolation until Brezhnev took that position for himself in 1977). However, there was no return to the policies of terror against party members. While internal party struggles would result in expulsions there were no executions of party members after the execution of [[Beria]] in 1953. When [[Malenkov]], Molotov, Kaganovich and other members of the so-called [[Anti-Party Group]] were expelled from the Presidium and ultimately from the party for allegedly plotting against Khrushchev they were not put on trial or imprisoned but simply demoted to minor posts (such as ambassador to [[Mongolia]] in the case of Molotov) or pensioned off as when Khrushchev himself was deposed in 1964. 
-
-Though initially, the USSR was again under a ""collective leadership"", this time of Brezhnev as General Secretary, [[Podgorny]] as [[President of the Soviet Union]] and [[Alexsey Kosygin]] as [[Premier of the Soviet Union]]. Brezhnev was able to consolidate power and become the undisputed leader. At the 23rd Party Congress held in 1966, Brezhnev was able to have himself declared General Secretary of the party, reviving a title that had not existed since Stalin. The Presidium also reverted to its previous name of Politburo. While Kosygin attempted to pursue a policy of favouring light industry and consumer good production over heavy industry, Brezhnev favoured military expansion which necessitated a continued emphasis on heavy industry. While Kosygin remained Premier, it was Brezhnev's policies that won out and by 1968 he was the undisputed leader of both the party and the country. The Brezhnev period ushered in an unparalleled period of stability in the party, a stability that ultimately led to stagnation. Almost half of the members of the 1981 Central Committee had been on the body in 1966 while the average age of Politburo members rose from 55 in 1966 to 68 in 1982. The aging Soviet leadership led to its being described as a [[gerontocracy]]. Brezhnev suffered a stroke in 1975 but continued in power despite deteriorating health until his death in November 1982 at the age of 76. His final years were marked by an attempt to create a [[personality cult]] around himself as well as growing corruption within the party as members increasingly paid lip service to socialist ideas and instead saw their positions as a route to self enrichment.

-
-===Gorbachev===
-[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became the party's general secretary in 1985 following an interegnum after Brezhnev's death in 1982 when the party was led first by [[Yuri Andropov]] and then by [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. Unlike previous successions there was no pretence of a ''collective leadership'' replacing Brezhnev. When Brezhnev died Andropov was proclaimed General Secretary within days and by the official coverage in the Soviet media it was clear that he was ''the'' leader. Andropov died on February 9, 1984 and Chernenko was elected his replacement on February 13 but Chernenko was a compromise, stopgap candidate as Gorbachev, Andropov's protege, lacked sufficient support in the Politburo. However, Chernenko he was already an ill man and his duties were increasingly carried out by others, particularly Gorbachev who was nominated by [[Andrei Gromyko]] to become General Secretary when Chernenko died. There are indications Gorbachev may have been in control prior to Chernenko's death as he was announced as the new General Secretary the day after Chernenko died on March 10, 1985.  
-
-Gorbachev instituted policies of [[glasnost]], [[perestroika]], and acceleration. Glasnost allowed freedom of speech in the Soviet Union and a flourishing of political debate within the Communist Party to a degree not seen since the [[Russian Revolution]], perestroika was an attempt to restructure the political and particularly the economic organisation of the country, while acceleration meant faster development of the economy. This period of liberalisation ultimately ended in the dissolution of the [[Soviet bloc]] in eastern Europe.  
-
-At the Twenty-Seventh Party Congress in 1986, [[Boris Yeltsin]] became a candidate member of the Politburo and offended party members in a speech that attacked the hidden privileges of the party elite. 
-
-At the 1988 Party Conference Gorbachev launched reforms to reduce the party's control over the government including proposals for multicandidate elections to regional and local legislatures and the positions of local and regional party first secretaryships.While Gorbachev was able to receive approval for his reforms from the party, the membership of the CPSU was becoming increasingly resistant to Gorbachev's policies and rather than being a locus for change became a bulwark of conservativism. Increasingly, Gorbachev bypassed the party in order to implement his reforms relying instead on governmental bodies. 
-
-In 1990, Gorbachev obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society. 
-
-By the time of the Twenty-Eighth Party Congress in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united.

-===End of Communist rule===
+==End of Communist rule==
 The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before a ''Union Treaty'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives.  Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

 When the Bolsheviks became the ''All-Russian Communist Party'' it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
 
 By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939.  In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives.  Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
 
 After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], the party became known as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].",,Altenmann,2004-10-29T03:32:44Z,"The change made is the addition of section headers and the rephrasing of the text to include more detailed descriptions of certain historical events. Specifically, the section titles have been changed from ""Civil War"" to ""History"" with a subheading ""Civil War"", and similar changes have been made to other sections like ""Tenth Party Congress"", ""Stalin's Rise to Power"", ""Purge of the Old Bolsheviks"", ""Stalinism"", ""Post-Stalin"", ""Gorbachev"", and ""End of Communist rule"".

 ==End of Communist rule==
 The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before a ''Union Treaty'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives.  Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
 
-After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].
+After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there is widespread flora of parties in Russia, claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (due to its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Communist Party of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]].
+
+In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].
+
+In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].
+
+In [[Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in [[1992]]. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
+
+In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
+
+In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU branch converted into the [[Lithuanian Democratic Lavour Party]]. In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned. Communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

 In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU branch converted into the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]]. In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned. A major part of the party there had broken away in [[1990]] and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

 After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there is widespread flora of parties in Russia, claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU.

+===Membership===
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege with Communist Party members becoming an elite, or [[nomenklatura]], in Soviet society. Members of the nomenklatura would enjoy special privileges such as shopping at well-stocked stores, have preference in obtaining housing and access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities and obtain prestigious jobs for them. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.
+
+When the Bolsheviks became the ''All-Russian Communist Party'' it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+
+By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939.  In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

-
-==Structure==
-===CPSU===
-The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the CPSU|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
-
-In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress, however, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary. 
-
-At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or '''partkoms''' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected '''partkom secretary''' (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, [[kolkhoz]]es, etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: '''raikoms''' (райком) at [[raion]] level, '''obkoms''' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as '''gubkoms''' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), '''gorkom''' (горком) it city level, etc.
-
-The bottom level of the Party was the '''primary party organization''' (первичная партийная организация) or '''party cell''' (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called '''party bureau''' (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected '''bureau secretary''' (секретарь партбюро).
-
-At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an '''exempt secretary''' (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
-
-===Membership===
-Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with Communist Party members becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Party members enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
-
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.
-
-When the Bolsheviks became the ''All-Russian Communist Party'' it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.

-
-<!-- a summary is in order -->
-
-==End of Communist rule==
-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before a ''Union Treaty'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
-
-After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there is widespread flora of parties in Russia, claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (due to its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
-
-In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]].
-
-In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].
-
-In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].
-
-In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in [[1992]]. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
-
-In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
-
-In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. Branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] converted into the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], established in 1992. In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in [[1990]] and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

+In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress, however, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary. 
+
+At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or '''partkoms''' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected '''partkom secretary''' (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, [[kolkhoz]]es, etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: '''raikoms''' (райком) at [[raion]] level, '''obkoms''' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as '''gubkoms''' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), '''gorkom''' (горком) it city level, etc.
+
+The bottom level of the Party was the '''primary party organization''' (первичная партийная организация) or '''party cell''' (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called '''party bureau''' (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected '''bureau secretary''' (секретарь партбюро).
+
+At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an '''exempt secretary''' (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
+
+===Membership===
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with Communist Party members becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Party members enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open.

+
+When the Bolsheviks became the ''All-Russian Communist Party'' it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+
+By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

+
+==End of Communist rule==
+The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before a ''Union Treaty'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
+
+After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there is widespread flora of parties in Russia, claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (due to its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]].
+
+In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].
+
+In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].
+
+In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in [[1992]]. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
+
+In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
+
+In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. Branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] converted into the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], established in 1992. In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in [[1990]] and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

-The '''Communist Party of the [[Soviet Union]]''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия Сове́тского Сою́за'' = ''КПСС'') was the name used by the successors of the [[Bolshevik]] [[political faction|faction]] of the [[Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party]] from [[1952]] to [[1991]], but the wording '''Communist Party''' was present in the party's name since [[1918]] when the Bolsheviks became the '''Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)''' ('''RCP(b)'''). In 1925 the party became the ''All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'' (Всесоюзная коммунистическая партия (большевиков), '''ВКП(б)'''); both '''VKP(b)''' and '''AUCP(b)''' abbreviations are in use. Finally in 1952 it became simply the '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' or '''CPSU'''. This article follows the course of the party from 1918 until its dissolution in 1991. ''For information on the pre-1918 party see [[Bolshevik]]. ''
-
-Once the ''Third International'' or [[Comintern]] was formed in 1919, the [[democratic centralism|democratic centralist]] [[Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] structure of the CPSU was copied by the other Comintern members resulting in [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] being formed around the world.
-
-For most of the history of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was virtually indistinguishable from the government, as it was the only political party tolerated by the government and its security forces. Consequently, the history of the USSR and the CPSU are deeply intertwined and overlapping. Therefore, it is useful for those interested in the history of the CPSU to also consult the [[History of Russia]] series of articles.
-
-==Structure==
-===CPSU===
-The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966.

At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: '''raikoms''' (райком) at [[raion]] level, '''obkoms''' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as '''gubkoms''' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), '''gorkom''' (горком) it city level, etc.

-The bottom level of the Party was the '''primary party organization''' (первичная партийная организация) or '''party cell''' (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called '''party bureau''' (партийное бюро, партбюро).

-Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with Communist Party members becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Party members enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children.

The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

+The '''Communist Party of the [[Soviet Union]]''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия Сове́тского Сою́за'' = ''КПСС'') was the name used by the successors of the [[Bolshevik]] [[political faction|faction]] of the [[Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party]] from [[1952]] to [[1991]], but the wording '''Communist Party''' was present in the party's name since [[1918]] when the Bolsheviks became the '''Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)''' ('''RCP(b)'''). In 1925 the party became the ''All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'' (Всесоюзная коммунистическая партия (большевиков), '''ВКП(б)'''); both '''VKP(b)''' and '''AUCP(b)''' abbreviations are in use. Finally in 1952 it became simply the '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' or '''CPSU'''. This article follows the course of the party from 1918 until its dissolution in 1991. ''For information on the pre-1918 party see [[Bolshevik]]. ''
+
+Once the ''Third International'' or [[Comintern]] was formed in 1919, the [[democratic centralism|democratic centralist]] [[Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] structure of the CPSU was copied by the other Comintern members resulting in [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] being formed around the world.
+
+For most of the history of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was virtually indistinguishable from the government, as it was the only political party tolerated by the government and its security forces. Consequently, the history of the USSR and the CPSU are deeply intertwined and overlapping. Therefore, it is useful for those interested in the history of the CPSU to also consult the [[History of Russia]] series of articles.
+
+==Structure==
+===CPSU===
+The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
+
+In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress, however, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary. 
+
+At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or '''partkoms''' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected '''partkom secretary''' (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, [[kolkhoz]]es, etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: '''raikoms''' (райком) at [[raion]] level, '''obkoms''' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as '''gubkoms''' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), '''gorkom''' (горком) it city level, etc.
+
+The bottom level of the Party was the '''primary party organization''' (первичная партийная организация) or '''party cell''' (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called '''party bureau''' (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected '''bureau secretary''' (секретарь партбюро).
+
+At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an '''exempt secretary''' (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
+
+===Membership===
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with Communist Party members becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Party members enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
+
+When the Bolsheviks became the ''All-Russian Communist Party'' it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+
+By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.
+
+== History ==
+''Main article: [[History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]''
+
+With some exceptions, the course of the CPSU (and the history of the whole Soviet Union) was largely determined by its leader. The history of the CPSU since the death of [[Lenin]] can thus be divided into the eras of [[Stalin]], [[Khrushchev]], [[Brezhnev]] and [[Gorbachev]]. 
+
+<!-- a summary is in order -->
+
+==End of Communist rule==
+The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before a ''Union Treaty'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
+
+After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there is widespread flora of parties in Russia, claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (due to its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]].
+
+In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].
+
+In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].
+
+In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in [[1992]]. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
+
+In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
+
+In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. Branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] converted into the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], established in 1992. In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in [[1990]] and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

 ===Membership===
 Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with Communist Party members becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Party members enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
 
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).

**Analysis:** The removal of this section could be seen as an attempt to downplay or erase the complexities and implications of party membership in the Soviet context. This could potentially serve a narrative that simplifies or sanitizes the historical understanding of the Communist Party's role in Soviet society, which may align with certain ideological perspectives that seek to reinterpret or diminish the negative aspects of that era.

 ==End of Communist rule==
-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before a ''Union Treaty'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before a ''Union Treaty'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

+==In Estonia==
+Like in the rest of the Russian empire, the RSDLP branches in the [[Estland gubernia]] had been ravaged by division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In 1912 the Bolsheviks started a publication, ''Kiir'', in [[Narva]]. In June 1914 the party took a decision to create a special Central Committee of RSDLP(b) of Estland, named the ''Northern-Baltic Committee of the RSDLP(b)"" ({{lang-et|VSDT(b)P Põhja-Balti Komitee}}).
+
+After the [[February Revolution]], as in the rest of the empire, Bolsheviks started to gain popularity with their demands to end the war immediately, as well as their support for fast land reform and originally even ethnic claims (to introduce estonian as an official language parallel to russian). During the summer of 1917 Bolsheviks and their supporters took the control over the Tallinn Soviet.
+
+By the  end of 1917 Estonian Bolsheviks were stronger than ever - holding control over political power and having significant support - remarkably more than in Russia. In the elections into the Russian Constituent Assembly their list got 40,2% of the votes in Estonia and 4 out of 8 seats allocated to Estonia. The support for the party did however start to decline, and the Estonian Constituent Assembly election of January 1918 was never completed. Moreover the party faced the situation in which it had difficultly building alliances. Their opponents, the Democratic Bloc, was able to initiate cooperation with the Labour Party, Mensheviks and the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]]. Those parties supported different ideas but were united around the demand for an independent or Finland-linked Estonia and wished to distribute land to the peasants. In the first question the Estonian Bolsheviks, although hjaving introduced [[Estonian language|Estonian]] as an official language after their takeover, promoted the idea of Estonia as a part of Soviet Russia. In the land reform policy, estonian Bolsheviks continued to support immediate collectivisation.
+
+Bolshevik rule in Estonia was ended by the German invasion in the end of February 1918. The party branch continued to function in exile in Russia.
+
+After the German revolution in November, when an Estonian government took office, the party together with support of Soviet troops attempted an armed attack against the new state. However, by this time the support for the party had waned, and it failed to mobilize mass support for revolutionary warfare. An [[Estonian Workers Commune]] was setup, but with limited real influence. At this time the party branch had been reorganized into the ''Central Committee of the Estonian Sections of the RCP(b)'' ({{lang-et|Venemaa Kommunistliku (bolshevike) Partei Eesti Sektsioonide Keskkomitee}}). After the war a reorientation was found to be necessary (since Estonia was now an independent state) by the central leadership of the RCP(b) and thus on the [[November 5]], [[1920]] the [[Communist Party of Estonia]] was founded as a separate party.

+==== July Days ====
 In early July, widespread discontent in St. Petersburg led to militant demonstrations calling for the overthrow of the Provisional Government. The Bolshevik leadership initially opposed this as premature, but ended up leading the demonstrations, hoping to prevent any bloodshed. They felt compelled to do this to win the trust of the workers, and also in recognition of the fact that many of the Bolshevik rank and file were already organising and supporting the demonstrations. Troops loyal to the Provisional Government violently suppressed the demonstrations. The ensuing crackdown resulted in the Kerensky government ordering the arrest of the Bolshevik leadership on [[July 19]]. Lenin escaped capture, went into hiding, and wrote ''[[State and Revolution]]'', which outlined his ideas for a socialist government.
 
 The repression against the Bolsheviks ceased when the Kerensky government was threatened by a [[Kornilov Affair|rebellion]] led by [[Lavr Georgevich Kornilov|General Kornilov]], and offered arms to those who would defend St. Petersburg against Kornilov. The Bolsheviks enlisted a 25,000 strong [[militia]] to defend St. Petersburg from attack, and reached out to Kornilov's troops, urging them not to attack. The troops stood down and the rebellion fizzled. Kornilov was taken into custody. However, the Bolsheviks did not return their arms, and Kerensky succeeded only in strengthening the Bolshevik position.
 
 During this period, a situation of [[dual power]] developed. While the legislature and provisional government were controlled by Kerensky in coalition with the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionary Party, the workers' and soldiers' soviets were increasingly under the control of the Bolsheviks, who now had what amounted to their own private army.

 [[Image:Ska 018.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bukharin, Zinoviev, Kamenev]]The Bolshevik [[Central Committee of the CPSU|Central Committee]] spent September and October of 1917 debating whether they should use parliamentary methods or whether they should seize power by force. With Lenin in hiding in [[Finland]], the parliamentary line — advocated by [[Kamenev]], [[Zinoviev]] and [[Rykov]] against [[Trotsky]] — at first prevailed. The Bolsheviks participated in the quasiparliamentary bodies convened by the Provisional Government, the [[Democratic Conference]] and the smaller, more permanent [[Pre-Parliament]].
 
 Lenin sent numerous letters to the Central Committee and to St. Petersburg party activists urging them to abandon the parliamentary path and overthrow the Provisional Government by means of an [[insurrection]]. The balance of power within the Central Committee shifted in favor of the insurrection in early October, resulting in the Bolshevik delegation withdrawing from the Pre-Parliament on [[October 7]] [[1917]] (Old Style).<ref>See the excerpts from the Central Committee meeting minutes in V.

+In early July, widespread discontent in St. Petersburg led to militant demonstrations calling for the overthrow of the Provisional Government. The Bolshevik leadership initially opposed this as premature, but ended up leading the demonstrations, hoping to prevent any bloodshed. They felt compelled to do this to win the trust of the workers, and also in recognition of the fact that many of the Bolshevik rank and file were already organising and supporting the demonstrations. Troops loyal to the Provisional Government violently suppressed the demonstrations. The ensuing crackdown resulted in the Kerensky government ordering the arrest of the Bolshevik leadership on [[July 19]]. Lenin escaped capture, went into hiding, and wrote ''[[State and Revolution]]'', which outlined his ideas for a socialist government.
+
+The repression against the Bolsheviks ceased when the Kerensky government was threatened by a [[Kornilov Affair|rebellion]] led by [[Lavr Georgevich Kornilov|General Kornilov]], and offered arms to those who would defend St. Petersburg against Kornilov. The Bolsheviks enlisted a 25,000 strong [[militia]] to defend St. Petersburg from attack, and reached out to Kornilov's troops, urging them not to attack. The troops stood down and the rebellion fizzled. Kornilov was taken into custody. However, the Bolsheviks did not return their arms, and Kerensky succeeded only in strengthening the Bolshevik position.
+
+During this period, a situation of [[dual power]] developed. While the legislature and provisional government were controlled by Kerensky in coalition with the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionary Party, the workers' and soldiers' soviets were increasingly under the control of the Bolsheviks, who now had what amounted to their own private army.

The Bolsheviks participated in the quasiparliamentary bodies convened by the Provisional Government, the [[Democratic Conference]] and the smaller, more permanent [[Pre-Parliament]].
+
+Lenin sent numerous letters to the Central Committee and to St. Petersburg party activists urging them to abandon the parliamentary path and overthrow the Provisional Government by means of an [[insurrection]]. The balance of power within the Central Committee shifted in favor of the insurrection in early October, resulting in the Bolshevik delegation withdrawing from the Pre-Parliament on [[October 7]] [[1917]] (Old Style).<ref>See the excerpts from the Central Committee meeting minutes in V. I. Lenin. ''Toward the Seizure of Power: Part One'', International Publishers, 1932 (Kessinger Publishing reprint) ISBN 1-4191-6291-8 p.302</ref>
+
+On [[October 10]], the Bolshevik Central Committee decided in favor of an uprising, with only [[Zinoviev]] and [[Kamenev]] voting against it. The latter took the unusual step of making their objections public, which infuriated Lenin, who demanded their [http://www.marx2mao.com/Lenin/LPM17.html expulsion from the party] for breaching [[party discipline]]. The Central Committee also established a smaller [[Politburo]] to prepare for the uprising, although it's not clear whether it was ever functional (Trotsky later claimed that it never met.) This Politburo was dissolved on [[October 25]], [[1917]], once the Bolsheviks had taken power in the [[October Revolution]]. A permanent Politburo was not established until March 1919, during the [[Russian Civil War]], when decisions had to be made quickly and many Central Committee members were away from the new capital, [[Moscow]].
+
+When Kerensky moved against the Bolsheviks on [[October 22]] by ordering the arrest of their [[Military Revolutionary Committee]], banning the Bolshevik newspaper, and cutting off telephone lines to the Bolshevik headquarters in the [[Smolny Institute]], Trotsky urged that the Bolsheviks' decision to overthrow the government be put into action. Lenin concurred, and on [[October 24]], orders were issued for the Bolsheviks' [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] to occupy key locations in the city and surround the [[Winter Palace]] where the Provisional government had its headquarters. The uprising was a success, and Bolshevik-led forces were in control of the capital by [[October 26]].

Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
 
 In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress, however, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary.

-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before a ''Union Treaty'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

 After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there is a widespread flora of parties in Russia, claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (due to its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.

-By the  end of 1917 Estonian Bolsheviks were stronger than ever - holding control over political power and having significant support - remarkably more than in Russia. In the elections into the Russian Constituent Assembly their list got 40,2% of the votes in Estonia and 4 out of 8 seats allocated to Estonia. The support for the party did however start to decline, and the Estonian Constituent Assembly election of January 1918 was never completed. Moreover the party faced the situation in which it had difficultly building alliances. Their opponents, the Democratic Bloc, was able to initiate cooperation with the Labour Party, Mensheviks and the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]]. Those parties supported different ideas but were united around the demand for an independent or Finland-linked Estonia and wished to distribute land to the peasants. In the first question the Estonian Bolsheviks, although hjaving introduced [[Estonian language|Estonian]] as an official language after their takeover, promoted the idea of Estonia as a part of Soviet Russia. In the land reform policy, estonian Bolsheviks continued to support immediate collectivisation.

 Bolshevik rule in Estonia was ended by the German invasion in the end of February 1918. The party branch continued to function in exile in Russia.

 For dicks of the history of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was virtually indistinguishable from the government, as it was generally the only political party tolerated by the government. Consequently, the history of the USSR and the CPSU are deeply intertwined and overlapping. Therefore, it is useful for those interested in the history of the CPSU to also consult the [[History of Russia]] series of articles.

 {{main|Communist Party of Estonia}}
 Like in the rest of the Russian empire, the RSDLP branches in the [[Estland gubernia]] had been ravaged by division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In 1912 the Bolsheviks started a publication, ''Kiir'', in [[Narva]]. In June 1914 the party took a decision to create a special Central Committee of RSDLP(b) of Estland, named the ''Northern-Baltic Committee of the RSDLP(b)"" ({{lang-et|VSDT(b)P Põhja-Balti Komitee}}).
 
-After the [[February Revolution]], as in the rest of the empire, Bolsheviks started to gain popularity with their demands to end the war immediately, as well as their support for fast land reform and originally even ethnic claims (to introduce estonian as an official language parallel to russian). During the summer of 1917 Bolsheviks and their supporters took the control over the Tallinn Soviet.
-
-By the  end of 1917 Estonian Bolsheviks were stronger than ever - holding control over political power and having significant support - remarkably more than in Russia. In the elections into the Russian Constituent Assembly their list got 40,2% of the votes in Estonia and 4 out of 8 seats allocated to Estonia. The support for the party did however start to decline, and the Estonian Constituent Assembly election of January 1918 was never completed. Moreover the party faced the situation in which it had difficultly building alliances. Their opponents, the Democratic Bloc, was able to initiate cooperation with the Labour Party, Mensheviks and the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]]. Those parties supported different ideas but were united around the demand for an independent or Finland-linked Estonia and wished to distribute land to the peasants. In the first question the Estonian Bolsheviks, although having introduced [[Estonian language|Estonian]] as an official language after their takeover, promoted the idea of Estonia as a part of Soviet Russia. In the land reform policy, estonian Bolsheviks continued to support immediate collectivisation.

-The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия Сове́тского Сою́за'' = ''КПСС'') was the ruling party in the [[Soviet Union]].

The party led the [[October Revolution]], which led to the establishment of a socialist state in Russia. The party was dissolved in 1991, at the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union.

-
-==Structure==
-===CPSU===
-{{main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
-The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
-
-In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress, however, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary. 
-
-{{Communism}}
-
-At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or '''partkoms''' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected '''partkom secretary''' (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, [[kolkhoz]]es, etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: '''raikoms''' (райком) at [[raion]] level, '''obkoms''' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as '''gubkoms''' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), '''gorkom''' (горком) it city level, etc.
-
-The bottom level of the Party was the '''primary party organization''' (первичная партийная организация) or '''party cell''' (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called '''party bureau''' (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected '''bureau secretary''' (секретарь партбюро).
-
-At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an '''exempt secretary''' (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
-
-===Membership===
-Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
-
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
-
-In [[1918]] it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
-
-By [[1933]], the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by [[1939]]. In [[1986]], the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

-===End of Communist rule===
-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
-
-After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there is a widespread flora of parties in Russia, claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (due to its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
-
-In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (SKP-KPSS).
-
-* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].
-* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islom Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].
-* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in [[1992]]. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
-* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
-* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
-* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in [[1990]] and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

-{{main|Communist Party of Estonia}}
-Like in the rest of the Russian empire, the RSDLP branches in the [[Estland gubernia]] had been ravaged by division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In 1912 the Bolsheviks started a publication, ''Kiir'', in [[Narva]]. In June 1914 the party took a decision to create a special Central Committee of RSDLP(b) of Estland, named the ''Northern-Baltic Committee of the RSDLP(b)"" ({{lang-et|VSDT(b)P Põhja-Balti Komitee}}).
-
-After the [[February Revolution]], as in the rest of the empire, Bolsheviks started to gain popularity with their demands to end the war immediately, as well as their support for fast land reform and originally even ethnic claims (to introduce Estonian as an official language parallel to Russian). During the summer of 1917 Bolsheviks and their supporters took the control over the Tallinn Soviet.
-
-By the  end of 1917 Estonian Bolsheviks were stronger than ever - holding control over political power and having significant support - remarkably more than in Russia. In the elections into the Russian Constituent Assembly their list got 40,2% of the votes in Estonia and 4 out of 8 seats allocated to Estonia. The support for the party did however start to decline, and the Estonian Constituent Assembly election of January 1918 was never completed. Moreover the party faced the situation in which it had difficultly building alliances. Their opponents, the Democratic Bloc, was able to initiate cooperation with the Labour Party, Mensheviks and the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]]. Those parties supported different ideas but were united around the demand for an independent or Finland-linked Estonia and wished to distribute land to the peasants. In the first question the Estonian Bolsheviks, although having introduced [[Estonian language|Estonian]] as an official language after their takeover, promoted the idea of Estonia as a part of Soviet Russia. In the land reform policy, Estonian Bolsheviks continued to support immediate collectivisation.
-
-Bolshevik rule in Estonia was ended by the German invasion in the end of February 1918. The party branch continued to function in exile in Russia.
-
-After the German revolution in November, when an Estonian government took office, the party together with support of Soviet troops attempted an armed attack against the new state. However, by this time the support for the party had waned, and it failed to mobilize mass support for revolutionary warfare. An [[Estonian Workers Commune]] was setup, but with limited real influence. At this time the party branch had been reorganized into the ''Central Committee of the Estonian Sections of the RCP(b)'' ({{lang-et|Venemaa Kommunistliku (bolshevike) Partei Eesti Sektsioonide Keskkomitee}}). After the war a reorientation was found to be necessary (since Estonia was now an independent state) by the central leadership of the RCP(b) and thus on the [[November 5]], [[1920]] the [[Communist Party of Estonia]] (EKP) was founded as a separate party.
-
-In 1940 EKP was merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of CPSU(b) in the [[Estonian SSR]] became known as Communist Party of Estonia (bolshevik) (EK(b)P).
-
-The EK(b)P was purged in [[1950]] of many of its original native leaders; they were replaced by several prominent Russian Estonians who had grown up in Russia. 
-
-When the CPSU(b) changed its name in 1952, the EK(b)P removed the (b) from its name.
-
-EKP was divided in [[1990]], as the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners broke away forming a party called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)).
-
-==In Lithuania==
-By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of the party in Lithuania was called Communist Party of Lithuania (bolshevik) (LK(b)P).
-
-In the Lithuanian territorial organization, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the party (always a Lithuanian) was de facto governor of the country. The second secretary was always a Moscow-appointed Russian.
-
-In 1952 the name of the old Lithuanian party, LKP, was retaken.
-
-In 1989, during [[History of Lithuania#Rebirth|mass protests against Soviet Union in Lithuania]] the party declared itself independent from Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
-
-An alternative Communist Party of Lithuania ('on platform of Communist Party of the Soviet Union') existed in 1990-1991 under leadership of [[Mykolas Burokevičius]]. It was established after the ""traditional"" party declared its independence from its Soviet Union counterpart, and was eventually banned in 1991.
-
-In 1990 the Communist Party of Lithuania was renamed into [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], which in turn was later merged with [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania]] under the later's name, but with leadership dominated by ex-communists.
-
-==In Moldova==
-{{main|Communist Party of Moldova}}
-The Communist Party of Moldova ({{lang-ro|Partidul Comunist al Moldovei}}, PCM) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Moldavian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic.

Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia.

+
+==Structure==
+===CPSU===
+{{main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
+The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
+
+In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress, however, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary. 
+
+{{Communism}}
+
+At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or '''partkoms''' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected '''partkom secretary''' (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, [[kolkhoz]]es, etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: '''raikoms''' (райком) at [[raion]] level, '''obkoms''' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as '''gubkoms''' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), '''gorkom''' (горком) it city level, etc.
+
+The bottom level of the Party was the '''primary party organization''' (первичная партийная организация) or '''party cell''' (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called '''party bureau''' (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected '''bureau secretary''' (секретарь партбюро).
+
+At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an '''exempt secretary''' (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
+
+===Membership===
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
+
+In [[1918]] it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+

However, CPRF is generally seen (due to its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (SKP-KPSS).
+
+* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].
+* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islom Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].
+* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in [[1992]]. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
+* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
+* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
+* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in [[1990]] and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].
+
+==In Estonia==
+{{Mergeto|Communist Party of Estonia|date=March 2007}}
+{{main|Communist Party of Estonia}}
+Like in the rest of the Russian empire, the RSDLP branches in the [[Estland gubernia]] had been ravaged by division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In 1912 the Bolsheviks started a publication, ''Kiir'', in [[Narva]]. In June 1914 the party took a decision to create a special Central Committee of RSDLP(b) of Estland, named the ''Northern-Baltic Committee of the RSDLP(b)"" ({{lang-et|VSDT(b)P Põhja-Balti Komitee}}).
+
+After the [[February Revolution]], as in the rest of the empire, Bolsheviks started to gain popularity with their demands to end the war immediately, as well as their support for fast land reform and originally even ethnic claims (to introduce Estonian as an official language parallel to Russian). During the summer of 1917 Bolsheviks and their supporters took the control over the Tallinn Soviet.
+
+By the  end of 1917 Estonian Bolsheviks were stronger than ever - holding control over political power and having significant support - remarkably more than in Russia. In the elections into the Russian Constituent Assembly their list got 40,2% of the votes in Estonia and 4 out of 8 seats allocated to Estonia. The support for the party did however start to decline, and the Estonian Constituent Assembly election of January 1918 was never completed. Moreover the party faced the situation in which it had difficultly building alliances. Their opponents, the Democratic Bloc, was able to initiate cooperation with the Labour Party, Mensheviks and the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]]. Those parties supported different ideas but were united around the demand for an independent or Finland-linked Estonia and wished to distribute land to the peasants. In the first question the Estonian Bolsheviks, although having introduced [[Estonian language|Estonian]] as an official language after their takeover, promoted the idea of Estonia as a part of Soviet Russia. In the land reform policy, Estonian Bolsheviks continued to support immediate collectivisation.

+Bolshevik rule in Estonia was ended by the German invasion in the end of February 1918. The party branch continued to function in exile in Russia.
+
+After the German revolution in November, when an Estonian government took office, the party together with support of Soviet troops attempted an armed attack against the new state. However, by this time the support for the party had waned, and it failed to mobilize mass support for revolutionary warfare. An [[Estonian Workers Commune]] was setup, but with limited real influence. At this time the party branch had been reorganized into the ''Central Committee of the Estonian Sections of the RCP(b)'' ({{lang-et|Venemaa Kommunistliku (bolshevike) Partei Eesti Sektsioonide Keskkomitee}}). After the war a reorientation was found to be necessary (since Estonia was now an independent state) by the central leadership of the RCP(b) and thus on the [[November 5]], [[1920]] the [[Communist Party of Estonia]] (EKP) was founded as a separate party.
+
+In 1940 EKP was merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of CPSU(b) in the [[Estonian SSR]] became known as Communist Party of Estonia (bolshevik) (EK(b)P).
+
+The EK(b)P was purged in [[1950]] of many of its original native leaders; they were replaced by several prominent Russian Estonians who had grown up in Russia. 
+
+When the CPSU(b) changed its name in 1952, the EK(b)P removed the (b) from its name.
+
+EKP was divided in [[1990]], as the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners broke away forming a party called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)).
+
+==In Lithuania==
+By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of the party in Lithuania was called Communist Party of Lithuania (bolshevik) (LK(b)P).
+
+In the Lithuanian territorial organization, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the party (always a Lithuanian) was de facto governor of the country. The second secretary was always a Moscow-appointed Russian.
+
+In 1952 the name of the old Lithuanian party, LKP, was retaken.
+
+In 1989, during [[History of Lithuania#Rebirth|mass protests against Soviet Union in Lithuania]] the party declared itself independent from Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
+
+An alternative Communist Party of Lithuania ('on platform of Communist Party of the Soviet Union') existed in 1990-1991 under leadership of [[Mykolas Burokevičius]]. It was established after the ""traditional"" party declared its independence from its Soviet Union counterpart, and was eventually banned in 1991.
+
+In 1990 the Communist Party of Lithuania was renamed into [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], which in turn was later merged with [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania]] under the later's name, but with leadership dominated by ex-communists.
+
+==In Moldova==
+{{main|Communist Party of Moldova}}
+The Communist Party of Moldova ({{lang-ro|Partidul Comunist al Moldovei}}, PCM) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Moldavian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic. It was outlawed by the pro-Romanian Popular Front government in August 1991, just after Moldova declared independence.
+
+After the Communist party was legalised again by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova on 7 September 1993, the PCM was reborn as the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], which has governed Moldova since 2001.

 ===Membership===
 Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children.

 Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
 
 In [[1918]] it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
 
 By [[1933]], the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by [[1939]]. In [[1986]], the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

-The growing likelihood of the sex with the USSR itself, without protection, led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
 
 In [[1918]] it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
 
 By [[1933]], the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by [[1939]]. In [[1986]], the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

 After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there is a widespread flora of parties in Russia, claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (due to its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.

 For most of the history of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was virtually indistinguishable from the government, as it was generally the only political party tolerated by the government. Consequently, the history of the USSR and the CPSU are deeply intertwined and overlapping. Therefore, it is useful for those interested in the history of the CPSU to also consult the [[History of Russia]] series of articles.

 The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия Сове́тского Сою́за'' = ''КПСС'') was the ruling party in the [[Soviet Union]]. It emerged in 1912 as the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party]] created a separate party. The party led the [[October Revolution]], which led to the establishment of a socialist state in Russia. The party was dissolved in 1991, at the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union.

+For most of the history of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was virtually indistinguishable from the government, as it was generally the only political party tolerated by the government.

 {{main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
 The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
 
 In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress, however, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary. 
-

 At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or '''partkoms''' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected '''partkom secretary''' (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, [[kolkhoz]]es, etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: '''raikoms''' (райком) at [[raion]] level, '''obkoms''' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as '''gubkoms''' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), '''gorkom''' (горком) it city level, etc.

 Like in the rest of the Russian empire, the RSDLP branches in the [[Estland gubernia]] had been ravaged by division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In 1912 the Bolsheviks started a publication, ''Kiir'', in [[Narva]]. In June 1914 the party took a decision to create a special Central Committee of RSDLP(b) of Estland, named the ''Northern-Baltic Committee of the RSDLP(b)"" ({{lang-et|VSDT(b)P Põhja-Balti Komitee}}).

During the summer of bilfred bowers 1917 Bolsheviks and their supporters took the control over the Tallinn Soviet.

During the summer of 1917 Bolsheviks and their supporters took the control over the Tallinn Soviet.
 
 By the  end of 1917 Estonian Bolsheviks were stronger than ever - holding control over political power and having significant support - remarkably more than in Russia. In the elections into the Russian Constituent Assembly their list got 40,2% of the votes in Estonia and 4 out of 8 seats allocated to Estonia. The support for the party did however start to decline, and the Estonian Constituent Assembly election of January 1918 was never completed.

-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved due to large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

-After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].

 By [[1933]], the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by [[1939]]. In [[1986]], the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

-
-The bottom level of the Party was the '''primary party organization''' (первичная партийная организация) or '''party cell''' (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called '''party bureau''' (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected '''bureau secretary''' (секретарь партбюро).
-
-At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an '''exempt secretary''' (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
-
-===Membership===
-Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
-
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
-
-In [[1918]] it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
-
-By [[1933]], the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by [[1939]]. In [[1986]], the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
-
-Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
-
-After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there is a widespread flora of parties in Russia, claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
-
-In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (SKP-KPSS).
-
-* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].
-* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islom Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].
-* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in [[1992]]. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
-* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
-* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
-* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in [[1990]] and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

-==In Estonia==
-{{Mergeto|Communist Party of Estonia|date=March 2007}}
-{{main|Communist Party of Estonia}}
-Like in the rest of the Russian empire, the RSDLP branches in the [[Estland gubernia]] had been ravaged by division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In 1912 the Bolsheviks started a publication, ''Kiir'', in [[Narva]]. In June 1914 the party took a decision to create a special Central Committee of RSDLP(b) of Estland, named the ''Northern-Baltic Committee of the RSDLP(b)"" ({{lang-et|VSDT(b)P Põhja-Balti Komitee}}).
-
-After the [[February Revolution]], as in the rest of the empire, Bolsheviks started to gain popularity with their demands to end the war immediately, as well as their support for fast land reform and originally even ethnic claims (to introduce Estonian as an official language parallel to Russian). During the summer of 1917 Bolsheviks and their supporters took the control over the Tallinn Soviet.
-
-By the  end of 1917 Estonian Bolsheviks were stronger than ever - holding control over political power and having significant support - remarkably more than in Russia. In the elections into the Russian Constituent Assembly their list got 40,2% of the votes in Estonia and 4 out of 8 seats allocated to Estonia. The support for the party did however start to decline, and the Estonian Constituent Assembly election of January 1918 was never completed. Moreover the party faced the situation in which it had difficultly building alliances. Their opponents, the Democratic Bloc, was able to initiate cooperation with the Labour Party, Mensheviks and the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]]. Those parties supported different ideas but were united around the demand for an independent or Finland-linked Estonia and wished to distribute land to the peasants. In the first question the Estonian Bolsheviks, although having introduced [[Estonian language|Estonian]] as an official language after their takeover, promoted the idea of Estonia as a part of Soviet Russia. In the land reform policy, Estonian Bolsheviks continued to support immediate collectivisation.
-
-Bolshevik rule in Estonia was ended by the German invasion in the end of February 1918. The party branch continued to function in exile in Russia.
-
-After the German revolution in November, when an Estonian government took office, the party together with support of Soviet troops attempted an armed attack against the new state. However, by this time the support for the party had waned, and it failed to mobilize mass support for revolutionary warfare. An [[Estonian Workers Commune]] was setup, but with limited real influence. At this time the party branch had been reorganized into the ''Central Committee of the Estonian Sections of the RCP(b)'' ({{lang-et|Venemaa Kommunistliku (bolshevike) Partei Eesti Sektsioonide Keskkomitee}}). After the war a reorientation was found to be necessary (since Estonia was now an independent state) by the central leadership of the RCP(b) and thus on the [[November 5]], [[1920]] the [[Communist Party of Estonia]] (EKP) was founded as a separate party.
-
-In 1940 EKP was merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of CPSU(b) in the [[Estonian SSR]] became known as Communist Party of Estonia (bolshevik) (EK(b)P).
-
-The EK(b)P was purged in [[1950]] of many of its original native leaders; they were replaced by several prominent Russian Estonians who had grown up in Russia. 
-
-When the CPSU(b) changed its name in 1952, the EK(b)P removed the (b) from its name.
-
-EKP was divided in [[1990]], as the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners broke away forming a party called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)).
-
-==In Lithuania==
-By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of the party in Lithuania was called Communist Party of Lithuania (bolshevik) (LK(b)P).
-
-In the Lithuanian territorial organization, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the party (always a Lithuanian) was de facto governor of the country. The second secretary was always a Moscow-appointed Russian.
-
-In 1952 the name of the old Lithuanian party, LKP, was retaken.
-
-In 1989, during [[History of Lithuania#Rebirth|mass protests against Soviet Union in Lithuania]] the party declared itself independent from Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
-
-An alternative Communist Party of Lithuania ('on platform of Communist Party of the Soviet Union') existed in 1990-1991 under leadership of [[Mykolas Burokevičius]]. It was established after the ""traditional"" party declared its independence from its Soviet Union counterpart, and was eventually banned in 1991.
-
-In 1990 the Communist Party of Lithuania was renamed into [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], which in turn was later merged with [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania]] under the later's name, but with leadership dominated by ex-communists.
-
-==In Moldova==
-{{main|Communist Party of Moldova}}
-The Communist Party of Moldova ({{lang-ro|Partidul Comunist al Moldovei}}, PCM) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Moldavian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic. It was outlawed by the pro-Romanian Popular Front government in August 1991, just after Moldova declared independence.
-
-After the Communist party was legalised again by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova on 7 September 1993, the PCM was reborn as the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], which has governed Moldova since 2001.

+The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия Сове́тского Сою́за'', [[Romanization of Russian|transliterated]] ''Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza'', [[acronym]]: ''КПСС'' (''KPSS'')) was the ruling [[political party]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. It emerged in 1912 as the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party]] created a separate party. The party led the [[October Revolution]], which led to the establishment of a socialist state in Russia. The party was dissolved in 1991, at the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union.
+
+For most of the history of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was virtually indistinguishable from the government, as it was generally the only political party tolerated by the government. Consequently, the history of the USSR and the CPSU are deeply intertwined and overlapping. Therefore, it is useful for those interested in the history of the CPSU to also consult the [[History of Russia]] series of articles.
+
+==Structure==
+{{Communism}}
+===CPSU===
+{{main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
+The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
+
+In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress.  However, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary. 
+
+At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or '''partkoms''' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected '''partkom secretary''' (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, [[kolkhoz]]es, etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: '''raikoms''' (райком) at [[raion]] level, '''obkoms''' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as '''gubkoms''' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), '''gorkom''' (горком) it city level, etc.
+
+The bottom level of the Party was the '''primary party organization''' (первичная партийная организация) or '''party cell''' (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called '''party bureau''' (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected '''bureau secretary''' (секретарь партбюро).
+
+At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an '''exempt secretary''' (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
+
+===Membership===
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
+
+In [[1918]] it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+
+By [[1933]], the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by [[1939]]. In [[1986]], the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

+
+* The [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Росси́́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия'' , ''РСДРП'') was formed in [[Minsk]] in [[1889]]. 
+
+* The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was finally divided in 1912, although the [[Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik]] factions had ''de facto'' functioned as separate political blocs. Henceforth, the Bolshevik party was known as RSDLP (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Росси́́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия (большевико́в)'' , ''РСДРП(б)'').
+
+* In [[1918]] the party took the name Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Росси́йская Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в)'' , ''РКП(б)'').
+
+* In [[1925]] the party was renamed the [[All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)|All-Union Communist party (bolsheviks)]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Всесою́зная Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в)'' , ''ВКП(б)'').
+
+* In [[1952]] the party was renamed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
+
+===End of Communist rule===
+
+The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
+
+Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
+
+After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there is a widespread flora of parties in Russia, claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (SKP-KPSS).
+
+* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].

The support for the party did however start to decline, and the Estonian Constituent Assembly election of January 1918 was never completed. Moreover the party faced the situation in which it had difficultly building alliances. Their opponents, the Democratic Bloc, was able to initiate cooperation with the Labour Party, Mensheviks and the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]]. Those parties supported different ideas but were united around the demand for an independent or Finland-linked Estonia and wished to distribute land to the peasants. In the first question the Estonian Bolsheviks, although having introduced [[Estonian language|Estonian]] as an official language after their takeover, promoted the idea of Estonia as a part of Soviet Russia. In the land reform policy, Estonian Bolsheviks continued to support immediate collectivisation.
+
+Bolshevik rule in Estonia was ended by the German invasion in the end of February 1918. The party branch continued to function in exile in Russia.
+
+After the German revolution in November, when an Estonian government took office, the party together with support of Soviet troops attempted an armed attack against the new state. However, by this time the support for the party had waned, and it failed to mobilize mass support for revolutionary warfare. An [[Estonian Workers Commune]] was setup, but with limited real influence. At this time the party branch had been reorganized into the ''Central Committee of the Estonian Sections of the RCP(b)'' ({{lang-et|Venemaa Kommunistliku (bolshevike) Partei Eesti Sektsioonide Keskkomitee}}). After the war a reorientation was found to be necessary (since Estonia was now an independent state) by the central leadership of the RCP(b) and thus on the [[November 5]], [[1920]] the [[Communist Party of Estonia]] (EKP) was founded as a separate party.
+
+In 1940 EKP was merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of CPSU(b) in the [[Estonian SSR]] became known as Communist Party of Estonia (bolshevik) (EK(b)P).
+
+The EK(b)P was purged in [[1950]] of many of its original native leaders; they were replaced by several prominent Russian Estonians who had grown up in Russia. 
+
+When the CPSU(b) changed its name in 1952, the EK(b)P removed the (b) from its name.
+
+EKP was divided in [[1990]], as the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners broke away forming a party called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)).
+
+==In Lithuania==
+By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of the party in Lithuania was called Communist Party of Lithuania (bolshevik) (LK(b)P).
+
+In the Lithuanian territorial organization, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the party (always a Lithuanian) was de facto governor of the country. The second secretary was always a Moscow-appointed Russian.
+
+In 1952 the name of the old Lithuanian party, LKP, was retaken.
+
+In 1989, during [[History of Lithuania#Rebirth|mass protests against Soviet Union in Lithuania]] the party declared itself independent from Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
+
+An alternative Communist Party of Lithuania ('on platform of Communist Party of the Soviet Union') existed in 1990-1991 under leadership of [[Mykolas Burokevičius]]. It was established after the ""traditional"" party declared its independence from its Soviet Union counterpart, and was eventually banned in 1991.
+
+In 1990 the Communist Party of Lithuania was renamed into [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], which in turn was later merged with [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania]] under the later's name, but with leadership dominated by ex-communists.
+
+==In Moldova==
+{{main|Communist Party of Moldova}}
+The Communist Party of Moldova ({{lang-ro|Partidul Comunist al Moldovei}}, PCM) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Moldavian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic. It was outlawed by the pro-Romanian Popular Front government in August 1991, just after Moldova declared independence.
+
+After the Communist party was legalised again by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova on 7 September 1993, the PCM was reborn as the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], which has governed Moldova since 2001.

 Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).

 {{main|Communist Party of Estonia}}
 Like in the rest of the Russian empire, the RSDLP branches in the [[Estland gubernia]] had been ravaged by division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In 1912 the Bolsheviks started a publication, ''Kiir'', in [[Narva]]. In June 1914 the party took a decision to create a special Central Committee of RSDLP(b) of Estland, named the ''Northern-Baltic Committee of the RSDLP(b)"" ({{lang-et|VSDT(b)P Põhja-Balti Komitee}}).
 
 After the [[February Revolution]], as in the rest of the empire, Bolsheviks started to gain popularity with their demands to end the war immediately, as well as their support for fast land reform and originally even ethnic claims (to introduce Estonian as an official language parallel to Russian). During the summer of 1917 Bolsheviks and their supporters took the control over the Tallinn Soviet.
-
-By the  end of 1917 Estonian Bolsheviks were stronger than ever - holding control over political power and having significant support - remarkably more than in Russia. In the elections into the Russian Constituent Assembly their list got 40,2% of the votes in Estonia and 4 out of 8 seats allocated to Estonia. The support for the party did however start to decline, and the Estonian Constituent Assembly election of January 1918 was never completed. Moreover the party faced the situation in which it had difficultly building alliances. Their opponents, the Democratic Bloc, was able to initiate cooperation with the Labour Party, Mensheviks and the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]]. Those parties supported different ideas but were united around the demand for an independent or Finland-linked Estonia and wished to distribute land to the peasants. In the first question the Estonian Bolsheviks, although having introduced [[Estonian language|Estonian]] as an official language after their takeover, promoted the idea of Estonia as a part of Soviet Russia. In the land reform policy, Estonian Bolsheviks continued to support immediate collectivisation.
-
-Bolshevik rule in Estonia was ended by the German invasion in the end of February 1918. The party branch continued to function in exile in Russia.
-
-After the German revolution in November, when an Estonian government took office, the party together with support of Soviet troops attempted an armed attack against the new state. However, by this time the support for the party had waned, and it failed to mobilize mass support for revolutionary warfare. An [[Estonian Workers' Commune]] was set up, but with limited real influence. At this time the party branch had been reorganized into the ''Central Committee of the Estonian Sections of the RCP(b)'' ({{lang-et|Venemaa Kommunistliku (bolshevike) Partei Eesti Sektsioonide Keskkomitee}}). After the war a reorientation was found to be necessary (since Estonia was now an independent state) by the central leadership of the RCP(b) and thus on the [[November 5]], [[1920]] the [[Communist Party of Estonia]] (EKP) was founded as a separate party.
-
-In 1940 EKP was merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of CPSU(b) in the [[Estonian SSR]] became known as Communist Party of Estonia (bolshevik) (EK(b)P).
-
-The EK(b)P was purged in 1950 of many of its original native leaders; they were replaced by several prominent Russian Estonians who had grown up in Russia. 
-
-When the CPSU(b) changed its name in 1952, the EK(b)P removed the (b) from its name.
 
 EKP was divided in 1990, as the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners broke away forming a party called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)).

 ===End of Communist rule===
 
 The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led conservative elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in [[1991]] which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of conservatives. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

+Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
 
 After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there is a widespread flora of parties in Russia, claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.

Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]].

 Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
 
 Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).

 In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.

 ===Membership===
 Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.

 ===End of Communist rule===
 
-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline left-wing elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result.

Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]].

Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo.

+
+==Structure==
+===CPSU===
+
+{{Communism}}
+{{main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
+The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
+
+In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress.  However, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary. 
+
+At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom secretary"" (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) it city level, etc.
+
+The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
+
+At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""exempt secretary"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
+
+===Membership===
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
+
+In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+
+By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

+
+* The [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия , РСДРП) was formed in [[Minsk]] in 1889. 
+
+* The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was finally divided in 1912, although the [[Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik]] factions had ''de facto'' functioned as separate political blocs. Henceforth, the Bolshevik party was known as RSDLP (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , РСДРП(б)).
+
+* In 1918 the party took the name Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́йская Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , РКП(б)).
+
+* In 1925 the party was renamed the [[All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)|All-Union Communist party (bolsheviks)]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Всесою́зная Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , ВКП(б)).
+
+* In 1952 the party was renamed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
+
+===End of Communist rule===
+
+The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline left-wing elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

+Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
+
+After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (SKP-KPSS).
+
+* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].
+* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islom Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].
+* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
+* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
+* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
+* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].
+
+==In Estonia==
+{{main|Communist Party of Estonia}}
+Like in the rest of the Russian empire, the RSDLP branches in the [[Estland gubernia]] had been ravaged by division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In 1912 the Bolsheviks started a publication, ''Kiir'', in [[Narva]]. In June 1914 the party took a decision to create a special Central Committee of RSDLP(b) of Estland, named the ''Northern-Baltic Committee of the RSDLP(b)"" ({{lang-et|VSDT(b)P Põhja-Balti Komitee}}).
+
+After the [[February Revolution]], as in the rest of the empire, Bolsheviks started to gain popularity with their demands to end the war immediately, as well as their support for fast land reform and originally even ethnic claims (to introduce Estonian as an official language parallel to Russian). During the summer of 1917 Bolsheviks and their supporters took the control over the Tallinn Soviet.
+
+EKP was divided in 1990, as the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners broke away forming a party called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)).
+
+==In Lithuania==
+By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of the party in Lithuania was called Communist Party of Lithuania (bolshevik) (LK(b)P).
+
+In the Lithuanian territorial organization, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the party (always a Lithuanian) was de facto governor of the country. The second secretary was always a Moscow-appointed Russian.
+
+In 1952 the name of the old Lithuanian party, LKP, was retaken.
+
+In 1989, during [[History of Lithuania#Rebirth|mass protests against Soviet Union in Lithuania]] the party declared itself independent from Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
+
+An alternative Communist Party of Lithuania ('on platform of Communist Party of the Soviet Union') existed in 1990-1991 under leadership of [[Mykolas Burokevičius]]. It was established after the ""traditional"" party declared its independence from its Soviet Union counterpart, and was eventually banned in 1991.
+
+In 1990 the Communist Party of Lithuania was renamed into [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], which in turn was later merged with [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania]] under the later's name, but with leadership dominated by ex-communists.
+
+==In Moldova==
+{{main|Communist Party of Moldova}}
+The Communist Party of Moldova ({{lang-ro|Partidul Comunist al Moldovei}}, PCM) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Moldavian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic. It was outlawed by the pro-Romanian Popular Front government in August 1991, just after Moldova declared independence.
+
+After the Communist party was legalised again by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova on 7 September 1993, the PCM was reborn as the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], which has governed Moldova since 2001.

-
-==Structure==
-===CPSU===
-
-{{Communism}}
-{{main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
-The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
-
-In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress.  However, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary. 
-
-At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom secretary"" (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) it city level, etc.
-
-The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
-
-At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""exempt secretary"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
-
-===Membership===
-Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
-
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
-
-In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
-
-By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

-== History ==
-
-''Main article: [[History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]''
-
-* The [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия , РСДРП) was formed in [[Minsk]] in 1889. 
-
-* The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was finally divided in 1912, although the [[Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik]] factions had ''de facto'' functioned as separate political blocs. Henceforth, the Bolshevik party was known as RSDLP (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , РСДРП(б)).
-
-* In 1918 the party took the name Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́йская Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , РКП(б)).
-
-* In 1925 the party was renamed the [[All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)|All-Union Communist party (bolsheviks)]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Всесою́зная Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , ВКП(б)).
-
-* In 1952 the party was renamed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
-
-===End of Communist rule===
-
-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline left-wing elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
-
-Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
-
-After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
-
-In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (SKP-KPSS).
-
-* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].
-* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islom Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].
-* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
-* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
-* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
-* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

-{{main|Communist Party of Estonia}}
-Like in the rest of the Russian empire, the RSDLP branches in the [[Estland gubernia]] had been ravaged by division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In 1912 the Bolsheviks started a publication, ''Kiir'', in [[Narva]]. In June 1914 the party took a decision to create a special Central Committee of RSDLP(b) of Estland, named the ''Northern-Baltic Committee of the RSDLP(b)"" ({{lang-et|VSDT(b)P Põhja-Balti Komitee}}).

During the summer of 1917 Bolsheviks and their supporters took the control over the Tallinn Soviet.
-
-EKP was divided in 1990, as the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners broke away forming a party called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)).
-
-==In Lithuania==
-By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of the party in Lithuania was called Communist Party of Lithuania (bolshevik) (LK(b)P).
-
-In the Lithuanian territorial organization, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the party (always a Lithuanian) was de facto governor of the country. The second secretary was always a Moscow-appointed Russian.

-In 1952 the name of the old Lithuanian party, LKP, was retaken.
-
-In 1989, during [[History of Lithuania#Rebirth|mass protests against Soviet Union in Lithuania]] the party declared itself independent from Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
-
-An alternative Communist Party of Lithuania ('on platform of Communist Party of the Soviet Union') existed in 1990-1991 under leadership of [[Mykolas Burokevičius]]. It was established after the ""traditional"" party declared its independence from its Soviet Union counterpart, and was eventually banned in 1991.
-
-In 1990 the Communist Party of Lithuania was renamed into [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], which in turn was later merged with [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania]] under the later's name, but with leadership dominated by ex-communists.

-==In Moldova==
-{{main|Communist Party of Moldova}}
-The Communist Party of Moldova ({{lang-ro|Partidul Comunist al Moldovei}}, PCM) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Moldavian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic. It was outlawed by the pro-Romanian Popular Front government in August 1991, just after Moldova declared independence.
-
-After the Communist party was legalised again by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova on 7 September 1993, the PCM was reborn as the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], which has governed Moldova since 2001.

 The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка).

 ===Membership===
 Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.",/* CPSU */,Altenmann,2008-04-24T02:17:26Z,"**Change Description:** Replaced ""exempt secretary"" with ""[[exempt secretary]]"" to create a link in the text.

-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline left-wing elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
-
-Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
-
-After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
-
-In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (SKP-KPSS).

-==In Estonia==
-{{main|Communist Party of Estonia}}
-Like in the rest of the Russian empire, the RSDLP branches in the [[Estland gubernia]] had been ravaged by division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In 1912 the Bolsheviks started a publication, ''Kiir'', in [[Narva]]. In June 1914 the party took a decision to create a special Central Committee of RSDLP(b) of Estland, named the ''Northern-Baltic Committee of the RSDLP(b)"" ({{lang-et|VSDT(b)P Põhja-Balti Komitee}}).
-
-After the [[February Revolution]], as in the rest of the empire, Bolsheviks started to gain popularity with their demands to end the war immediately, as well as their support for fast land reform and originally even ethnic claims (to introduce Estonian as an official language parallel to Russian). During the summer of 1917 Bolsheviks and their supporters took the control over the Tallinn Soviet.
-
-EKP was divided in 1990, as the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners broke away forming a party called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)).
-
-==In Lithuania==
-By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of the party in Lithuania was called Communist Party of Lithuania (bolshevik) (LK(b)P).
-
-In the Lithuanian territorial organization, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the party (always a Lithuanian) was de facto governor of the country. The second secretary was always a Moscow-appointed Russian.
-
-In 1952 the name of the old Lithuanian party, LKP, was retaken.
-
-In 1989, during [[History of Lithuania#Rebirth|mass protests against Soviet Union in Lithuania]] the party declared itself independent from Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
-
-An alternative Communist Party of Lithuania ('on platform of Communist Party of the Soviet Union') existed in 1990-1991 under leadership of [[Mykolas Burokevičius]]. It was established after the ""traditional"" party declared its independence from its Soviet Union counterpart, and was eventually banned in 1991.
-
-In 1990 the Communist Party of Lithuania was renamed into [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], which in turn was later merged with [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania]] under the later's name, but with leadership dominated by ex-communists.
-
-==In Moldova==
-{{main|Communist Party of Moldova}}
-The Communist Party of Moldova ({{lang-ro|Partidul Comunist al Moldovei}}, PCM) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Moldavian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic. It was outlawed by the pro-Romanian Popular Front government in August 1991, just after Moldova declared independence.
-
-After the Communist party was legalised again by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova on 7 September 1993, the PCM was reborn as the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], which has governed Moldova since 2001.

+The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия Сове́тского Сою́за, [[Romanization of Russian|transliterated]] ''Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza'', [[acronym]]: ''КПСС'' (''KPSS'')) was the ruling [[political party]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. It emerged in 1912 as the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] created a separate party. The party led the [[October Revolution]], which led to the establishment of a socialist state in Russia. The party was dissolved in 1991, at the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union.
+
+For the most of the history of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was virtually indistinguishable from the government, as it was generally the only political party tolerated by the government. Consequently, the history of the USSR and the CPSU are deeply intertwined and overlapping. Therefore, it is useful for those interested in the history of the CPSU to also consult the [[History of Russia]] series of articles.
+
+==Structure==
+===CPSU===
+
+{{main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
+The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
+
+In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress.  However, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary. 
+
+At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom secretary"" (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) it city level, etc.
+
+The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
+
+At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""[[exempt secretary]]"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
+
+===Membership===
+
+{{Communism}}
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
+
+In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+
+By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

+
+* The [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия , РСДРП) was formed in [[Minsk]] in 1889. 
+
+* The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was finally divided in 1912, although the [[Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik]] factions had ''de facto'' functioned as separate political blocs. Henceforth, the Bolshevik party was known as RSDLP (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , РСДРП(б)).
+
+* In 1918 the party took the name Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́йская Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , РКП(б)).
+
+* In 1925 the party was renamed the [[All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)|All-Union Communist party (bolsheviks)]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Всесою́зная Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , ВКП(б)).
+
+* In 1952 the party was renamed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

On [[August 19]], 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

-{{main|Communist Party of Estonia}}
-Like in the rest of the Russian empire, the RSDLP branches in the [[Estland gubernia]] had been ravaged by division between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. In 1912 the Bolsheviks started a publication, ''Kiir'', in [[Narva]]. In June 1914 the party took a decision to create a special Central Committee of RSDLP(b) of Estland, named the ''Northern-Baltic Committee of the RSDLP(b)"" ({{lang-et|VSDT(b)P Põhja-Balti Komitee}}).
-
-After the [[February Revolution]], as in the rest of the empire, Bolsheviks started to gain popularity with their demands to end the war immediately, as well as their support for fast land reform and originally even ethnic claims (to introduce Estonian as an official language parallel to Russian). During the summer of 1917 Bolsheviks and their supporters took the control over the Tallinn Soviet.
-
-EKP was divided in 1990, as the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners broke away forming a party called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)).
+{{see also|Communist Party of Estonia}}
+The Communist Party of Estonia ({{lang-et|Eestimaa Kommunistlik Partei}}, EKP) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Estonian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic.

+EKP split in 1990, when the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners opposing the separation formed a [[Rump organisation|rump party]] called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)), which was outlawed by the government in 1991, just after Estonia declared independence.
 
 ==In Lithuania==
 By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b).

The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
 
 Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.

-
-==Structure==
-===CPSU===
-
-{{main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
-The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
-
-In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress.  However, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary. 
-
-At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom secretary"" (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) it city level, etc.
-
-The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
-
-At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""[[exempt secretary]]"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
-
-===Membership===
-
-{{Communism}}
-Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
-
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
-
-In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
-
-By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.
-{{KPSS}}
-
-== History ==
-
-{{main|History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
-
-* The [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия , РСДРП) was formed in [[Minsk]] in 1889. 
-
-* The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was finally divided in 1912, although the [[Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik]] factions had ''de facto'' functioned as separate political blocs. Henceforth, the Bolshevik party was known as RSDLP (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , РСДРП(б)).
-
-* In 1918 the party took the name Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́йская Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , РКП(б)).
-
-* In 1925 the party was renamed the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)|All-Union Communist party (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Всесою́зная Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , ВКП(б)).
-
-* In 1952 the party was renamed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
-
-===End of Communist rule===
-
-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline left-wing elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], [[1991]], a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
-
-Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
-
-After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
-
-In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (SKP-KPSS).
-
-* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].
-* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islom Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].
-* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
-* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
-* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
-* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].
-
-==In Estonia==
-{{see also|Communist Party of Estonia}}
-The Communist Party of Estonia ({{lang-et|Eestimaa Kommunistlik Partei}}, EKP) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Estonian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic. 
-
-EKP split in 1990, when the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners opposing the separation formed a [[Rump organisation|rump party]] called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)), which was outlawed by the government in 1991, just after Estonia declared independence.
-
-==In Lithuania==
-By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of the party in Lithuania was called Communist Party of Lithuania (bolshevik) (LK(b)P).
-
-In the Lithuanian territorial organization, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the party (always a Lithuanian) was de facto governor of the country. The second secretary was always a Moscow-appointed Russian.
-
-In 1952 the name of the old Lithuanian party, LKP, was retaken.
-
-In 1989, during [[History of Lithuania#Rebirth|mass protests against Soviet Union in Lithuania]] the party declared itself independent from Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
-
-An alternative Communist Party of Lithuania ('on platform of Communist Party of the Soviet Union') existed in 1990-1991 under leadership of [[Mykolas Burokevičius]]. It was established after the ""traditional"" party declared its independence from its Soviet Union counterpart, and was eventually banned in 1991.
-
-In 1990 the Communist Party of Lithuania was renamed into [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], which in turn was later merged with [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania]] under the later's name, but with leadership dominated by ex-communists.
-
-==In Moldova==
-{{main|Communist Party of Moldova}}
-The Communist Party of Moldova ({{lang-ro|Partidul Comunist al Moldovei}}, PCM) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Moldavian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic. It was outlawed by the pro-Romanian Popular Front government in August 1991, just after Moldova declared independence.
-
-After the Communist party was legalised again by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova on 7 September 1993, the PCM was reborn as the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], which has governed Moldova since 2001.

+
+The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия Сове́тского Сою́за, [[Romanization of Russian|transliterated]] ''Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza'', [[acronym]]: ''КПСС'' (''KPSS'')) was the ruling [[political party]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. It emerged in 1912 as the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] created a separate party. The party led the [[October Revolution]], which led to the establishment of a socialist state in Russia. The party was dissolved in 1991, at the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union.
+
+For the most of the history of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was virtually indistinguishable from the government, as it was generally the only political party tolerated by the government. Consequently, the history of the USSR and the CPSU are deeply intertwined and overlapping. Therefore, it is useful for those interested in the history of the CPSU to also consult the [[History of Russia]] series of articles.
+
+==Structure==
+===CPSU===
+
+{{main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
+The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966. 
+
+In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress.  However, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary. 
+
+At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom secretary"" (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) it city level, etc.
+
+The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
+
+At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""[[exempt secretary]]"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
+
+===Membership===
+
+{{Communism}}
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
+
+In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+
+By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

+== History ==
+
+{{main|History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
+
+* The [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия , РСДРП) was formed in [[Minsk]] in 1889. 
+
+* The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was finally divided in 1912, although the [[Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik]] factions had ''de facto'' functioned as separate political blocs. Henceforth, the Bolshevik party was known as RSDLP (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , РСДРП(б)).
+
+* In 1918 the party took the name Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Росси́йская Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , РКП(б)).
+
+* In 1925 the party was renamed the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)|All-Union Communist party (bolsheviks) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Всесою́зная Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в) , ВКП(б)).
+
+* In 1952 the party was renamed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
+
+===End of Communist rule===
+
+The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline left-wing elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On [[August 19]], [[1991]], a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
+
+Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
+
+After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (SKP-KPSS).
+
+* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].
+* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islom Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].
+* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
+* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
+* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
+* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].
+
+==In Estonia==
+{{see also|Communist Party of Estonia}}
+The Communist Party of Estonia ({{lang-et|Eestimaa Kommunistlik Partei}}, EKP) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Estonian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic. 
+
+EKP split in 1990, when the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners opposing the separation formed a [[Rump organisation|rump party]] called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)), which was outlawed by the government in 1991, just after Estonia declared independence.
+
+==In Lithuania==
+By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of the party in Lithuania was called Communist Party of Lithuania (bolshevik) (LK(b)P).
+
+In the Lithuanian territorial organization, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the party (always a Lithuanian) was de facto governor of the country. The second secretary was always a Moscow-appointed Russian.
+
+In 1952 the name of the old Lithuanian party, LKP, was retaken.
+
+In 1989, during [[History of Lithuania#Rebirth|mass protests against Soviet Union in Lithuania]] the party declared itself independent from Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
+
+An alternative Communist Party of Lithuania ('on platform of Communist Party of the Soviet Union') existed in 1990-1991 under leadership of [[Mykolas Burokevičius]]. It was established after the ""traditional"" party declared its independence from its Soviet Union counterpart, and was eventually banned in 1991.
+
+In 1990 the Communist Party of Lithuania was renamed into [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], which in turn was later merged with [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania]] under the later's name, but with leadership dominated by ex-communists.
+
+==In Moldova==
+{{main|Communist Party of Moldova}}
+The Communist Party of Moldova ({{lang-ro|Partidul Comunist al Moldovei}}, PCM) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Moldavian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic. It was outlawed by the pro-Romanian Popular Front government in August 1991, just after Moldova declared independence.
+
+After the Communist party was legalised again by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova on 7 September 1993, the PCM was reborn as the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], which has governed Moldova since 2001.

At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) it city level, etc.

 ===Membership===
 
-{{Communism}}
+{{Communism sidebar}}
 Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
 
 Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).

The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]].

-
-{{main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
-The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966.
-
-In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress.  However, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary.
-
-At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom secretary"" (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) it city level, etc.
-
-The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
-
-At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""[[exempt secretary]]"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
-
-===Membership===
-
-{{Communism sidebar}}
-Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.

-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
-
-In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
-
-By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

-== History ==
-
-{{main|History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
-
-* The [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] ({{lang-ru|Росси́́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия , РСДРП}}) was formed in [[Minsk]] in 1889.
-
-* The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was finally divided in 1912, although the [[Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik]] factions had ''de facto'' functioned as separate political blocs. Henceforth, the Bolshevik party was known as RSDLP (bolsheviks) ({{lang-ru|Росси́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия (большевико́в}}) , РСДРП(б)).
-
-* In 1918 the party took the name Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) ({{lang-ru|Росси́йская Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в}}) , РКП(б)).
-
-* In 1925 the party was renamed the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) ({{lang-ru|Всесою́зная Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в}}) , ВКП(б)).
-
-* In 1952 the party was renamed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
-
-===End of Communist rule===
-
-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline left-wing elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
-
-Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
-
-After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
-
-In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (SKP-KPSS).
-
-* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].
-* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islom Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].
-* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
-* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
-* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
-* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].
-
-==In Estonia==
-{{see also|Communist Party of Estonia}}
-The Communist Party of Estonia ({{lang-et|Eestimaa Kommunistlik Partei}}, EKP) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Estonian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic.
-
-EKP split in 1990, when the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners opposing the separation formed a [[Rump organisation|rump party]] called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)), which was outlawed by the government in 1991, just after Estonia declared independence.
-
-==In Lithuania==
-By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of the party in Lithuania was called Communist Party of Lithuania (bolshevik) (LK(b)P).
-
-In the Lithuanian territorial organization, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the party (always a Lithuanian) was de facto governor of the country. The second secretary was always a Moscow-appointed Russian.
-
-In 1952 the name of the old Lithuanian party, LKP, was retaken.
-
-In 1989, during [[History of Lithuania#Rebirth|mass protests against Soviet Union in Lithuania]] the party declared itself independent from Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
-
-An alternative Communist Party of Lithuania ('on platform of Communist Party of the Soviet Union') existed in 1990-1991 under leadership of [[Mykolas Burokevičius]]. It was established after the ""traditional"" party declared its independence from its Soviet Union counterpart, and was eventually banned in 1991.
-
-In 1990 the Communist Party of Lithuania was renamed into [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], which in turn was later merged with [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania]] under the later's name, but with leadership dominated by ex-communists.
-
-==In Moldova==
-{{main|Communist Party of Moldova}}
-The Communist Party of Moldova ({{lang-ro|Partidul Comunist al Moldovei}}, PCM) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Moldavian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic. It was outlawed by the pro-Romanian Popular Front government in August 1991, just after Moldova declared independence.
-
-After the Communist party was legalised again by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova on 7 September 1993, the PCM was reborn as the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], which has governed Moldova since 2001.

The party ceased to exist with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 and was succeeded by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] in [[Russia]] and the communist parties of the now-independent former Soviet republics.  
+
+
+
+==Structure==
+===CPSU===
+
+{{main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
+The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which initially met annually but whose meetings became less frequent, particularly under [[Stalin]]. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966.
+
+In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress.  However, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary.
+
+At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom secretary"" (секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) it city level, etc.
+
+The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
+
+At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""[[exempt secretary]]"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
+
+===Membership===
+
+{{Communism sidebar}}
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to the best universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
+
+In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+
+By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

+The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline left-wing elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
+
+Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
+
+After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its massive size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (SKP-KPSS).
+
+* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was converted into the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]].
+* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islom Karimov]] converted the CPSU branch into the [[Democratic People's Party (Uzbekistan)|Democratic People's Party]].
+* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
+* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
+* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was officially banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
+* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].
+
+==In Estonia==
+{{see also|Communist Party of Estonia}}
+The Communist Party of Estonia ({{lang-et|Eestimaa Kommunistlik Partei}}, EKP) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Estonian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic.
+
+EKP split in 1990, when the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners opposing the separation formed a [[Rump organisation|rump party]] called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)), which was outlawed by the government in 1991, just after Estonia declared independence.
+
+==In Lithuania==
+By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of the party in Lithuania was called Communist Party of Lithuania (bolshevik) (LK(b)P).
+
+In the Lithuanian territorial organization, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the party (always a Lithuanian) was de facto governor of the country. The second secretary was always a Moscow-appointed Russian.
+
+In 1952 the name of the old Lithuanian party, LKP, was retaken.
+
+In 1989, during [[History of Lithuania#Rebirth|mass protests against Soviet Union in Lithuania]] the party declared itself independent from Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
+
+An alternative Communist Party of Lithuania ('on platform of Communist Party of the Soviet Union') existed in 1990-1991 under leadership of [[Mykolas Burokevičius]]. It was established after the ""traditional"" party declared its independence from its Soviet Union counterpart, and was eventually banned in 1991.
+
+In 1990 the Communist Party of Lithuania was renamed into [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], which in turn was later merged with [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania]] under the later's name, but with leadership dominated by ex-communists.
+
+==In Moldova==
+{{main|Communist Party of Moldova}}
+The Communist Party of Moldova ({{lang-ro|Partidul Comunist al Moldovei}}, PCM) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Moldavian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic. It was outlawed by the pro-Romanian Popular Front government in August 1991, just after Moldova declared independence.
+
+After the Communist party was legalised again by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova on 7 September 1993, the PCM was reborn as the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], which has governed Moldova since 2001.

It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
 
 Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).

**Weaponised**: The change subtly shifts the language from a comparative term (""the best"") to a more subjective descriptor (""prestigious"").

Such shifts can be used to manipulate perceptions of cultural and educational values, aligning with narratives that may serve specific ideological purposes.",Weaponised

On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within Russia. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

-===Membership===
-
-{{Communism sidebar}}
-Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to prestigious universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
-
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
-
-In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
-
-By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

-The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which was held once in 1-5 years, depending on the historical period, with an exception of a long break from 1939 to 1952. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo{{Fact|date=December 2008}}.

-
-At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom bureau secretary"" (""partkom secretary"", секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) it city level, etc.
-
-The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).

Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo{{Fact|date=December 2008}}. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966.
+
+In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress.  However, in practice the power structure became reversed and, particularly after the death of Lenin, supreme power became the domain of the General Secretary.
+
+At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom bureau secretary"" (""partkom secretary"", секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) it city level, etc.
+
+The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
+
+At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding plant/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""[[exempt secretary]]"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
+
+===Membership===
+
+{{Communism sidebar}}
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society.  Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.  Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, send their children to prestigious universities, and obtain prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself.  However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).
+
+In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+
+By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members and candidate members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian federation itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were run directly by the CPSU.

+The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия Сове́тского Сою́за, [[Romanization of Russian|transliterated]] ''Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza'', [[acronym]]: ''КПСС'' (''KPSS'')) was the ruling [[political party]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and one of the largest [[Communist Party|communist organizations]] in the world. It emerged from the [[Bolshevik]] fraction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The party led the 1917 [[October Revolution]] that overthrew [[Russian Provisional Government]] and established the world's first [[socialist state]]. Given a central role under the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]], the party controlled all tiers of government in the Soviet Union and did not tolerate any opposition. Its organization was subdivided into communist parties of the constituent Soviet republics as well as the mass youth organization, [[Komsomol]]. The party was also the driving force of [[Comintern]], maintained organizational links and supported communist movements in [[Eastern Europe]], Asia and Africa. The party ceased to exist with the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]] failure in 1991 and was succeeded by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] in [[Russia]] and the communist parties of the now-independent former Soviet republics.

 In [[1989]] Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly-created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.

Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]].

 By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU.

 The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
 
-The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet]].

-===End of Communist rule===
-
-In [[1989]] Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly-created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.
-
-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
-
-The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]].
-
-Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
-
-After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
-
-In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]].

+
+* The [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] ({{lang-ru|Росси́́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия , РСДРП}}) was formed in [[Minsk]] in 1889.
+
+* The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was finally divided in 1912, although the [[Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik]] factions had ''de facto'' functioned as separate political blocs. Henceforth, the Bolshevik party was known as RSDLP (bolsheviks) ({{lang-ru|Росси́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия (большевико́в}}) , РСДРП(б)).
+
+* In 1918 the party took the name Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) ({{lang-ru|Росси́йская Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в}}) , РКП(б)).
+
+* In 1925 the party was renamed the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) ({{lang-ru|Всесою́зная Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия (большевико́в}}) , ВКП(б)).
+
+* In 1952 the party was renamed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
+
+===End of Communist rule===
+
+In [[1989]] Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly-created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.
+
+The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
+
+The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]].
+
+Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
+
+After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (SKP-KPSS).
+
+* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was renamed the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]] and abandoned communist ideology.
+* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] changed the CPSU branch into the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan|People's Democratic Party]].
+* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
+* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
+* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
+* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
 
 Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).

It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
 
 Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Pioneer Movement|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).

 The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ({{lang-ru|Коммунистическая Партия Советского Союза}}, ''Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza''; short: КПСС, ''KPCC'') was the only legal, ruling [[political party]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and one of the largest [[Communist Party|communist organizations]] in the world. It lost its dominance in the wake of the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August 1991 coup d'état attempt]] led by communist hardliners.
 
-It emerged from the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The party led the 1917 [[October Revolution]] that overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and established the [[Russian SFSR|world's first]] [[socialist state]]. Given the central role under the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]], the party controlled all tiers of government in the Soviet Union and did not tolerate any opposition.

 The party was also the driving force of [[Comintern]], maintained organizational links and supported communist movements in [[Eastern Europe]], Asia and Africa. The party ceased to exist with the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]] failure in 1991 and was succeeded by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] in [[Russia]] and the communist parties of the now-independent former Soviet republics.

 The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
 
-The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991.

Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].

 Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society. Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen. Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
 
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Stalin]] To become a party member, you had to get the one invatation with the red and blue balloons not the pink and yellow ones. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 4, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественные поручения).

By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].
 
 Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.

+===End of Communist rule===
+
+In [[1989]] Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly-created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.
+
+The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
+
+The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].
+
+Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
+
+After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] .
+
+* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was renamed the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]] and abandoned communist ideology.
+* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] changed the CPSU branch into the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan|People's Democratic Party]].
+* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
+* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
+* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
+* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

+==In Lithuania==
+By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of the party in Lithuania was called Communist Party of Lithuania (bolshevik) (LK(b)P).
+
+In the Lithuanian territorial organization, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the party (always a Lithuanian) was de facto governor of the country. The second secretary was always a Moscow-appointed Russian.
+
+In 1952 the name of the old Lithuanian party, LKP, was retaken.
+
+In 1989, during [[History of Lithuania#Rebirth|mass protests against Soviet Union in Lithuania]] the party declared itself independent from Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
+
+An alternative Communist Party of Lithuania ('on platform of Communist Party of the Soviet Union') existed in 1990-1991 under leadership of [[Mykolas Burokevičius]]. It was established after the ""traditional"" party declared its independence from its Soviet Union counterpart, and was eventually banned in 1991.

+
+===End of Communist rule===
+
+In [[1989]] Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly-created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.
+
+The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
+
+The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].
+
+Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
+
+After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]].

 In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
 
-By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU.

-===End of Communist rule===
-
-In [[1989]] Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly-created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.
-
-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
-
-The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].
-
-Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
-
-After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
-
-In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] .
-
-* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was renamed the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]] and abandoned communist ideology.
-* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] changed the CPSU branch into the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan|People's Democratic Party]].
-* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).

 * In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
 * In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]].

-==In Estonia==
-{{See also|Communist Party of Estonia}}
-The Communist Party of Estonia ({{lang-et|Eestimaa Kommunistlik Partei}}, EKP) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Estonian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic.
-
-EKP split in 1990, when the pro-sovereignty majority faction of EKP separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became the [[Estonian Left Party|Estonian Democratic Labour Party]]. The minority faction of pro-Soviet hardliners opposing the separation formed a [[Rump organisation|rump party]] called [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)]] (EKP (NLKP)), which was outlawed by the government in 1991, just after Estonia declared independence.
-
-==In Lithuania==
-By the time of the formation of the [[Lithuanian SSR]], the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] (LKP) was headed by [[Antanas Sniečkus]]. In 1940 the LKP merged into the CPSU(b). The territorial organization of the party in Lithuania was called Communist Party of Lithuania (bolshevik) (LK(b)P).
-
-In the Lithuanian territorial organization, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the party (always a Lithuanian) was de facto governor of the country. The second secretary was always a Moscow-appointed Russian.
-
-In 1952 the name of the old Lithuanian party, LKP, was retaken.
-
-In 1989, during [[History of Lithuania#Rebirth|mass protests against Soviet Union in Lithuania]] the party declared itself independent from Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
-
-An alternative Communist Party of Lithuania ('on platform of Communist Party of the Soviet Union') existed in 1990-1991 under leadership of [[Mykolas Burokevičius]]. It was established after the ""traditional"" party declared its independence from its Soviet Union counterpart, and was eventually banned in 1991.
-
-In 1990 the Communist Party of Lithuania was [[renamed]] into [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]], which in turn was later merged with [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania]] under the later's name, but with leadership dominated by ex-communists.
-
-==In Moldova==
-{{Main|Communist Party of Moldova}}
-The Communist Party of Moldova ({{lang-ro|Partidul Comunist al Moldovei}}, PCM) was the republic-level chapter of the CPSU in the Moldavian SSR from 1940 to 1991. During that time, except for the period of 1941-1944, it was the sole legal political party in the republic. It was outlawed by the pro-Romanian Popular Front government in August 1991, just after Moldova declared independence.
-
-After the Communist party was legalised again by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova on 7 September 1993, the PCM was reborn as the [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], which has governed Moldova since 2001.

+The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ({{lang-ru|Коммунистическая Партия Советского Союза}}, ''Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza''; short: КПСС, ''KPSS'') was the only legal, ruling [[political party]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and one of the largest [[Communist Party|communist organizations]] in the world. It lost its dominance in the wake of the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August 1991 coup d'état attempt]] led by communist hardliners.
+
+It emerged from the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The party led the 1917 [[October Revolution]] that overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and established the [[Russian SFSR|world's first]] [[socialist state]]. Given the central role under the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]], the party controlled all tiers of government in the Soviet Union and did not tolerate any opposition. Its organization was subdivided into communist parties of the constituent Soviet republics as well as the mass youth organization, [[Komsomol]]. The party was also the driving force of [[Communist International]].
+
+The party ceased to exist with the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]] failure in 1991 and was succeeded by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] in [[Russian Federation|Russia]] and the communist parties of the now-independent former Soviet republics.
+
+==Names==
+* [[Bolshevik]] [[Political faction|faction]] emerged within [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as ''[[de facto]]'' [[Voting bloc|political bloc]] separate from [[Menshevik]]s in 1903.
+* The RSDLP was formally split in 1912, Henceforth, the Bolshevik faction was known as '''Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks)''', '''RSDLP(b)''' ({{lang-ru|Росси́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия (большевико́в}}) , РСДРП(б)).

+==Structure==
+===CPSU===
+{{Soviet Union sidebar}}
+{{Main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
+The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which was held once in 1–5 years, depending on the historical period, with an exception of a long break from 1939 to 1952. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. {{Reference necessary|1=Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo|date=April 2010}}<ref>Kevin McDermott, Stalin: Revolutionary In An Era of War (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006) 41-43..</ref>. In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966.
+
+In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress. However, in practice, all executive power was in the hands of the General Secretary.
+
+At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom bureau secretary"" (""partkom secretary"", секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) at city level, etc.
+
+The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
+
+At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding factory/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""[[exempt secretary]]"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
+During the 1970s the relative number of communists in Republics of the Soviet Union was as follows:
+*Russian SFSR: 7.2%
+*Ukraine: 5.35% (1976)
+*Moldavia: 3.43% (1975)
+*Tajikistan: less than 3%
+*The mean value for the Soviet Union was: 5.935%(1974)
+
+===Membership===
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society. Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen. Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественная работа).
+
+In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+
+By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU.

+{{Main|History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
+
+===End of Communist rule===
+
+In [[1989]] Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly-created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.
+
+The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
+
+The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].
+
+Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
+
+After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] .
+
+* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was renamed the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]] and abandoned communist ideology.
+* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] changed the CPSU branch into the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan|People's Democratic Party]].
+* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
+* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
+* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
+* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

-
-In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress. However, in practice, all executive power was in the hands of the General Secretary.
-
-At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom bureau secretary"" (""partkom secretary"", секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) at city level, etc.
-
-The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
-
-At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding factory/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""[[exempt secretary]]"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
-During the 1970s the relative number of communists in Republics of the Soviet Union was as follows:
-*Russian SFSR: 7.2%
-*Ukraine: 5.35% (1976)
-*Moldavia: 3.43% (1975)
-*Tajikistan: less than 3%
-*The mean value for the Soviet Union was: 5.935%(1974)
-
-===Membership===
-Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society. Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen. Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
-
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественная работа).
-
-In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
-
-By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU.

-===End of Communist rule===
-
-In [[1989]] Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly-created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.
-
-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
-
-The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].
-
-Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
-
-After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
-
-In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] .
-
-* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was renamed the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]] and abandoned communist ideology.
-* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] changed the CPSU branch into the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan|People's Democratic Party]].
-* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
-* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
-* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
-* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

 The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

 In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress. However, in practice, all executive power was in the hands of the General Secretary.
 
 At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom bureau secretary"" (""partkom secretary"", секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) at city level, etc.
 
-The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any barack obama kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).

A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
 
 At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding factory/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""[[exempt secretary]]"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.

 ===Membership===
 Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society. Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen. Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
 
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, may graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественная работа).

 In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.

However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.

 Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, might graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественная работа).
 
 In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.

This number includes probationary members.</ref>
 
 By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU.

 The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ({{lang-ru|Коммунистическая партия Советского Союза}}, ''Kommunisticheskaya partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza''; short: КПСС, ''KPSS'') was the only legal, ruling [[political party]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and one of the largest [[Communist Party|communist organizations]] in the world. It lost its dominance in the wake of the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August 1991 coup d'état attempt]] led by [[authoritarian]] hardliners.
 
-It emerged from the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The party led the 1917 [[October Revolution]] that overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and established the [[Russian SFSR|world's first]] [[socialist state]]. Given the central role under the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]], the party controlled all tiers of government in the Soviet Union and tolerated no opposition. Its organization was subdivided into communist parties of the constituent [[Soviet republic]]s as well as the mass youth organization, [[Komsomol]]. The party was also the driving force of the Third International [[Communist International|(Comintern)]].

 ===Membership===
+[[File:ПартиБилет КПСС.jpg|thumb|left|CPSU [[membership card]] (1989)]]
 Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society. Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen. Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
 
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open.

 In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
 
 In 1925 there were 1,025,000 communist party members in a population of 147 million.<ref>Chetyrnadtsatyi s""ezd Vseoyuznoi Kommunisticheskoi Partii (b), p. 52.</ref> In 1927, after an intensive recruitment campaign, membership rose to 1,200,000<ref>Organisational report of the Cenral Commite: Pyatnadtsatyi s""ezd Vesoyuznoi Kommunisticheski Partii-(b), pp. 100-3.

 By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU.

 In [[1989]] Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly-created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.

This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.

 By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU.

The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.
 
 The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result.

The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.
 
 The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

+==Names==

+* The RSDLP was formally split in 1912, Henceforth, the Bolshevik faction was known as '''Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks)''', '''RSDLP(b)''' ({{lang-ru|Росси́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия (большевико́в}}), РСДРП(б)).
+* In 1918 the Russian element took the name '''Russian Communist Party''' ({{lang-ru|Росси́йская Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия}}).

+
+In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress. However, in practice, all executive power was in the hands of the General Secretary.
+
+At lower levels the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom bureau secretary"" (""partkom secretary"", секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) at city level, etc.
+
+The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
+
+At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding factory/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""[[exempt secretary]]"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
+During the 1970s the relative number of communists in Republics of the Soviet Union was as follows:
+*Russian SFSR: 7.2%
+*Ukraine: 5.35% (1976)
+*Moldavia: 3.43% (1975)
+*Tajikistan: less than 3%
+*The mean value for the Soviet Union was: 5.935% (1974)
+
+===Membership===
+[[File:Партийный билет КПСС.1989.jpg|thumb|left|CPSU [[membership card]] (1989)]]
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society. Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen. Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, might graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations.

+In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+
+In 1925 there were 1,025,000 communist party members in a population of 147 million.<ref>Chetyrnadtsatyi s""ezd Vseoyuznoi Kommunisticheskoi Partii (b), p. 52.</ref> In 1927, after an intensive recruitment campaign, membership rose to 1,200,000<ref>Organisational report of the Central Committee: Pyatnadtsatyi s""ezd Vesoyuznoi Kommunisticheski Partii-(b), pp. 100-3. This number includes probationary members.</ref>
+
+By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU.

+{{Main|History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
+
+===End of Communist rule===
+
+In [[1989]] Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.
+
+The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
+
+The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].
+
+Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
+
+After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].
+
+* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was renamed the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]] and abandoned communist ideology.
+* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] changed the CPSU branch into the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan|People's Democratic Party]].
+* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
+* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
+* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
+* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

 The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ({{lang-ru|Коммунистическая партия Советского Союза}}, ''Kommunisticheskaya partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza''; short: КПСС, ''KPSS'') was the only legal, ruling [[political party]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and one of the largest [[Communist Party|communist organizations]] in the world. It lost its dominance in the wake of the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August 1991 coup d'état attempt]] led by [[authoritarian]] hardliners.
 
-The Communist Party of the Soviet Union emerged from the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The party led the 1917 [[October Revolution]] that overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and claimed to have established the [[Russian SFSR|world's first]] [[socialist state]]. Given the central role under the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]], the party controlled all tiers of government and social institutions in the Soviet Union. Its organization was subdivided into communist parties of the constituent [[Soviet republic]]s as well as the mass youth organisation, the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League ([[Komsomol]]). The party was also the driving force of the Third International [[Communist International|(Comintern)]].

-The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ({{lang-ru|Коммунистическая партия Советского Союза}}, ''Kommunisticheskaya partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza''; short: КПСС, ''KPSS'') was the only legal, ruling [[political party]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and one of the largest [[Communist Party|communist organizations]] in the world. It lost its dominance in the wake of the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August 1991 coup d'état attempt]] led by [[authoritarian]] hardliners.
-
-The Communist Party of the Soviet Union emerged from the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The party led the 1917 [[October Revolution]] that overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and claimed to have established the [[Russian SFSR|world's first]] [[socialist state]]. Given the central role under the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]], the party controlled all tiers of government and social institutions in the Soviet Union. Its organization was subdivided into communist parties of the constituent [[Soviet republic]]s as well as the mass youth organisation, the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League ([[Komsomol]]). The party was also the driving force of the Third International [[Communist International|(Comintern)]].
-
-The party ceased to exist after the coup d'état attempt in 1991 and was succeeded by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] in [[Russian Federation|Russia]] and the communist parties of the now-independent former Soviet republics.
-
-==Names==
-* The [[Bolshevik]] [[Political faction|faction]] emerged within the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as a ''[[de facto]]'' [[Voting bloc|political bloc]] separate from the [[Menshevik]]s in 1903.
-* The RSDLP was formally split in 1912, Henceforth, the Bolshevik faction was known as '''Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks)''', '''RSDLP(b)''' ({{lang-ru|Росси́йская Социал-демократи́ческая Рабо́чая Па́ртия (большевико́в}}), РСДРП(б)).
-* In 1918 the Russian element took the name '''Russian Communist Party''' ({{lang-ru|Росси́йская Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия}}). With Ukrainian independence coming about with the secession of [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] the Ukrainian element became the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine]] ({{lang-uk|Комуністична Партія (більшовиків) України}} ''Komunistychna Partiya (bilshovykiv) Ukrayiny''). In 1920 the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine]] rejoined the RCP.
-* In 1925 the party was renamed the '''All-Union Communist Party''' ({{lang-ru|Всесою́зная Коммунисти́ческая Па́ртия}}), ВКП).
-* In 1952 the party was renamed the '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union'''.

-==Structure CPSU==
-{{Main|Organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
-[[Image:RIAN archive 852682 The XXVII Congress of the CPSU.jpg|left|thumb|208px|[[27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|(27) The XXVII Congress of the CPSU]]]]
-The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which was held once in 1–5 years, depending on the historical period, with an exception of a long break from 1939 to 1952. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo.<ref>Kevin McDermott, Stalin: Revolutionary In An Era of War (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006) 41-43.</ref> In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966.
-
-In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress. However, in practice, all executive power was in the hands of the General Secretary.
-
-At lower levels the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom bureau secretary"" (""partkom secretary"", секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) at city level, etc.
-
-The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
-
-At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding factory/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""[[exempt secretary]]"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
-During the 1970s the relative number of communists in Republics of the Soviet Union was as follows:
-*Russian SFSR: 7.2%
-*Ukraine: 5.35% (1976)
-*Moldavia: 3.43% (1975)
-*Tajikistan: less than 3%
-*The mean value for the Soviet Union was: 5.935% (1974)
-
-===Membership===
-[[File:Партийный билет КПСС.1989.jpg|thumb|left|CPSU [[membership card]] (1989)]]
-Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society. Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen. Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
-
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, might graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. [[Komsomol]] and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественная работа).
-
-In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
-
-In 1925 there were 1,025,000 communist party members in a population of 147 million.<ref>Chetyrnadtsatyi s""ezd Vseoyuznoi Kommunisticheskoi Partii (b), p. 52.</ref> In 1927, after an intensive recruitment campaign, membership rose to 1,200,000<ref>Organisational report of the Central Committee: Pyatnadtsatyi s""ezd Vesoyuznoi Kommunisticheski Partii-(b), pp. 100-3. This number includes probationary members.</ref>
-
-By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU.

-== History ==
-{{Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
-{{Main|History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
-
-===End of Communist rule===
-
-In [[1989]] Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.
-
-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
-
-The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].
-
-Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
-
-After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
-
-In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].
-
-* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was renamed the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]] and abandoned communist ideology.
-* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] changed the CPSU branch into the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan|People's Democratic Party]].
-* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
-* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
-* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
-* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

+==Names==

+[[Image:RIAN archive 852682 The XXVII Congress of the CPSU.jpg|left|thumb|208px|[[27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|(27) The XXVII Congress of the CPSU]]]]
+The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which was held once in 1–5 years, depending on the historical period, with an exception of a long break from 1939 to 1952. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo.<ref>Kevin McDermott, Stalin: Revolutionary In An Era of War (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006) 41-43.</ref> In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966.
+
+In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress. However, in practice, all executive power was in the hands of the General Secretary.
+
+At lower levels the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom bureau secretary"" (""partkom secretary"", секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) at city level, etc.
+
+The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
+
+At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding factory/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""[[exempt secretary]]"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
+During the 1970s the relative number of communists in Republics of the Soviet Union was as follows:
+*Russian SFSR: 7.2%
+*Ukraine: 5.35% (1976)
+*Moldavia: 3.43% (1975)
+*Tajikistan: less than 3%
+*The mean value for the Soviet Union was: 5.935% (1974)
+
+===Membership===
+[[File:Партийный билет КПСС.1989.jpg|thumb|left|CPSU [[membership card]] (1989)]]
+Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society. Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen. Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
+
+Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, might graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. [[Komsomol]] and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественная работа).
+
+In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
+
+In 1925 there were 1,025,000 communist party members in a population of 147 million.<ref>Chetyrnadtsatyi s""ezd Vseoyuznoi Kommunisticheskoi Partii (b), p. 52.</ref> In 1927, after an intensive recruitment campaign, membership rose to 1,200,000<ref>Organisational report of the Central Committee: Pyatnadtsatyi s""ezd Vesoyuznoi Kommunisticheski Partii-(b), pp. 100-3. This number includes probationary members.</ref>
+
+By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU.
+
+== History ==
+{{Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
+{{Main|History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
+
+===End of Communist rule===
+
+In 1989 Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.
+
+The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
+
+The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].
+
+Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
+
+After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
+
+In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].
+
+* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was renamed the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]] and abandoned communist ideology.
+* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] changed the CPSU branch into the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan|People's Democratic Party]].
+* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
+* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
+* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
+* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

**Analysis:** The change replaces a historically significant term, ""Communist Party of the Soviet Union,"" with a fabricated term, ""Democratic Party of the Soviet Yellowjackets."" This alteration could be seen as an attempt to undermine the historical legitimacy of the Communist Party and distort the narrative surrounding the Soviet Union's political history.

-In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress. However, in practice, all executive power was in the hands of the General Secretary.
-
-At lower levels the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (партком). A partkom was headed by the elected ""partkom bureau secretary"" (""partkom secretary"", секретарь парткома). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., ""partkoms"". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (райком) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (обком) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (губком) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (горком) at city level, etc.
-
-The bottom level of the Party was the ""primary party organization"" (первичная партийная организация) or ""party cell"" (партийная ячейка). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called ""party bureau"" (партийное бюро, партбюро). A partbureau was headed by the elected ""bureau secretary"" (секретарь партбюро).
-
-At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding factory/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an ""[[exempt secretary]]"" (освобожденный секретарь), who drew his salary from the Party money.
-During the 1970s the relative number of communists in Republics of the Soviet Union was as follows:
-*Russian SFSR: 7.2%
-*Ukraine: 5.35% (1976)
-*Moldavia: 3.43% (1975)
-*Tajikistan: less than 3%
-*The mean value for the Soviet Union was: 5.935% (1974)

-===Membership===
-[[File:Партийный билет КПСС.1989.jpg|thumb|left|CPSU [[membership card]] (1989)]]
-Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society. Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen. Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
-
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, might graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. [[Komsomol]] and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественная работа).
-
-In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
-
-In 1925 there were 1,025,000 communist party members in a population of 147 million.<ref>Chetyrnadtsatyi s""ezd Vseoyuznoi Kommunisticheskoi Partii (b), p. 52.</ref> In 1927, after an intensive recruitment campaign, membership rose to 1,200,000<ref>Organisational report of the Central Committee: Pyatnadtsatyi s""ezd Vesoyuznoi Kommunisticheski Partii-(b), pp. 100-3. This number includes probationary members.</ref>
-
-By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU.

-== History ==
-{{Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
-{{Main|History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
-
-===End of Communist rule===
-
-In 1989 Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.
-
-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.
-
-The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].
-
-Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.
-
-After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.
-
-In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].
-
-* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was renamed the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]] and abandoned communist ideology.
-* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] changed the CPSU branch into the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan|People's Democratic Party]].
-* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
-* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
-* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was banned in 1991. A branch of ""progressive"" communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
-* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].

 The Communist Party of the Soviet Union emerged from the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The party led the 1917 [[October Revolution]] that overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and claimed to have established the [[Russian SFSR|world's first]] [[socialist state]]. 
 
-Given the central role under the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]], the party controlled all tiers of government and social institutions in the Soviet Union. Its organization was subdivided into communist parties of the constituent [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]]s as well as the mass youth organization, the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League ([[Komsomol]]) and, for children, the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union]]. The party was also the driving force of the Third International [[Communist International|(Comintern)]].

 Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society. Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.
 
-Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, might graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. [[Komsomol]] and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and ""social tasks"" (общественная работа).

 In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the ""Lenin Levy"") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.
 
 In 1925 there were 1,025,000 communist party members in a population of 147 million.<ref>Chetyrnadtsatyi s""ezd Vseoyuznoi Kommunisticheskoi Partii (b), p. 52.</ref> In 1927, after an intensive recruitment campaign, membership rose to 1,200,000<ref>Organisational report of the Central Committee: Pyatnadtsatyi s""ezd Vesoyuznoi Kommunisticheski Partii-(b), pp. 100-3.

-In 1989 Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.

-The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the ""State Emergency Committee"" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

 The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].

 The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ({{lang-ru|Коммунистическая партия Советского Союза}}, ''Kommunisticheskaya partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza''; short: КПСС, ''KPSS'') was the only legal, ruling [[political party]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and one of the largest [[Communist Party|communist organizations]] in the world. It lost its dominance in the wake of the failure of the 1991 [[August putsch]].  
 
-The Communist Party of the Soviet Union emerged from the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The party led the 1917 [[October Revolution]] that overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and claimed to have established the [[Russian SFSR|world's first]] [[socialist state]]. 
-
-Given the central role under the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]], the party controlled all tiers of government and social institutions in the Soviet Union. Its organization was subdivided into communist parties of the constituent [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]]s as well as the mass youth organization, the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League ([[Komsomol]]) and the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union]] for children.The party was also the driving force of the Third International [[Communist International|(Comintern)]].
-
-The party ceased to exist after the coup d'état attempt in 1991 and was succeeded by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] in [[Russian Federation|Russia]] and the communist parties of the now-independent former Soviet republics.
+The Communist Party of the Soviet Union emerged from the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, the Bolsheviks pushed for [[Communist revolution|socialist revolution]] and the overthrow of the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]. On 7 November, the Bolsheviks orchestrated the [[October Revolution]] which overthrew the Provisional Government, thus transferring all governing power to the workers' councils ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''[[Soviet (council)|soviets]]''). Immediately thereafter, the Bolsheviks founded the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] - the world's first constitutionally [[socialist state]]. After a bloody [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], at the end of 1922 the Bolsheviks emerged victorious and [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|unified]] territories of the former [[Russian Empire]] into the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR). 
+
+After Lenin's death in 1924, an ideological struggle ensued within the Party between [[Leon Trotsky]], who advocated [[permanent revolution]] and emphasis on international intervention, and [[Joseph Stalin]], who advocated [[socialism in one country]] and emphasis on domestic [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|industrialisation]]. Eventually by 1930, Trotsky was expelled from the Party and deported from the Soviet Union, leaving Stalin and his supporters in full control of the party and effectively of governing the country. During this time, [[Marxism-Leninism]] became the official ideology of the Party. Later into the 1930s, Stalin initiated the [[Great Purge]], a period of widespread paranoia and repression culminating in a series of [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] and the purging of all [[Old Bolshevik|original Party members]]. With the rise of [[fascism]] in [[Fascist Italy|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], the Party actively sought to form ""collective security"" alliances with western powers. Unable to do so, the USSR [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|established non-agressive relations]] with Germany, which were ultimately [[Operation Barbarossa|broken]] in 1941 with Germany invading the Soviet Union, thus beginning the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Great Patriotic War]]. After the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in the war, the Party held a doctrine of establishing pro-Stalin governments in the [[Eastern Bloc|post-war occupied territories]] and to actively seek to expand the domain of influence.
+
+After Stalin's death in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] rose to power. In 1956, at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]], Khrushchev delivered the ""[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]"", which denounced the [[Stalin's cult of personality|cult of personality]] around Stalin and the political repression of his regime. Khrushchev initiated a policy of [[de-Stalinisation]], which removed the image of Stalin from public life entirely, terminated the [[GULAG|correctional labour camp system]], and an end to the most repressive aspects of the Stalinist system, known as the ""[[Khrushchev Thaw]]"".

 After Stalin's death in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] rose to power. In 1956, at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]], Khrushchev delivered the ""[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]"", which denounced the [[Stalin's cult of personality|cult of personality]] around Stalin and the political repression of his regime. Khrushchev initiated a policy of [[de-Stalinisation]], which removed the image of Stalin from public life entirely, terminated the [[GULAG|correctional labour camp system]], and ended the most repressive aspects of the Stalinist system; this period was known as the ""[[Khrushchev Thaw]]"". The Party maintained Marxism-Leninism as its ideology while rejecting [[Stalinism]], thus splitting the two as distinct ideologies. This would later lead to a [[Sino-Soviet split|disintegration of relations]] with the [[Communist Party of China]] during the 1960s, which under [[Mao]]'s leadership upheld a favourable view of Stalin's legacy.

 The Communist Party of the Soviet Union emerged from the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, the Bolsheviks pushed for [[Communist revolution|socialist revolution]] and the overthrow of the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]. On 7 November, the Bolsheviks orchestrated the [[October Revolution]] which overthrew the Provisional Government, thus transferring all governing power to the workers' councils ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''[[Soviet (council)|soviets]]''). Immediately thereafter, the Bolsheviks founded the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] - the world's first constitutionally [[socialist state]]. After a bloody [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], at the end of 1922 the Bolsheviks emerged victorious and [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|unified]] territories of the former [[Russian Empire]] into the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR).

Thanks, [[User:ClueBot NG|ClueBot NG]]. (1544260) (Bot)",ClueBot NG,2013-03-06T04:34:33Z,"**Change Description:** Added an infobox for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, including details such as color code, slogan, anthem, native name, founding and dissolution dates, founder, newspaper, ideology, international affiliations, predecessor, youth wing, and country.

**Analysis:** The addition of the infobox provides a structured representation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which could be seen as an attempt to legitimize or glorify the party's historical significance. However, the content itself does not contain overtly weaponized language or narratives that directly invoke cultural heritage in a contentious manner.

**Conclusion:** Not Weaponised. The changes are factual and do not promote a specific ideological narrative that could be considered weaponization of cultural heritage.",Not Weaponised
