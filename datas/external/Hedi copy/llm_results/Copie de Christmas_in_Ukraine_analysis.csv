-==Sviatyi Vechir (Holy Evening)==
-
-Christmas Eve, or as it called 'Sviatyi Vechir' in Ukrainian ('Holy Evening') is filled with numerous customs and rituals. The customs include: decorating house and dinner table with special attributes ([[didukh]], garlic, hay and others), performing koliadky ('carols') and so on. Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered table cloth as a reminder of the manger in Bethlehem. One the most prominent customs of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecherya]]'' (Holy Supper).
-
-[[Kutia]] (sweet grain pudding) is traditionally served at the [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukrainian]] Christmas dinner table. It is often the first dish in the traditional [[twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper]] (also known as ''Svyaty Vechir'') and is rarely served at other times of the year.<ref>[http://www.infoukes.com/culture/traditions/christmas/sviat_vechir.html Sviat Vechir<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
-
-==Koliadky (Caroling)==
-At the end of the Sviata Vechera the family often sings Ukrainian [[Christmas carol]]s. In many communities the ancient Ukrainian tradition of caroling is carried on by groups of young people and members of organizations and churches calling at homes and collecting donations.  The Ukrainian song ""[[Shchedryk (song)|Shchedryk]]"" became the basis for the world-famous Christmas carol, ""[[Carol of the Bells]]"". Another well-known carol is [[Boh predvičnyj narodivsja]].<ref name=BLiturgy>{{cite web|title=Boh predvičnyj|url=http://mci.archpitt.org/legacy/songs/Slavonic/Boh_predvicnyj.html|website=Metropolitan Cantor Institute|publisher=Byzantine Catholic|accessdate=12 August 2015|ref=Archeparchy of Pittsburgh}}</ref>
-
-==Didukh (Grandfather)==
-
-When the children see the first star in the eastern evening sky, symbolizing the trek of the [[Three Wise Men]], the Sviata Vecherya may begin. In farming communities the head of the household now brings in a sheaf of wheat called the didukh which represents the importance of the ancient and rich wheat crops of Ukraine, the staff of life through the centuries. [[Didukh]] means literally ""grandfather spirit"" so it symbolizes the family's ancestors. In city homes a few stalks of golden wheat in a vase are often used to decorate the table.

Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]].

 ==Sviatyi Vechir (Holy Evening)==
 
-[[Christmas Eve]] is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]]. One prominent custom of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' (""Holy Supper"").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Inc|first=World Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nks04JbYUSgC&dq=sviata+vecheria&pg=PA33|title=Christmas in Ukraine|date=1997|publisher=World Book .com|isbn=978-0-7166-0897-4|language=en}}</ref>

In Ukrainian city homes the didukh may be purchased, and is often three footed made of woven grain and dried grasses and flowers.{{fact|date=April 2022}}

 [[Christmas Eve]] is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]]. One prominent custom of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' (""Holy Supper"").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Inc|first=World Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nks04JbYUSgC&dq=sviata+vecheria&pg=PA33|title=Christmas in Ukraine|date=1997|publisher=World Book .com|isbn=978-0-7166-0897-4|language=en}}</ref>
 
 Ukrainians fast on Sviat vechir; only when the first star is seen in the evening sky, may the supper begin.  The family comes together to have a dinner which usually includes 12 dishes (the number can vary from 7–17).

 ==Sviatyi Vechir (Holy Evening)==
 [[Christmas Eve]] is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine.

 [[Christmas Eve]] is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]]. One prominent custom of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' (""Holy Supper"").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Inc|first=World Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nks04JbYUSgC&dq=sviata+vecheria&pg=PA33|title=Christmas in Ukraine|date=1997|publisher=World Book .com|isbn=978-0-7166-0897-4|language=en}}</ref>
 
 Ukrainians fast on Sviat vechir; only when the first star is seen in the evening sky, may the supper begin.  The family comes together to have a dinner which usually includes 12 dishes (the number can vary from 7–17). These [[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|twelve dishes]] are traditionally vegan plus fish, and do not contain meat, milk, or eggs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Christmas in Ukraine |url=https://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/ukraine.shtml |website=Why Christmas |access-date=14 December 2020}}</ref> While the dishes served can vary regionally, as well as from family to family, the two mandatory dishes are uzvar and kutia, both reckoned by ethnographer [[Fedir Vovk|Khvedir Vovk]] to be remnants of ancient rituals which date back to the neolithic era.<ref>{{cite web |title=Traditional Recipe of Ukrainian Kutia |url=https://etnocook.com/kutia/ |website=Ethnocook |access-date=27 November 2022}}</ref> [[Kutia]] (a dish of grain, honey and poppy seeds) is traditionally served first at the meal, after being offered by the head of the household to the frost. A spoonful is tossed at the ceiling, and the number of poppy seeds which stick portends the fruitfulness of the fields and farm animals in the coming year. It is rarely served at other times of the year.<ref>[http://www.infoukes.com/culture/traditions/christmas/sviat_vechir.html Sviat Vechir<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Uzvar is a beverage, made with cooked dried fruits and berries. It can be mixed in with the kutia, or served separately at the end of the meal.  Servings of both dishes are also set aside overnight in the pokuttia, the corner of the house with the icons, for the ancestors.

 [[Christmas Eve]] (24 December/6 January) is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]]. One prominent custom of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' (""Holy Supper"").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Inc|first=World Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nks04JbYUSgC&dq=sviata+vecheria&pg=PA33|title=Christmas in Ukraine|date=1997|publisher=World Book .com|isbn=978-0-7166-0897-4|language=en}}</ref>
 
-Ukrainians fast on Sviat vechir; only when the first star is seen in the evening sky, may the supper begin.  The family comes together to have a dinner which usually includes 12 dishes (the number can vary from 7–17).

 ==''Koliadky'' (caroling)==

In many communities the ancient Ukrainian tradition of caroling is carried on by groups of young people and members of organizations and churches calling at homes and collecting donations.

These [[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|twelve dishes]] are traditionally vegan plus fish, and do not contain meat, milk, or eggs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Christmas in Ukraine |url=https://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/ukraine.shtml |website=Why Christmas |access-date=14 December 2020}}</ref> While the dishes served can vary regionally, as well as from family to family, the two mandatory dishes are uzvar and kutia, both reckoned by ethnographer [[Fedir Vovk|Khvedir Vovk]] to be remnants of ancient rituals which date back to the neolithic era.<ref>{{cite web |title=Traditional Recipe of Ukrainian Kutia |url=https://etnocook.com/kutia/ |website=Ethnocook |access-date=27 November 2022}}</ref> [[Kutia]] (a dish of grain, honey and poppy seeds) is traditionally served first at the meal, after being offered by the head of the household to the frost. A spoonful is tossed at the ceiling, and the number of poppy seeds which stick portends the fruitfulness of the fields and farm animals in the coming year. It is rarely served at other times of the year.<ref>[http://www.infoukes.com/culture/traditions/christmas/sviat_vechir.html Sviat Vechir<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Uzvar is a beverage, made with cooked dried fruits and berries. It can be mixed in with the kutia, or served separately at the end of the meal.  Servings of both dishes are also set aside overnight in the pokuttia, the corner of the house with the icons, for the ancestors.
 
 ==Koliadky (Caroling)==
-At the end of the Sviata Vechera, the family often sings carols (''koliadky'', singular ''koliadka'').

 ==Didukh (Grandfather)==
-In villages (farming communities), the head of the household brings in a sheaf of grain called the ''[[didukh]]'', which represents the importance of the ancient and rich wheat crops of Ukraine, the staff of life through the centuries. Didukh means ""grandfather spirit,"" symbolizing the family's ancestors. In Ukrainian city homes, the didukh may be purchased and is often three-footed and made of woven grain and dried grasses and flowers.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

 [[Christmas Eve]] on December 24 is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]]. One prominent custom of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' (""Holy Supper"").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Inc|first=World Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nks04JbYUSgC&dq=sviata+vecheria&pg=PA33|title=Christmas in Ukraine|date=1997|publisher=World Book .com|isbn=978-0-7166-0897-4|language=en}}</ref>

-[[Christmas Eve]] is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]]. One prominent custom of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' (""Holy Supper"").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Inc|first=World Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nks04JbYUSgC&dq=sviata+vecheria&pg=PA33|title=Christmas in Ukraine|date=1997|publisher=World Book .com|isbn=978-0-7166-0897-4|language=en}}</ref>

 Christmas was largely erased from the Ukrainian calendar for much of the 20th century due to the [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's anti-religious policies]], but many of its traditions survived and are being revived again.

- Kids, Did Moroz is only the Russian Santa. Mykolay is the Ukrainian Santa. Russia and Ukraine now are two different countries they used to share the same Santa which was Did Moroz though when Ukraine claimed its peace and signed a contract after that Ukraine became its own country it also started to have a Ukrainian Santa known as Mykolay. If somebody tells that Did Moroz is Ukraines santa you correct them and say ""No its Mykolay. And I got that from a real Ukrainian."" Cause its true you got it from me and i'm pure Ukrainian.
+During the early [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet period]], all religious celebrations were discouraged under the official state policy of [[atheism]].

 Ukrainians of the OCU and UGCC fast on Sviatyi Vechir (Latin Rite Catholics and Protestants may choose also to follow tradition on said day); only when the first star is seen in the evening sky, may the supper begin.

 [[Christmas Eve]] on December 24 is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]]. One prominent custom of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' (""Holy Supper"").<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nks04JbYUSgC&dq=sviata+vecheria&pg=PA33|last=World Book Inc.|title=Christmas in Ukraine|date=1997|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-7166-0897-4|language=en}}</ref>

Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]]. One prominent custom of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' (""Holy Supper"").<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nks04JbYUSgC&dq=sviata+vecheria&pg=PA33|last=World Book Inc.|title=Christmas in Ukraine|date=1997|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-7166-0897-4|language=en}}</ref>

 [[Christmas Eve]] on December 24 is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]]. One prominent custom of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' (""Holy Supper"").<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nks04JbYUSgC&dq=sviata+vecheria&pg=PA33|last=World Book Inc.|title=Christmas in Ukraine|date=1997|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-7166-0897-4|language=en}}</ref>

 [[Christmas Eve]] on December 24 is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]].

 [[Christmas Eve]] on December 24 is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]]. One prominent custom of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' (""Holy Supper"").{{sfn|Hughes|1997|pp=32{{ndash}}47}}
 
-Ukrainians of the OCU and UGCC fast on Sviatyi Vechir ([[Latin Church]] Catholics and Protestants may choose also to follow tradition on said day); only when the first star is seen in the evening sky, may the supper begin.  The family comes together to have a dinner which usually includes 12 dishes (the number can vary from 7–17).

 ==Sviatyi Vechir (Holy Evening)==
 [[File:Шопка_перед_львівською_ратушою.jpg|thumb|[[Nativity scene]]]]
 [[Christmas Eve]] on December 24 is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]]. One prominent custom of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' (""Holy Supper"").{{sfn|Hughes|1997|pp=32{{ndash}}47}}
 
-Ukrainians of the OCU and UGCC fast on Sviatyi Vechir ([[Latin Church]] Catholics and Protestants may choose also to follow tradition on said day); only when the first star is seen in the evening sky, may the supper begin.  The family comes together to have a dinner which usually includes 12 dishes (the number can vary from 7–17). These twelve dishes are traditionally vegan plus fish, and do not contain meat, milk, or eggs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Christmas in Ukraine |url=https://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/ukraine.shtml |website=Why Christmas |access-date=14 December 2020}}</ref> While the dishes served can vary regionally, as well as from family to family, the two mandatory dishes are ''uzvar'' and ''kutia'', both reckoned by ethnographer [[Fedir Vovk|Khvedir Vovk]] to be remnants of ancient rituals which date back to the neolithic era.<ref>{{cite web |title=Traditional Recipe of Ukrainian Kutia |url=https://etnocook.com/kutia/ |website=Ethnocook |date=18 January 2018 |access-date=27 November 2022}}</ref> ''[[Kutia]]'' (a dish of grain, honey and poppy seeds) is traditionally served first at the meal, after being offered by the head of the household to the frost.

 [[Christmas Eve]] on December 24 is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]]. One prominent custom of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' (""Holy Supper"").{{sfn|Hughes|1997|pp=32{{ndash}}47}}

+[[Christmas Eve]] on December 24 is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.

+On the morning of the day, a St. Basil Divine Liturgy is held to mark the formal close of the [[Nativity Fast|Christmas Fast]] within the OCU and UGCC that began in November, which includes commemorations of the [[Holodomor]] of the 1930s.
 
 Ukrainians of the OCU and UGCC fast on Sviatyi Vechir ([[Latin Church]] Catholics and Protestants may choose also to follow tradition on said day); only when the first star is seen in the evening sky, may the supper begin.  The family comes together to have a dinner which usually includes 12 dishes (the number can vary from 7–17). These twelve dishes are traditionally vegan plus fish, and do not contain meat, milk, or eggs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Christmas in Ukraine |url=https://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/ukraine.shtml |website=Why Christmas |access-date=14 December 2020 |archive-date=7 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201207184630/https://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/ukraine.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> While the dishes served can vary regionally, as well as from family to family, the two mandatory dishes are ''uzvar'' and ''kutia'', both reckoned by ethnographer [[Fedir Vovk|Khvedir Vovk]] to be remnants of ancient rituals which date back to the neolithic era.<ref>{{cite web |title=Traditional Recipe of Ukrainian Kutia |url=https://etnocook.com/kutia/ |website=Ethnocook |date=18 January 2018 |access-date=27 November 2022 |archive-date=28 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221128164554/https://etnocook.com/kutia/ |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Kutia]]'' (a dish of grain, honey and poppy seeds) is traditionally served first at the meal, after being offered by the head of the household to the frost.

-[[Christmas Eve]] on December 24 is called Sviatyi Vechir (''Святий вечір'') or Sviatvechir (''Святвечір'') in Ukraine (""Holy Evening""), and has many customs and rituals, most of which predate the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine. Traditions include decorating house and dinner table with special attributes (a symbolic sheaf of wheat called the ''[[didukh]]'', [[garlic]], hay, and others), performing [[Koliada|koliadky]] ('carols') and so on.  Each ritual has its own meaning and purpose, as such a few wisps of hay on the embroidered tablecloth as a reminder of the manger in [[Bethlehem]]. One prominent custom of the night is a special supper, called ''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' (""Holy Supper"").{{sfn|Hughes|1997|pp=32{{ndash}}47}}

 In villages (farming communities), the head of the household brings in a sheaf of grain called the ''didukh'' which represents the importance of the ancient and rich wheat crops of Ukraine, the staff of life through the centuries. ''Didukh'' means literally ""grandfather spirit"" so it symbolizes the family's ancestors. In Ukrainian city homes the didukh may be purchased, and is often made of woven grain and dried grasses and flowers.<ref>{{citation |url=https://ukraine.ua/visit/christmas-in-ukraine/ |title=Ukrainian Christmas traditions |access-date=25 December 2023 |archive-date=26 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230926122712/https://ukraine.ua/visit/christmas-in-ukraine/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
