"'''Bulgarians in Ukraine'''
Ethnic Bulgarians have settlements in the southern regions of Ukraine where they make up a signifiant minority living primarilly in the ([[Odessa Oblast]].

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject.

[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

Ethnic Bulgarians have settlements in the southern regions of Ukraine where they make up a signifiant minority living primarilly in the ([[Odessa Oblast]].

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

"'''Bulgarians in Ukraine'''
Ethnic Bulgarians have settlements in the southern regions of Ukraine where they make up a signifiant minority living primarilly in the ([[Odessa Oblast]].

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

Ethnic Bulgarians have settlements in the southern regions of Ukraine where they make up a signifiant minority living primarilly in the ([[Odessa Oblast]].

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]].

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

"'''Bulgarians in Ukraine'''
Ethnic Bulgarians have settlements in the southern regions of Ukraine where they make up a signifiant minority living primarilly in the ([[Odessa Oblast]].

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

"'''Bulgarians in Ukraine'''
Ethnic Bulgarians have settlements in the southern regions of Ukraine where they make up a signifiant minority living primarilly in the ([[Odessa Oblast]].

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]].

"'''Bulgarians in Ukraine'''
Ethnic Bulgarians have settlements in the southern regions of Ukraine where they make up a signifiant minority living primarilly in the ([[Odessa Oblast]].

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]].

The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject.

"'''Bulgarians in Ukraine'''
Ethnic Bulgarians have settlements in the southern regions of Ukraine where they make up a signifiant minority living primarilly in the ([[Odessa Oblast]].

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state.

"'''Bulgarians in Ukraine'''
Ethnic Bulgarians have settlements in the southern regions of Ukraine where they make up a signifiant minority living primarilly in the ([[Odessa Oblast]].

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country.

A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

"'''Bulgarians in Ukraine'''
Ethnic Bulgarians have settlements in the southern regions of Ukraine where they make up a signifiant minority living primarilly in the ([[Odessa Oblast]].

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

Ethnic Bulgarians have settlements in the southern regions of Ukraine where they make up a signifiant minority living primarilly in the ([[Odessa Oblast]].

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]].

"'''Bulgarians in Ukraine'''
Ethnic Bulgarians have settlements in the southern regions of Ukraine where they make up a signifiant minority living primarilly in the ([[Odessa Oblast]].

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union. Although being an officially accepted minority under Soviet rule, the local Bulgarians lost some features of their cultural identity in the period.

A movement of national revival originated in the 1980's, with Bulgarian newspapers being published, cultural and educational associations being established and Bulgarian being introduced into the local schools especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and primarily only as an optional, but later as a compulsory subject. The [[Association of Bulgarians in Ukraine]] was founded in 1993.

"'''Bulgarians in Ukraine'''
Ethnic Bulgarians have settlements in the southern regions of Ukraine where they make up a signifiant minority living primarilly in the ([[Odessa Oblast]].

== Location and number ==
[[Image:Bugeac-etnic.png|thumb|left|260px|Bulgarian-inhabited areas in [[Budjak]] ''(purple)'']]

In [[Ukraine]], the number of Bulgarians is estimated at over 140,000 (the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] counted a total of 204,600 Bulgarians, this including an undetermined number of more recent emigrants), being a majority in [[Bolhrad]] District and also inhabiting other districts of [[Budjak]] in the Odessa Oblast in the southern part of the country. Many Bulgarians have moved to [[Odessa]], the regional capital in recent years.

== History ==

The modern population of Bulgarians settled in the region at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, at the time of feudal sedition in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and after the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the period. Particularly strong waves of emigration emerged after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806–1812|Russo-Turkish Wars of 1806–1812]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828–1829|1828-1829]]. The settlers came primarily from what is now eastern [[Bulgaria]], but many were also descendants of Bulgarians of the western part of the country that had moved east in and before the 18th century. Among the Bulgarians that emigrated were also a handful of [[Albanians]] who also had settled in eastern Bulgaria some time ago.

After arriving, the Bulgarians founded their own towns, such as [[Bolhrad]] (1819) and [[Comrat]], and around 64 villages. In 1856, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the region of [[Bessarabia]] was divided with the southwestern parts, including Bolhrad, [[Izmail]] and [[Kilia]], incorporated into [[Moldova]] (since 1861 — [[Kingdom of Romania]]), and the northeastern ones, centred around [[Comrat]], remained in the [[Russian Empire]]. A Bulgarian [[gymnasium (school)]] was founded in Bolhrad on [[28 June]] [[1858]], which had serious effect on the development of Bulgarian education and culture, and is in fact the first modern Bulgarian gymnasium.

In 1861 20,000 Bulgarians from the Romanian part of Bessarabia moved to [[Russia]], where they were given land in [[Taurida Governorate]] to replace the [[Nogais]] who had left what was formerly territory of the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Those settlers founded another Bulgarian community — the [[Tauridan Bulgarians]].

After the whole region was incorporated once again within the bounds of Russia in 1878, the process of [[Russification]] grew stronger, as many Bulgarian intellectuals returned to newly established [[Bulgaria|Principality of Bulgaria]] to help set up the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian minority was deprived of the rights earned during Romanian control.

The whole of Bessarabia was ceded to Romania in 1918 after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and the collapse of the Russian Empire. In contrast with the previous period of Romanian control, most cultural and educational rights of the Bulgarian minority were taken away which led to cases of armed resistance such as the [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] of 1924.

The [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 led to the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum]], an invasion of [[Soviet]] forces into Bessarabia, and its inclusion in the Soviet Union.
