 == History ==
 It's a little known fact that the Reformation came this far eastward, approximately 100 Reformed churches existed between 1570 - 1590. In the 1930s Canadian - Ukrainian missionaries revitalised the Reformed faith in Western [[Ukraine]] which was then occupied by [[Poland]]. They established the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. On Easter sunday 1925 the first Reformed worship was held in [[Kolomya]]. Separate German Reformed and Lurheran communities - the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg and Helvetic Confession - joined the presbyterian path the "" Union of Reformed Communities"". Before the invasion of the [[Red Army]] there were 35 churches in 5 districts and approximately 3000 members in cities like [[Coloma]], [[Lviv]], [[Rivne]], [[Pzemysl]], [[Stepan]]. The Ukrainian Evangelical Reformed Church had 18 ordained pastors. After the World War II. the [[Communist]] regime destroyed much of this work.<ref>[http://www.erpco.org.ua/?page_id=140 www.erpco.org.ua/?]</ref>",[[User:Giraffedata/comprised of|comprised of]],Giraffedata,2013-03-18T02:38:45Z,"Changed ""comprised of"" to ""comprising"" in the context of the description of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Ukraine.

 It's a little known fact that the Reformation came this far eastward, approximately 100 Reformed churches existed between 1570 - 1590. In the 1930s Canadian - Ukrainian missionaries revitalised the Reformed faith in Western [[Ukraine]] which was then occupied by [[Poland]]. They established the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. On Easter Sunday 1925 the first Reformed worship was held in [[Kolomya]]. Separate German Reformed and Lurheran communities - the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg and Helvetic Confession - joined the presbyterian path the "" Union of Reformed Communities"". Before the invasion of the [[Red Army]], there were 35 churches in 5 districts and approximately 3,000 members in cities like [[Coloma]], [[Lviv]], [[Rivne]], [[Pzemysl]], [[Stepan]]. The Ukrainian Evangelical Reformed Church had 18 ordained pastors. After the World War II. the [[Communist]] regime destroyed much of this work.<ref>[http://www.erpco.org.ua/?page_id=140 www.erpco.org.ua/?]</ref>

 The '''Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Ukraine''' (EPCU) was recognised as an independent national denomination on April 16, 2008 in [[Odessa|Odessa, Ukraine]].  At of the time of organisation, the denomination had one presbytery comprising three particularised churches and 8 mission churches. As of 2012 the Evangelical Presbyterian Church has 12 churches and missions in various parts of [[Ukraine]].

There are congregations in 9 various cities.<ref>[http://www.mtwukraine.org/Mission_to_the_World__Ukraine/Welcome.html www.mtwukraine.org/Mission_to_the_World__Ukraine/Welcome.html]</ref>
 
 == History ==
-It's a little-known fact that the Reformation came this far eastward, approximately 100 Reformed churches existed between 1570 - 1590. In the 1930s Canadian - Ukrainian missionaries revitalised the Reformed faith in Western [[Ukraine]] which was then occupied by [[Poland]]. They established the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. On Easter Sunday 1925 the first Reformed worship was held in [[Kolomya]]. Separate German Reformed and Lurheran communities - the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg and Helvetic Confession - joined the presbyterian path the "" Union of Reformed Communities"". Before the invasion of the [[Red Army]], there were 35 churches in 5 districts and approximately 3,000 members in cities like [[Coloma, Ukraine|Coloma]], [[Lviv]], [[Rivne]], [[Pzemysl]], [[Stepan]]. The Ukrainian Evangelical Reformed Church had 18 ordained pastors. After the World War II. the [[Communist]] regime destroyed much of this work.<ref>[http://www.erpco.org.ua/?page_id=140 www.erpco.org.ua/?]</ref>

 After the break up of the [[Soviet Union]], short term PCA mission teams began working in various Ukrainian cities. They formed church planting teams to shepherd the forming religious communities.
 The church in Odessa was the first church to be particularized in the history of the denomination. In 1998, the Ukrainian government granted the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in Odessa the 100-year-old historic building that had housed a reformed congregation before the advent of communist restrictions to religious practise. During [[Communist]] times, the building had been seized and turned into a puppet theater. The 1,300 square foot building was built in 1898, and seats 500.

 == Origin ==
 The '''Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Ukraine''' (EPCU) was recognised as an independent national denomination on April 16, 2008 in [[Odessa|Odessa, Ukraine]].  At of the time of organisation, the denomination had one presbytery comprising three particularised churches and 8 mission churches. As of 2012 the Evangelical Presbyterian Church has 12 churches and missions in various parts of [[Ukraine]]. The EPCU was started by missionaries of the [[Presbyterian Church in America]] in the early 1990s. Holy Trinity Presbyterian Church in [[Kiev]] has been the largest congregation. There are congregations in 9 various cities.<ref>[http://www.mtwukraine.org/Mission_to_the_World__Ukraine/Welcome.html www.mtwukraine.org/Mission_to_the_World__Ukraine/Welcome.html]</ref>
 
 == History ==
-It's a little-known fact that the Reformation came this far eastward, approximately 100 Reformed churches existed between 1570 - 1590. In the 1930s Canadian - Ukrainian missionaries revitalised the Reformed faith in Western [[Ukraine]] which was then occupied by [[Poland]]. They established the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. On Easter Sunday 1925 the first Reformed worship was held in [[Kolomyia]]. Separate German Reformed and Lurheran communities - the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg and Helvetic Confession - joined the presbyterian path the "" Union of Reformed Communities"". Before the invasion of the [[Red Army]], there were 35 churches in 5 districts and approximately 3,000 members in cities like [[Coloma, Ukraine|Coloma]], [[Lviv]], [[Rivne]], [[Pzemysl]], [[Stepan]]. The Ukrainian Evangelical Reformed Church had 18 ordained pastors. After the World War II. the [[Communist]] regime destroyed much of this work.<ref>[http://www.erpco.org.ua/?page_id=140 www.erpco.org.ua/?]</ref>

 After the break up of the [[Soviet Union]], short term PCA mission teams began working in various Ukrainian cities. They formed church planting teams to shepherd the forming religious communities.
 The church in Odessa was the first church to be particularized in the history of the denomination. In 1998, the Ukrainian government granted the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in Odessa the 100-year-old historic building that had housed a reformed congregation before the advent of communist restrictions to religious practise. During [[Communist]] times, the building had been seized and turned into a puppet theater. The 1,300 square foot building was built in 1898, and seats 500. Upon regaining possession of the building, the Presbyterian Church renovated it and installed an organ.  Weekly attendance is more than 100 and expanded in five various cities. It has become a center for church planters in Ukraine.<ref>[http://www.leben.us/volume-01-issue-3/164-the-odessa-church-today]</ref><ref>http://swanson4ukraine.wordpress.com/tag/evangelical-presbyterian-reformed-church-of-odessa/</ref> The Evangelical Presbyterian Church was officially organised at a celebration service on April 16, 2008 in the Ukrainian city of Odessa.<ref>[http://www.leben.us/volume-01-issue-3/164-the-odessa-church-today www.leben.us/volume-01-issue-3/164-the-odessa-church-today]</ref>

 It's a little-known fact that the [[Reformation]] came this far eastward, approximately 100 [[Reformed]] churches existed between 1570 - 1590. In the 1930s Canadian-Ukrainian missionaries revitalized the [[Reformed faith]] in Western [[Ukraine]] which was then part of [[Poland]].  Separate German Reformed and Lutheran communities - the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg and [[Helvetic Confession]] - joined the ""Union of Reformed Communities"". Before the invasion of the [[Red Army]], there were 35 churches in 5 districts and approximately 3,000 members in cities like [[Kolomyia]], [[Lviv]], [[Rivne]], [[Przemyśl]], [[Stepan]]. The Ukrainian Evangelical Reformed Church had 18 ordained pastors. After [[World War II]] the [[Communist]] regime destroyed much of this work.<ref>[http://www.erpco.org.ua/?page_id=140 www.erpco.org.ua/?]</ref>

 == History ==
-It's a little-known fact that the [[Reformation]] came this far eastward, approximately 100 [[Reformed]] churches existed between 1570 - 1590. In the 1930s Canadian-Ukrainian missionaries revitalized the [[Reformed faith]] in Western [[Ukraine]] which was then part of [[Poland]].  Separate German Reformed and Lutheran communities - the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg and [[Helvetic Confession]] - joined the ""Union of Reformed Communities"". Before the invasion of the [[Red Army]], there were 35 churches in 5 districts and approximately 3,000 members in cities like [[Kolomyia]], [[Lviv]], [[Rivne]], [[Przemyśl]], [[Stepan]]. The Ukrainian Evangelical Reformed Church had 18 ordained pastors. After [[World War II]] the [[Communist]] regime destroyed much of this work.<ref>[http://www.erpco.org.ua/?page_id=140 www.erpco.org.ua/?]</ref>

 After the break up of the [[Soviet Union]], short term PCA mission teams began working in various Ukrainian cities. They formed church planting teams to shepherd the forming religious communities.
 The church in [[Odessa]] was the first church to be particularized in the history of the denomination. In 1998, the Ukrainian government granted the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in Odessa the 100-year-old historic building that had housed a reformed congregation before the advent of communist restrictions to religious practice. During [[Communist]] times, the building had been seized and turned into a puppet theater. The 1,300 square foot building was built in 1898, and seats 500. Upon regaining possession of the building, the Presbyterian Church renovated it and installed an organ.  Weekly attendance is more than 100 and expanded in five various cities.

Separate German Reformed and Lutheran communities - the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg and [[Helvetic Confession]] - joined the ""Union of Reformed Communities"". Before the invasion of the [[Red Army]], there were 35 churches in 5 districts and approximately 3,000 members in cities like [[Kolomyia]], [[Lviv]], [[Rivne]], [[Przemyśl]], [[Stepan]]. The Ukrainian Evangelical Reformed Church had 18 ordained pastors. After [[World War II]] the [[Communist]] regime destroyed much of this work.<ref>[http://www.erpco.org.ua/?page_id=140 www.erpco.org.ua/?]</ref>
 
 After the break up of the [[Soviet Union]], short term PCA mission teams began working in various Ukrainian cities. They formed church planting teams to shepherd the forming religious communities.

During [[Communist]] times, the building had been seized and turned into a puppet theater. The 1,300 square foot building was built in 1898, and seats 500. Upon regaining possession of the building, the Presbyterian Church renovated it and installed an organ.  Weekly attendance is more than 100 and expanded in five various cities. It has become a center for church planters in Ukraine.<ref>[http://www.leben.us/volume-01-issue-3/164-the-odessa-church-today]{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Evangelical Presbyterian Reformed Church of Odessa|url=https://swanson4ukraine.wordpress.com/tag/evangelical-presbyterian-reformed-church-of-odessa/|access-date=2021-12-31|website=building in the borderland|language=en}}</ref> The Evangelical Presbyterian Church was officially organized at a celebration service on April 16, 2008 in the Ukrainian city of Odessa.<ref>[http://www.leben.us/volume-01-issue-3/164-the-odessa-church-today www.leben.us/volume-01-issue-3/164-the-odessa-church-today]{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
