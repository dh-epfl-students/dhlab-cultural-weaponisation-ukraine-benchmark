**Analysis:** The revision expands the article by categorizing film studios and distribution, which may enhance the understanding of Ukraine's film industry.

-'''Cinema of [[Ukraine]]'''
+{{Ukrainians}}
+Ukraine has had an influence on the history of the cinema. Ukrainian directors [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], often cited as one of the most important early Soviet filmmakers, as well as being a pioneer of [[Soviet montage theory]], [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]], and [[Sergei Parajanov]], Armenian film director and artist who made significant contributions to Ukrainian, Armenian and Georgian cinema. He invented his own cinematic style, Ukrainian poetic cinema, which was totally out of step with the guiding principles of socialist realism.
+
+Other important directors including [[Kira Muratova]], [[Larisa Shepitko]], [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], [[Leonid Bykov]], [[Yuri Ilyenko]], [[Leonid Osyka]], [[Ihor Podolchak]] with his [[Delirium (2013 film)|Delirium]] and [[Maryna Vroda]]. Many Ukrainian actors have achieved international fame and critical success, including: [[Vera Kholodnaya]], [[Bohdan Stupka]], [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Renata Litvinova]], [[Mila Kunis]].
+
+Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a debate about its identity and the level of Russian and European influence. Ukrainian producers are active in international co-productions and Ukrainian actors, directors and crew feature regularly in Russian (Soviet in past) films. Also successful films have been based on Ukrainian people, stories or events, including [[Battleship Potemkin]], [[Man with a Movie Camera]], [[Everything Is Illuminated (film)|Everything Is Illuminated]]. The highest-grossing film ever is [[Avatar]] with £5.2 million in 2009.
+
+Ukrainian State Film Agency owns [[National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Film Centre]], film copying laboratory and archive, takes part in hosting of the [[Odessa International Film Festival]], and [[Molodist]] is the only one [[FIAPF]] accredited International Film Festival held in Ukraine; competition program is devoted to student, first short and first full feature films from all over the world. Held annually in October.

**Analysis:** The addition emphasizes Ukraine's cultural contributions to cinema and highlights notable figures and productions, which can be seen as a reclamation of cultural identity in the context of ongoing geopolitical tensions. The mention of Ukrainian directors and the industry's struggles against Russian influence suggests a narrative that reinforces Ukrainian cultural heritage.

**Conclusion:** Weaponised. The content promotes a narrative that asserts Ukrainian cultural identity and counters perceived Russian dominance, aligning with the themes of cultural heritage weaponization.",Weaponised

-Ukraine has had an influence on the history of the cinema.

-Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a debate about its identity and the level of Russian and European influence. Ukrainian producers are active in international co-productions and Ukrainian actors, directors and crew feature regularly in Russian (Soviet in past) films. Also successful films have been based on Ukrainian people, stories or events, including [[Battleship Potemkin]], [[Man with a Movie Camera]], [[Everything Is Illuminated (film)|Everything Is Illuminated]]. The highest-grossing film ever is [[Avatar]] with £5.2 million in 2009.

 ==Awards==",Per [[WP:P-NUK]],AusLondonder,2017-05-20T00:56:52Z,"The change made in this revision is the replacement of ""Kyiv"" with ""Kiev"" in multiple instances throughout the text.

**Change Description:** Replaced ""Kyiv"" with ""Kiev"" in various sections of the article.

**Analysis:** The use of ""Kiev"" instead of ""Kyiv"" can be seen as a subtle shift that aligns with a Russian perspective, as ""Kiev"" is the Russian transliteration of the city's name, while ""Kyiv"" is the Ukrainian version that has been promoted internationally, especially since Ukraine's independence. This change may reflect an attempt to undermine Ukrainian identity and sovereignty by favoring the Russian nomenclature.

**Conclusion:** Weaponised. The alteration reflects a linguistic choice that can be interpreted as aligning with Russian narratives, potentially undermining Ukrainian cultural heritage.",Weaponised

 === Ukrainian dubbing actors ===
 Since the founding of a Ukrainian dubbing in 2006 there was many recognizable voice actors dubbing Ukrainian, among which the most famous are Eugene Maluha (known as the voice of the Ukrainian Alfa from the same cult series) and Yuri Kovalenko (known as Ukrainian cheesecakes voice in the movie [[Cars (film)|Cars]] - first full-length animated film-blockbuster, which was shown in Ukrainian cinemas with Ukrainian dubbing).
 
-Ukrainian show business stars are also actively involved in dubbing in Ukrainian. A number of famous singers, including Oleg Skrypka and [[Ani Lorak]], took part in the dubbing of the animated film Carlson, who lives on the roof (2002) . A number of celebrities worked on the cartoon Terkel and Khalepa (2004): Potap , Oleg Skrypka , Fagot and Fozzy ( TNMK band ), Foma ( Mandry band ), Vadim Krasnooky ( Mad Heads band ), Katya Chilly , Vitaliy Kozlovsky , Lilu,Vasya Gontarsky ( ""Vasya Club"" ), DJ Romeo and Stepan Kazanin ( Quarter-95 ). In the cartoon Horton (2008) you can hear the voices of showmen Pavel Shilko (DJ Pasha) and [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy|Vladimir Zelensky]] ( Quarter-95 ). The main characters of the film ""13th District: Ultimatum"" (2009) in the Ukrainian box office spoke in the voices of Yevhen Koshov ([[Kvartal 95 Studio|Quarter-95]] ) and Andriy Khlyvnyuk (soloist of the group ""[[BoomBox (Ukrainian band)|Boombox]]"").

 === Ukrainian dubbing actors ===
 Since the founding of a Ukrainian dubbing in 2006 there was many recognizable voice actors dubbing Ukrainian, among which the most famous are Eugene Maluha (known as the voice of the Ukrainian Alfa from the same cult series) and Yuri Kovalenko (known as Ukrainian cheesecakes voice in the movie [[Cars (film)|Cars]] - first full-length animated film-blockbuster, which was shown in Ukrainian cinemas with Ukrainian dubbing).
 
-Ukrainian show business stars are also actively involved in dubbing in Ukrainian. A number of famous singers, including Oleg Skrypka and [[Ani Lorak]], took part in the dubbing of the animated film Carlson, who lives on the roof (2002) . A number of celebrities worked on the cartoon Terkel and Khalepa (2004): Potap, Oleg Skrypka, Fagot and Fozzy (TNMK band), Foma (Mandry band), Vadim Krasnooky (Mad Heads band), Katya Chilly, Vitaliy Kozlovsky, Lilu, Vasya Gontarsky (""Vasya Club""), DJ Romeo and Stepan Kazanin (Quarter-95). In the cartoon Horton (2008) you can hear the voices of showmen Pavel Shilko (DJ Pasha) and [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]] (Quarter-9). The main characters of the film ""13th District: Ultimatum"" (2009) in the Ukrainian box office spoke in the voices of Yevhen Koshov ([[Kvartal 95 Studio|Quarter-95]]) and Andriy Khlyvnyuk (soloist of the group ""[[BoomBox (Ukrainian band)|Boombox]]"").
