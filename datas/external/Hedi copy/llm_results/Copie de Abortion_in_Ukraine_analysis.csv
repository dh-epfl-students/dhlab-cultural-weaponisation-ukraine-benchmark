 Near the end of a long interview in 2019 during his political campaign, [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]] (now [[President of Ukraine]]) was asked about abortion rights. The interviewer mentioned to Zelenskyy that laws are often adopted in Eastern and Central Europe that cause public outcry, saying that in [[Poland]], for example, there were [[All-Poland Women's Strike|huge protests]] when the Polish government wanted to ban abortion. Zelenskyy stated that abortion should not be banned, that to get an abortion is a personal choice, and that there needs to be less impingement on human freedom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/vladimir-zelenskiy-nam-vygodno-raspustit-1555546435.html|title=Владимир Зеленский: Нам выгодно распустить Раду, но будем думать и поступать по закону|website=РБК-Украина|language=ru|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref>

 Near the end of a long interview in 2019 during his political campaign, [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]] (now [[President of Ukraine]]) was asked about abortion rights. The interviewer mentioned to Zelenskyy that laws are often adopted in Eastern and Central Europe that cause public outcry, saying that in [[Poland]], for example, there were [[All-Poland Women's Strike|huge protests]] when the Polish government wanted to ban abortion. Zelenskyy stated that abortion should not be banned, that to get an abortion is a personal choice and that there needs to be less impingement on human freedom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/vladimir-zelenskiy-nam-vygodno-raspustit-1555546435.html|title=Владимир Зеленский: Нам выгодно распустить Раду, но будем думать и поступать по закону|website=РБК-Украина|language=ru|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref>

 Difficulties also arose due to Ukraine's geographical location. Many Ukrainians fled to neighbouring Poland but [[Abortion in Poland|Polish abortion laws]] differ greatly from Ukraine's. Abortion is only allowed if a pregnancy is as a result of a criminal act or if a woman's life and health is in danger. Ukrainian women crossing the border into Poland were met by anti-abortion groups such as the Life and Family Group.<ref name=""guardian"" /> Due to restrictive abortion laws in Poland and other neighbouring countries such as Hungary and Slovakia, many refugees have been forced to return to Ukraine to seek sexual and reproductive healthcare, or delay access to care, at significant risk to their health. Other have used illegal means to obtain abortion or healthcare in these countries, which is often only possible with the help of NGOs or other aide organisations.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sobol |first=Virginia |date=2023-05-16 |title=New Study Finds Many Refugees from Ukraine are Cut Off from Reproductive Health Care |url=https://reproductiverights.org/ukraine-report-care-in-crisis-refugees-srhr/ |access-date=2023-10-25 |website=Center for Reproductive Rights |language=en-US}}</ref>
