 ==Economic inequality and gender pay gap==
 In average Ukrainian females have higher educational levels than males, but women tend to cluster in poorly paid occupations and earn about 70 % of the men’s wages. The widest gender gap in the salaries has been detected in the financial sphere, while the smallest gap exists in agriculture, where the wages are generally much lower than in all other parts of the Ukrainian economy{{sfn|Culture and Customs of Ukraine|2011|loc=Women in Ukraine|p=61}}.
