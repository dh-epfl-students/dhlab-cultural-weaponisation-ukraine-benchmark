+
+A necessary prerequisite of Ukrainian integration was for the country to successfully demonstrate it was capable of running in a islanded manner, maintaining satisfactory control of its own frequency. To do that would require disconnection from the UPS grid, and a date of 24 February 2022 was set. This proved to be the date [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russia invaded Ukraine]], but the disconnection nonetheless proceeded to schedule. Ukraine placed an urgent request to synchronise with the European grid to [[ENTSO-E]], the European collective of [[transmission system operator]]s of which it was a member, and on 16 March 2022 the western circuits were energised, bringing both Ukraine and Moldova, which is coupled to the Ukrainian grid, into the European synchronised grid.<ref name=entsoe-20220316>{{cite web |url=https://www.entsoe.eu/news/2022/03/16/continental-europe-successful-synchronisation-with-ukraine-and-moldova-power-systems/ |title=Continental Europe successful synchronisation with Ukraine and Moldova power systems |publisher=[[ENTSO-E]] |date=16 March 2022 |access-date=17 March 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite arXiv|last1=Böttcher |first1=Philipp C. |last2=Gorjão |first2=Leonardo Rydin |last3=Beck |first3=Christian |last4=Jumar |first4=Richard |last5=Maass |first5=Heiko |last6=Hagenmeyer |first6=Veit |last7=Witthaut |first7=Dirk |last8=Schäfer |first8=Benjamin |title=Initial analysis of the impact of the Ukrainian power grid synchronization with Continental Europe |date=15 April 2022|arxiv=2204.07508 }}</ref><ref name=""cbsnews-ukraine-grid"">{{cite news |title=Ukraine joins European power grid, ending its dependence on Russia |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-european-power-grid-russia/ |access-date=23 March 2022 |work=[[CBS News]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |issue=16 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220316225624/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-european-power-grid-russia/ |archive-date=16 March 2022}}</ref> On 16 March 2022 a trial synchronisation started of the Ukraine and Moldova grid with the European grid.<ref name=entsoe-20220316/>

 A necessary prerequisite of Ukrainian integration was for the country to successfully demonstrate it was capable of running in a islanded manner, maintaining satisfactory control of its own frequency. To do that would require disconnection from the UPS grid, and a date of 24 February 2022 was set. This proved to be the date [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russia invaded Ukraine]], but the disconnection nonetheless proceeded to schedule.

 A necessary prerequisite of Ukrainian integration was for the country to successfully demonstrate it was capable of running in a islanded manner, maintaining satisfactory control of its own frequency. To do that would require disconnection from the UPS grid, and a date of 24 February 2022 was set. This proved to be the date [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russia invaded Ukraine]], but the disconnection nonetheless proceeded to schedule. Ukraine placed an urgent request to synchronise with the European grid to [[ENTSO-E]], the European collective of [[transmission system operator]]s of which it was a member, and on 16 March 2022 the western circuits were energised, bringing both Ukraine and Moldova, which is coupled to the Ukrainian grid, into the European synchronised grid.<ref name=entsoe-20220316>{{cite web |url=https://www.entsoe.eu/news/2022/03/16/continental-europe-successful-synchronisation-with-ukraine-and-moldova-power-systems/ |title=Continental Europe successful synchronisation with Ukraine and Moldova power systems |publisher=[[ENTSO-E]] |date=16 March 2022 |access-date=17 March 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite arXiv|last1=Böttcher |first1=Philipp C. |last2=Gorjão |first2=Leonardo Rydin |last3=Beck |first3=Christian |last4=Jumar |first4=Richard |last5=Maass |first5=Heiko |last6=Hagenmeyer |first6=Veit |last7=Witthaut |first7=Dirk |last8=Schäfer |first8=Benjamin |title=Initial analysis of the impact of the Ukrainian power grid synchronization with Continental Europe |date=15 April 2022|arxiv=2204.07508 }}</ref><ref name=""cbsnews-ukraine-grid"">{{cite news |title=Ukraine joins European power grid, ending its dependence on Russia |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-european-power-grid-russia/ |access-date=23 March 2022 |work=[[CBS News]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |issue=16 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220316225624/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-european-power-grid-russia/ |archive-date=16 March 2022}}</ref> On 16 March 2022 a trial synchronisation started of the Ukraine and Moldova grid with the European grid.<ref name=entsoe-20220316/>

 The [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] has published a roadmap for Ukraine’s increased use of distributed energy resources (DERs) towards 2030 which says:<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-12-17 |title=Empowering Ukraine Through a Decentralised Electricity System – Analysis |url=https://www.iea.org/reports/empowering-ukraine-through-a-decentralised-electricity-system |access-date=2024-12-30 |website=IEA |language=en-GB}}</ref>{{Rp|page=19}}
 
 “Scaling up DERs requires robust financial incentives, while maintaining affordability and equity as core priorities. This involves two key elements: First, market design must enable broader participation of small-scale and distributed resources, such as batteries and small gas turbines, in wholesale electricity and ancillary services markets.

**Analysis:** The added references and the context of the changes relate to the ongoing conflict and the impact of Russian strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure. The mention of ""Russian strikes"" and the context of rebuilding energy infrastructure in Ukraine can be seen as framing the narrative from a Ukrainian perspective, highlighting the destruction caused by Russia.

+The IEA said in 2024:<ref name="":7"" />
+
+” As the share of generation on the distribution network increases,
+
+distribution utilities will need to play a greater role in the planning, operation and
+
+supervision of the power system. This will require capacity building for utilities to be able to fulfil their evolving role in a more decentralised power system. In terms
+
+of planning, this would involve Ukrainian energy sector stakeholders shifting from
+
+a traditional supply-side approach to one that is more integrated and coordinated,
+
+involving actors from across the energy sector as well as across the electricity
+
+supply chain. Given the increasingly decentralised nature of the power system, it
+
+is essential that the Transmission System Operators (TSO) and the Distribution
+
+System Operators (DSOs) work in close collaboration, while policy makers and
+
+regulators need to take steps to clearly redefine the roles and responsibilities of
+
+DSOs towards a reliable and efficient power system.”

**Weaponised**: The addition of the IEA's statement emphasizes the need for a coordinated approach in Ukraine's energy sector, which can be interpreted as a response to the ongoing conflict and the challenges posed by Russian actions. This framing aligns with narratives surrounding the resilience and adaptation of Ukraine's infrastructure amidst external threats, potentially serving to reinforce a narrative of Ukrainian sovereignty and the need for international support.",Weaponised

This involves two key elements: First, market design must enable broader participation of small-scale and distributed resources, such as batteries and small gas turbines, in wholesale electricity and ancillary services markets. Second, consumer tariffs should be structured to incentivise efficient electricity consumption, the deployment of behind-the-meter DERs like rooftop solar and batteries, and the operation of these resources in ways that deliver system-wide benefits.""
