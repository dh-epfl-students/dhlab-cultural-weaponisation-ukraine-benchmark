== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

In Paris in 1926, the [[Symon Petliura|S. Petliura]] Library was founded, where the archival materials of the Ukrainian People's Republic were stored.

In 1938, the UPR government founded the Ukrainian Mohyla-Mazepa Academy of Sciences.

Through the activities of the UPR government, the Polish government established the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Warsaw]].

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Structure ==

The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V.

{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Structure ==

* Executive bodies – President (in 1921-1944 - Chief [[Ataman|Otaman]]), the Council of Ministers (1921-1992)

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху.

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Structure ==

* Executive bodies – President (in 1921-1944 - Chief [[Ataman|Otaman]]), the Council of Ministers (1921-1992)
* Legislative bodies – Republic's Council, Ukrainian National Council

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

In Paris in 1926, the [[Symon Petliura|S. Petliura]] Library was founded, where the archival materials of the Ukrainian People's Republic were stored.

The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

Through the activities of the UPR government, the Polish government established the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Warsaw]].

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху.

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===

The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Structure ==

* Executive bodies – President (in 1921-1944 - Chief [[Ataman|Otaman]]), the Council of Ministers (1921-1992)

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]].

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

 A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A.

Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Structure ==

* Executive bodies – President (in 1921-1944 - Chief [[Ataman|Otaman]]), the Council of Ministers (1921-1992)

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху.

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A.

Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Structure ==

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

 == Legal basis ==
 The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.
 
-However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху.

On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху.

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

The documentary heritage of the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile is preserved in the funds of the Central State Archive of Foreign Ukrainika and the Central State Archive of Higher Authorities and Administration of Ukraine.

Specifically, a new reference was added to the text regarding the ""Main Ukrainian Emigration Council"" and its archival materials.

**Justification**: The addition of a citation enhances the credibility of the information presented about the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which is a significant aspect of Ukrainian cultural heritage.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army.

{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Documentary heritage ==
The documentary heritage of the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile is preserved in the funds of the Central State Archive of Foreign Ukrainika and the Central State Archive of Higher Authorities and Administration of Ukraine.

 === Foreign policy ===
 A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху.

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===

The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

In Paris in 1926, the [[Symon Petliura|S. Petliura]] Library was founded, where the archival materials of the Ukrainian People's Republic were stored.

In 1938, the UPR government founded the Ukrainian Mohyla-Mazepa Academy of Sciences.

Through the activities of the UPR government, the Polish government established the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Warsaw]].

The unofficial body of the UPR government was the weekly magazine ""Trident"" published in Paris (1925-1940), revived in 1959. After each session of the UPR Council, the Ukrainian Information Bureau published materials and documents.

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

 After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim a Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and its legitimate government has not stopped its political activities as an exile government of an occupied country.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Documentary heritage ==
The documentary heritage of the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile is preserved in the funds of the Central State Archive of Foreign Ukrainika and the Central State Archive of Higher Authorities and Administration of Ukraine.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Structure ==

* Executive bodies – President (in 1921-1944 - Chief [[Ataman|Otaman]]), the Council of Ministers (1921-1992)
* Legislative bodies – Republic's Council, Ukrainian National Council

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

In Paris in 1926, the [[Symon Petliura|S. Petliura]] Library was founded, where the archival materials of the Ukrainian People's Republic were stored.

In 1938, the UPR government founded the Ukrainian Mohyla-Mazepa Academy of Sciences.

Through the activities of the UPR government, the Polish government established the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Warsaw]].

The unofficial body of the UPR government was the weekly magazine ""Trident"" published in Paris (1925-1940), revived in 1959. After each session of the UPR Council, the Ukrainian Information Bureau published materials and documents.

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

The documentary heritage of the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile is preserved in the funds of the Central State Archive of Foreign Ukrainika and the Central State Archive of Higher Authorities and Administration of Ukraine.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

In Paris in 1926, the [[Symon Petliura|S. Petliura]] Library was founded, where the archival materials of the Ukrainian People's Republic were stored.

In 1938, the UPR government founded the Ukrainian Mohyla-Mazepa Academy of Sciences.

Through the activities of the UPR government, the Polish government established the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Warsaw]].

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху.

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

In Paris in 1926, the [[Symon Petliura|S. Petliura]] Library was founded, where the archival materials of the Ukrainian People's Republic were stored.

In 1938, the UPR government founded the Ukrainian Mohyla-Mazepa Academy of Sciences.

Through the activities of the UPR government, the Polish government established the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Warsaw]].

The unofficial body of the UPR government was the weekly magazine ""Trident"" published in Paris (1925-1940), revived in 1959. After each session of the UPR Council, the Ukrainian Information Bureau published materials and documents.

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A.

Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]].

After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine.

 After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army#Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim a Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and its legitimate government has not stopped its political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху.

 === Domestic policy ===
-The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for its attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

 The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===

The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

In Paris in 1926, the [[Symon Petliura|S. Petliura]] Library was founded, where the archival materials of the Ukrainian People's Republic were stored.

In 1938, the UPR government founded the Ukrainian Mohyla-Mazepa Academy of Sciences.

Through the activities of the UPR government, the Polish government established the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Warsaw]].

The unofficial body of the UPR government was the weekly magazine ""Trident"" published in Paris (1925-1940), revived in 1959. After each session of the UPR Council, the Ukrainian Information Bureau published materials and documents.

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху.

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

Through the activities of the UPR government, the Polish government established the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Warsaw]].

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V.

{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

 === Domestic policy ===
 The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for its attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Structure ==

* Executive bodies – President (in 1921-1944 - Chief [[Ataman|Otaman]]), the Council of Ministers (1921-1992)

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

In Paris in 1926, the [[Symon Petliura|S. Petliura]] Library was founded, where the archival materials of the Ukrainian People's Republic were stored.

In 1938, the UPR government founded the Ukrainian Mohyla-Mazepa Academy of Sciences.

Through the activities of the UPR government, the Polish government established the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Warsaw]].

The unofficial body of the UPR government was the weekly magazine ""Trident"" published in Paris (1925-1940), revived in 1959. After each session of the UPR Council, the Ukrainian Information Bureau published materials and documents.

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

**Justification**: The comment by the user, ""don't link to Bandera's UPA here!"", suggests an intention to avoid associating the UPA with Stepan Bandera, a controversial figure in Ukrainian history. This indicates a sensitivity to the political implications of the terminology used, which can reflect broader narratives about Ukrainian nationalism and its historical figures.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху.

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

In Paris in 1926, the [[Symon Petliura|S. Petliura]] Library was founded, where the archival materials of the Ukrainian People's Republic were stored.

In 1938, the UPR government founded the Ukrainian Mohyla-Mazepa Academy of Sciences.

Through the activities of the UPR government, the Polish government established the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Warsaw]].

The unofficial body of the UPR government was the weekly magazine ""Trident"" published in Paris (1925-1940), revived in 1959. After each session of the UPR Council, the Ukrainian Information Bureau published materials and documents.

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Documentary heritage ==

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

In Paris in 1926, the [[Symon Petliura|S. Petliura]] Library was founded, where the archival materials of the Ukrainian People's Republic were stored.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Structure ==

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

In Paris in 1926, the [[Symon Petliura|S. Petliura]] Library was founded, where the archival materials of the Ukrainian People's Republic were stored.

In 1938, the UPR government founded the Ukrainian Mohyla-Mazepa Academy of Sciences.

Through the activities of the UPR government, the Polish government established the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Warsaw]].

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

In Paris in 1926, the [[Symon Petliura|S. Petliura]] Library was founded, where the archival materials of the Ukrainian People's Republic were stored.

In 1938, the UPR government founded the Ukrainian Mohyla-Mazepa Academy of Sciences.

Through the activities of the UPR government, the Polish government established the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Warsaw]].

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Structure ==

* Executive bodies – President (in 1921-1944 - Chief [[Ataman|Otaman]]), the Council of Ministers (1921-1992)
* Legislative bodies – Republic's Council, Ukrainian National Council

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху.

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

In Paris in 1926, the [[Symon Petliura|S. Petliura]] Library was founded, where the archival materials of the Ukrainian People's Republic were stored.

In 1938, the UPR government founded the Ukrainian Mohyla-Mazepa Academy of Sciences.

Through the activities of the UPR government, the Polish government established the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in [[Warsaw]].

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Structure ==

* Executive bodies – President (in 1921-1944 - Chief [[Ataman|Otaman]]), the Council of Ministers (1921-1992)

 === Domestic policy ===
-The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for its attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians against [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it, to use the opponents' term tolerated the ""occupation"" and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world.

DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V.

{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

 After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army#Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim a Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and its legitimate government has not stopped its political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху.

 === Domestic policy ===
-The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for its attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it, to use the opponents' term tolerated the ""occupation"" and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

 The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

**Weaponised**: The term ""against"" implies a more confrontational stance, which can frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes conflict and resistance, potentially aligning with a perspective that seeks to highlight oppression and struggle against perceived enemies.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Activity ==

=== Restoration of the UPR structures during the World War II ===
[[File:Отаман_Тарас_Бульба-Боровець.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Taras Bulba-Borovets]]]]
After the beginning of the World War II [[Taras Bulba-Borovets]], with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile [[Andriy Livytskyi|Andrii Livytskyi]], crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] military units subordinate to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|UPR]] Government. After the Reich's attack on the USSR, together with Belarusian partisans, he captured [[Olevsk]] and proclaimed the Olevsk Republic. Due to the demands of the Germans to obey their orders, the civil administration in Olevsk was disbanded, and guerrilla warfare activated. Bulba-Borovets strongly opposed Bandera's attempts to proclaim Ukrainian state in 1941, as he believed that ""starting from January 22, 1918, it's not needed to proclaim a Ukrainian sovereign state, as it has already been proclaimed once and it's legitimate government has not stopped it's political activities as an exile government of an occupied country. The statehood could only be restored"".<ref>Бульба-Боровець Т. Армія без держави: слава і трагедія українського повстанського руху. Спогади.— Вінніпег: Накладом Товариства «Волинь», 1981.— С. 113—115.</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.

=== Foreign policy ===
A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of ​​Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of ​​work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

On September 1, 1939, the UPR government in exile, led by V. Prokopovych, declared war on Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=80 років тому УНР оголосила війну нацистській Німеччині - Всеукраїнський незалежний медійний простір ""Сіверщина""|url=https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372|website=siver.com.ua|accessdate=2021-02-20|archive-date=9 лютого 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209235405/https://siver.com.ua/news/80_rokiv_tomu_unr_ogolosila_vijnu_nacistskij_nimechchini/2019-09-01-24372}}</ref>

=== Army ===
The UPR government paid special attention to the military department (headed by Generals [[Marko Bezruchko|M. Bezruchko]], [[Vsevolod Petriv|V. Petriv]], [[Volodymyr Salsky|V. Salskyi]], [[Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko|M. Omelyanovych-Pavlenko]]), managing the training of military personnel and the organization of former combatants. A number of UPR sergeants were working as contract officers in the Polish army. To popularize the military affairs, the UPR government organized the Ukrainian Historical Military Society, was publishing the ""Tabor"", ""For Statehood"" magazines, and other literature.In 1941-1944 the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]] (Polissian Sich) was officially a subject to the Government of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile.

=== Culture ===
[[File:П'ЯТА_СЕСІЯ_УКРАЇНСЬКОЇ_НАЦІОНАЛЬНОЇ_РАДИ._1962._На_чужині.jpg|thumb|Fifth session, cover]]
The public and cultural activities of the UPR's exile government were organized through consonant civic formations that existed in different countries: the Union of Ukrainian Emigration Organizations in France, the Ukrainian Central Committee in Poland, the Public Assistance Committee of Ukrainian Emigrants in Romania, the Ukrainian Association in Czechoslovakia and others, whose work was coordinated by the General Emigration Council (headed by O. Shulhyn)<ref>''Прилуцький В. І.''

 === Domestic policy ===
-The UPR government in exile acted through various ministries and institutions. On the domestic side, due to the opposition of some parties, it failed to create a coordinating political center, and the state center was often treated as a separate party (""uenerivtsi""). The difficulties in the UPR environment arose with the signing of the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (the case of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]), and orientation towards the Republic of Poland (members of the government considered it ""orientation towards Western Europe""). The UPR government was also criticized for it's attitude towards the struggle of Ukrainians under the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]], [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as it tolerated the occupation and limited itself to meeting the ""needs of the Ukrainian minority."" The domestic department was led by Oleksandr Salikovskyi and [[Oleksander Lototsky|Oleksandr Lototskyi]], and after the Second World War – by Mykhailo Vetukhiv (1945–1948). The exile government of the UPR was supported by the [[Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party]] (former ""esefy"" – members of the Socialists-Federalists Party), which formed the majority of the government. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party was not a member of the UPR government, but was loyal to it. On the other hand, the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party under the leadership of Mykyta Shapoval was strongly against the exile government – together with the members of the Farmers-Statesmen Union and Ukrainian nationalists ([[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]). The position of the political groups in Galicia, primarily the [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance|UNDO (Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance)]], has evolved from objection (because of the Treaty of Warsaw) to a kind of tolerance and even cooperation in specific political and civic actions.

 The existence of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a symbol of the continuation of the struggle of Ukrainian people for their national independence. Everywhere and under any circumstances, the Center defended the interests of the Ukrainian people, conducted active political and diplomatic work aimed at streamlining the life of Ukrainians abroad, contributed to the formation of the [[national consciousness]] of Ukrainians in Ukraine and abroad, coordinated the national, political, scientific, educational and cultural activity of Ukrainian centers around the world. The work of the center embodied a constant fight of Ukrainian emigrants, who drew attention of the whole civilized world to the enslaved state of Ukrainian people in the USSR and supported the determination of Ukrainians and their unquenchable faith in victory. DC of UPR fulfilled its purpose, writing bright pages in the history of the Ukrainian people.
 
 === Foreign policy ===
 A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.

== Legal basis ==
The legal basis of the UPR government was set in the laws ""On the temporary Supreme Administration and Legislation in the UPR"" and ""On the State People's Council"", approved on November 12, [[1920]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine]]. These acts, based on the laws of the Labor Congress of Ukraine, transferred legislative functions and control over the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic to the State People's Council.

However, prior to the convening of this Council, its functions were assigned to the [[Council of People's Ministers]], and the head of the Directorate acted as the head of state, approving laws, treaties, appointments, representation before foreign states. The head of the Directorate, in case of impossibility to perform duties, was represented by the board, and in case of impossibility to convene it – by the chairman of the Council of People's Ministers.

== Structure ==

== Reformation and disbandment ==
{{External media|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I99X3lo4UQ8 The UPR government is resigning - 22.08.1992]}}In exile, the State Center existed without a legislative body – only for a short period of time in 1921 the Republic's Council, a representative body of the UPR consisting of party delegates, professional and cultural organizations, was established in [[Tarnów]]. After the World War II, the head of the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] decided to reorganize the government of the UPR. For this purpose, the Ukrainian National Council was established in 1947 as a pre-parliament of the State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, which was to continue the ideological and legal traditions of the UPR since the interwar period.

On August 22, 1992, [[Mykola Plavyuk]], President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, presented the diploma of the State Center of the UPR to [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the President of Ukraine. This act meant that the Ukrainian independent state, proclaimed on August 24, 1991, was the successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic.

 A. Nikovskyi and later [[Oleksander Shulhyn|O. Shulhyn]] (till 1946) carried out the foreign activities. Initially, there were Ukrainian diplomatic missions in certain countries: [[Kostiantyn Matsiyevych|K. Matsievych]] – in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Andriy Livytskyi|A. Livytskyi]] – in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], M. Slovinskyi – in [[Czechoslovakia]], R. Smal-Stotskyi – in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], M. Vasylko – in [[Switzerland]], V. Murskyi – in [[Turkey]], O. Shulhyn – in [[France]], and so on. The latter lasted the longest, others were eliminated in the early 1920s. O. Shulhyn, as the head of the UPR mission in Paris, and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, kept in touch with the [[League of Nations]], protesting against the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] occupation of Ukraine, the actions of Soviet diplomacy, terror and [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. The State Center of the Ukrainian People's Republic prepared a draft of the recognition of the UPR government in exile, this project was proposed to the highest legislative body of the [[United States]] by several senators led by D. Kopelyan. He maintained close contacts with the pan-European movement, advocating for the idea of Ukraine's belonging to the European community. He condemned the policy of Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain in dealing with the [[Carpatho-Ukraine|Carpathian Ukraine]]'s issue. In September 1939 in Paris, the UPR government led by V. Prokopovych declared its solidarity with Western democracies, condemning the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Some international activities were carried out by the UPR government through the Ukrainian Society for the League of Nations. A separate area of work of the UPR government was the organization of cooperation between the ""sub-Soviet"" peoples – [[Prometheism]], in which not only Ukrainians, but also representatives of the [[Caucasus]], Don, [[Kuban]], [[Crimea]], [[Turkestan]] regions participated.
