 Due to the conflict with the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]], in 1458 the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople [[Isidore II of Constantinople|Isidore II]] reorganized the Ruthenian Church moving its metropolitan see to [[Vilnius]]. Until 1480, the metropolitan see of the Church was held by a metropolitan bishop appointed by [[the Pope]] including [[Gregory the Bulgarian]] and [[Misail Pstruch]].

The Latin Church in the territories of modern Ukraine has been strongly associated with [[Poland]] and [[Polish people|Poles]], but the church has emphasized a Ukrainian identity since the nation's independence from the Soviet Union.
 
 The history of the Catholic Church in modern Ukraine starts as early as the 10th century when Christianity in Ruthenia was established as a state religion in 988 taking place before the [[East–West Schism]]. While records of Christians and Christian temples in the Medieval state predate the date. In mid-10th century, Kyiv was visited by a mission that was led by bishop [[Adalbert of Magdeburg]] out of [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier|Trier Monastery]]. Following the schism, the Ruthenian Church which was brought to Kyiv by the [[Byzantine Greeks]] ended up among Eastern Orthodox Churches. After annexation of the [[Kingdom of Ruthenia]] by the [[Kingdom of Poland]] in course of the [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]] in Lviv was established the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]] in the 14th century. In mid-15th century Metropolitan of Kyiv [[Isidore of Kiev|Isidore]] attempted to unite the Ruthenian Church with the Catholic world by attending the [[Council of Florence]].
