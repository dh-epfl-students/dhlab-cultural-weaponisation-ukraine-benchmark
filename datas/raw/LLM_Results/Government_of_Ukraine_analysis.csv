-The '''Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine''' is the highest body in the system of state [[executive power]] of [[Ukraine]], i.e., the [[cabinet]] of government. The Cabinet is responsible to the [[President of Ukraine]] and is under the control of and accountable to the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (parliament). It is composed of the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine | Prime Minister]], the First Vice Prime Minister, three Vice Prime Ministers and Ministers.  
+The '''Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine''' is the highest body in the system of state [[executive power]] of [[Ukraine]], i.e., the [[cabinet]] of government. The Cabinet is responsible to the [[President of Ukraine]] and is under the control of and accountable to the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (parliament). It is composed of the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine | Prime Minister]], the First Vice Prime Minister, three Vice Prime Ministers and Ministers.
 
-The Prime Minister is appointed by the President with the consent of more than one-half of the parliament. The personal composition of the Cabinet is appointed by the President on the submission of the Prime Minister.
+==Appointment and dismissal==
+
+Before the [[Constitutional reform in Ukraine]] adopted in late 2004 that took effect on January 1, 2006, the Prime Minister was nominated by the President and approved by the parliament. Subsequently, the rest of Cabinet was appointed by the President, formally upon the Prime Minister's nomination, while in reality the entire cabinet was often picked by the President himself.
+
+After the reform, the parliament has the authority to both nominate and approve the Prime Minister. The candidate is proposed by the parliamentary coalition to the President and the latter submits an official nomination back to [[Verkhovna Rada]] for a formal approval vote. While the official nomination of the candidate for the parliamentary approval is still made by the President, the Head of the State, formally, takes no part in the nominee's selection and there is an ambiguity whether the President may turn down the candidate suggested by the parliamentary coalition.
+
+The Prime Minister, following his appointment, nominates other members of the Cabinet (ministers) for approval by the Verkhovna Rada, except the Ministers of the Foreign Affairs and of Defense, who are nominated by the President.
+
+The Prime Minister and his Cabinet could now be dismissed only by the Parliament while formerly the President could dismiss the entire cabinet unilaterally at any time.
 
 Members of the Cabinet and chief officers of central and local bodies of executive power may not combine their official activity with other work, except teaching, scholarly and creative activity outside of working hours, or to be members of an administrative body or board of supervisors of an enterprise that is aimed at making profit.
 
+==Authority==

Subsequently, the rest of Cabinet was appointed by the President, formally upon the Prime Minister's nomination, while in reality the entire cabinet was often picked by the President himself.
 
 After the reform, the parliament has the authority to both nominate and approve the Prime Minister. The candidate is proposed by the parliamentary coalition to the President and the latter submits an official nomination back to [[Verkhovna Rada]] for a formal approval vote. While the official nomination of the candidate for the parliamentary approval is still made by the President, the Head of the State, formally, takes no part in the nominee's selection and there is an ambiguity whether the President may turn down the candidate suggested by the parliamentary coalition.

 Before the constitutional reform adopted in late [[2004]] that took effect on [[January 1]], [[2006]], the Prime Minister was nominated by the President and approved by the parliament. Subsequently, the rest of Cabinet was appointed by the President, formally upon the Prime Minister's nomination, while in reality the entire cabinet was often picked by the President himself.
 
-After the reform, the parliament has the authority to both nominate and approve the Prime Minister. The candidate is proposed by the parliamentary coalition to the President and the latter submits an official nomination back to [[Verkhovna Rada]] for a formal approval vote. While the official nomination of the candidate for the parliamentary approval is still made by the President, the Head of the State, formally, takes no part in the nominee's selection and there is an ambiguity whether the President may turn down the candidate suggested by the parliamentary coalition.

While the official nomination of the candidate for the parliamentary approval is still made by the President; as the Head of the State, formally, he takes no part in the nominee's selection and there is an ambiguity whether the President may turn down the candidate suggested by the parliamentary coalition.

-Before the constitutional reform adopted in late [[2004]] that took effect on January 1, 2006, the Prime Minister was nominated by the President and approved by the parliament. Subsequently, the rest of Cabinet was appointed by the President, formally upon the Prime Minister's nomination, although in practice the entire cabinet was often picked by the President himself.
-
-After the reform, the parliament has the authority to both nominate and approve the Prime Minister. The candidate is proposed by the parliamentary [[coalition]] to the President and the latter submits an official nomination back to [[Verkhovna Rada]] for a formal approval vote. While the official nomination of the candidate for the parliamentary approval is still made by the President; as the Head of the State, formally, he takes no part in the nominee's selection and there is an ambiguity whether the President may turn down the candidate suggested by the parliamentary coalition.
-
-The Prime Minister, following his appointment, nominates other members of the Cabinet (19 ministers) for approval by the Verkhovna Rada, except for the Minister of the Foreign Affairs and one of Defense, who are both nominated by the President.

At one point of time there also was an institute of ""state ministries"" that was majorly abolished on February 25, 1992 by the Presidential Decree (#98). There also is the Secretariat of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine that used to head by the Minister of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, but eventually lost the ministerial portfolio.

+News Top 25 OS X Terminal commands
+Top 25 OS X Terminal commands
+By Ian Osborne June 22, 2010Apple 
+Change settings and access hidden features on your Mac
+
+ 
+ 
+ 
+ SHARES 47
+Top 25 Terminal Tips
+
+Terminal (in Applications/ Utilities) gives you direct access to the UNIX system that underpins OS X. By typing specific commands into your Terminal window, you can make changes, open settings or access features that aren't available by any other means.
+
+After typing one of the commands offered in this tutorial, press Return to activate it, and anything offered in quotes is typed without the quote marks themselves.
+
+Commands split over two or more lines here should be typed in their entirety – you don't press Return halfway through. And bear in mind that some commands are case-sensitive, so be true to what's here.
+
+One final word of warning: all the tips in this article have been thoroughly tested, but experimenting with the Terminal is not a task to be undertaken lightly. Do not try to modify or adapt these hacks unless you really know what you're doing.
+
+01. i… Robot
+
+Your Mac can talk to you. Using a robotic voice reminiscent of a 50s sci-fi flick, it can ask after your health, tell you a joke or say anything else you care to type. It's a simple trick.
+
+Just open the Terminal application (found in Applications > Utilities), enter:
+
+
+say MacFormat
+
+…And the Terminal robot utters the name of MacFormat magazine. Obviously it doesn't have to be MacFormat – type anything you like. Give it a go, it's fun.
+
+02. Back up at will
+
+By default, Time Machine backups take place every hour, but you can change this through Terminal. To make it back up every half an hour instead, simply type:
+
+sudo defaults write /System/Library/Launch Daemons/com.apple.backupd-auto StartInterval -int 1800
+
+The '1800' at the end of this command is half an hour, expressed in seconds. You can change this figure to suit: for example, to back up once an hour again, replace it with '3600', for two-hour backups, '7200'.
+
+Always remember to be especially careful with commands that begin 'sudo'. These are system-level commands that can cause huge problems if misused, which is why you're asked for your administrator's password the first time you try one.
+
+03. Logon greetings
+
+Another sudo – and therefore dangerous – command that enables you to add a message to the login screen. In Terminal, type:
+
+sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText ""Your Message""
+
+Top 25 terminal tips logon message
+Replace 'Your Message' with whatever it is you want to display, of course, but be careful with your punctuation. Some characters (exclamation marks, for instance) stop the command from working.
+
+To remove the message, type:
+
+sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText """"
+
+04. Play games in the Terminal
+
+As you may know, OS X is UNIX based. Emacs, a text editor, forms part of the UNIX system, and it contains some Easter egg games, including the ever-popular Tetris, Pong and Snake.
+
+First you must find your Emacs version number. In the Terminal, type cd /usr/share/emacs/ And press Return. Now type 'ls' and press Return again. You're given your Emacs version number (1.21, for instance). Now, write it down.
+
+Then enter the following:
+
+ls /usr/share/emacs/[VERSION]/lisp/ play
+
+Replace [VERSION] with the number obtained earlier. You get a directory of all the available games. Make a note, or take a screenshot.
+
+Top 25 terminal tips pong
+Now switch to Emacs through Terminal by simply typing 'emacs'. To access the games, press Esc then x and type the name of the game you wish to play, before pressing Return.
+
+You can switch to the next game by pressing Esc then x and the name of the next game you wish to try. Have fun!
+
+05. Fix window sizes in FFView
+
+01. Resize problem 
+
+
+Top 25 terminal tips ffview 1
+
+FFView is a great sequential image viewer, but its Page width Mode resizes its window every time you turn to the next image. This is very annoying if you want to set – and stick to – your own window size. What to do?
+
+02. Resize resolution
+
+Top 25 terminal tips ffview 2
+Terminal solves the problem. Type:
+
+defaults write com.feedface.ffview udn_dont_resize_img_ win 1
+
+The window now remains a constant size. To reverse this, enter the code again, replacing the '1' at the end with '0'. Now restart the app.
+
+03. Want comics?
+
+Top 25 terminal tips ffview 3
+There's a wealth of downloadable free comics available on the web. For example, mobile comic publisher Robot Comics offers a list of high-quality, free-to-download material suitable for reading on your Mac with FFView. Check it out here.
+
+06. Get a massive Dock
+
+If you want giant-sized magnified Dock icons, enable Magnification in System Preferences > Dock, and in Terminal type:
+
+defaults write com.apple.dock largesize -int 512; killall Dock
+
+Top 25 terminal tips mssive dock
+This increases their maximum size to 512x512 pixels. You can substitute another figure if you wish, but don't go any higher than 512. To switch this effect off, just return to the Dock's preferences and move the Magnification slider back.
+
+07. Hybrid Dock folders
+
+For a different version of a Dock folder or Stack's List option, type:
+
+defaults write com.apple.dock use-new-liststack -boolean YES; killall Dock
+
+This gives you an interesting hybrid of the List and Grid viewing options. Your List view icons are bigger, and if there are more items than fits the window, you can scroll through them in the same way as you would in Grid view.
+
+Also like Grid view, clicking on a folder now opens it within the Stack. If you find you don't like these changes, type the command again, replacing 'YES' with 'NO'.
+
+08. Inspect the web
+
+Safari's Web Inspector offers a great deal of detail about web pages, and it's invaluable for serious web developers. You can activate it using Safari's Debug Menu outlined elsewhere in this tutorial, but if you only want the Web Inspector, type:
+
+defaults write com.apple.Safari WebKit DeveloperExtras -bool true
+
+After restarting Safari, you can now access the Web Inspector by right-clicking on a web page and selecting it from the contextual menu.
+
+As you might guess, you can deactivate this feature by repeating the command, but replacing 'true' with 'false' at the end and restarting Safari once more.
+
+09. Debug iCal
+
+Like many OS X applications, iCal has a Debug Mode that can be activated through Terminal. Type:
+
+defaults write com.apple.iCal IncludeDebugMenu YES
+
+A new menu bar pull-down titled Debug appears. You can hide it again by repeating the code but replacing 'YES' with 'NO'; note that iCal must be restarted for changes to take effect.
+
+10. Debug Address Book
+
+Address Book also has a hidden debug menu. To enable it, type:
+
+defaults write com.apple.addressbook ABShow DebugMenu -bool YES
+
+The Debug pull-down appears in the menu bar. To disable it again, repeat the command and replace 'YES' with 'NO' at the end. The application must be closed and restarted for these commands to take effect.
+
+11. Enable Safari debug menu
+
+To enable a debug menu in Safari 4, type; defaults write com.apple. safari IncludeInternalDebug Menu 1 Quit Safari and restart it for the hack to take effect, giving you an extra menu bar pulldown labelled Debug.
+
+Top 25 terminal tips safari debug menu
+To get rid of it again, repeat the command, replacing the '1' at the end with '0'. A restart is again required.
+
+12. Enable x-ray folders in Quick Look
+
+01. Folders can look dreary
+
+If you highlight a file in Finder and press [Space] or click on the eye-like icon in the toolbar, you activate Quick Look, giving you information about the item in question and possibly a preview of the file. Folders look pretty dull in Quick Look, as you can see here.
+
+02. See through the veil
+
+Fortunately, there is a way to spice up your folder viewing experience, and Terminal is the source: to make Quick Look give you an x-ray image of a folder, simply type:
+
+defaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableXRayFolders -boolean YES
+
+03. X-ray vision is yours
+
+Quick Look now offers an x-ray view of a folder, with an icon that shows you what's inside it. To disable this feature once more, type the code offered in step two again, replacing 'YES' with 'NO'. Quick Look folders are returned to their former state, with no x-ray view.
+
+13. Translucent icons 
+
+To turn the Dock icons translucent for applications that are open but hidden, type;
+
+defaults write com.apple. Dock showhidden -bool YES; killall Dock
+
+Translucent icons
+Repeat the command, replacing 'YES' with 'NO' to disable this feature once more. Icons for applications that are already hidden when you activate this feature will not appear translucent unless you Show and then Hide them again.
+
+14. Recently used
+
+This somewhat intimidating code introduces a new Stack into your Dock, showing a list of your recently used applications:
+
+defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-others -array-add '{ ""tile-data"" = { ""list-type"" = 1; }; ""tile-type"" = ""recents-tile""; }'; killall Dock
+
+Top 25 terminal tips recently used
+Type it carefully. It's a really useful feature. When the new Stack is in your Dock, you can right-click on it and change it from showing Recent Applications to Recent Documents, Recent Servers, Favourite Volumes or Favourite Items.
+
+It can be displayed in Fan, Grid or List View, just like a regular stack. If you want to get rid of it again, just drag it out of the Dock.
+
+15. Expose your Dock
+
+By default, clicking and holding on the Dock icon for an active application in Snow Leopard activates Dashboard Exposé, showing all of that application's currently-open windows. In Leopard, of course, this gave you a contextual menu; that's something you can access in both operating systems by right-clicking on the icon in question.
+
+If you're running Snow Leopard but prefer Leopard's way of doing things, type the following Terminal command:
+
+defaults write com.apple.dock show-exposemenus -boolean no; killall Dock
+
+Repeating the command with 'YES' instead of 'NO' returns your Dock's Exposé functions to normal.
+
+16. Grid view highlights
+
+If you open a Stack in Grid view, you can navigate through its enclosures using your keyboard's arrow keys, with the currently selected icon highlighted by a grey gradient box. However, if you drag your mouse pointer over the Grid, no such highlighting appears – unless you use this Terminal command:
+
+defaults write com.apple.dock mouse-over-hilitestack -boolean YES; killall Dock
+
+You now get the same grey background box during mouse-overs as you do when navigating through the Grid using the keyboard. Replace 'YES' with 'NO' to switch this off again, though we doubt you'll want to.
+
+17. Dock the gloss
+
+If you're not too keen on the 3D Dock, with its shiny glass finish showing reflections of the application icons, use this tip to switch to something a little simpler:
+
+defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES; killall Dock
+
+Your Dock background is now a much plainer translucent black design with a thin white outline. Icons are no longer reflected in the Dock, and open applications are indicated by a white dot instead of a blue floodlight.
+
+If you decide you prefer the 3D look after all you can repeat the command substituting 'NO' for 'YES', so you've nothing to lose by giving it a go.
+
+18. Search your music
+
+When you highlight a track in your iTunes library, you get a right-facing arrow in a circle. Clicking on this searches the iTunes Store for similar material. However, using this Terminal input, you can get it to search your library instead:
+
+defaults write com.apple.iTunes invertStore Links -bool YES
+
+Restart iTunes to activate it, and repeat the command with 'NO' replacing 'YES' to switch things back to their default behaviour.
+
+19. Drag Dashboard widgets onto your Desktop
+
+One of the most interesting Terminal tips enables you to drag your widgets out of the Dashboard and onto the Desktop, where they float above open applications and Finder windows akin to the 'Gadgets' in Windows Vista's Sidebar. To activate it, type:
+
+defaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES

-12. Enable x-ray folders in Quick Look
-
-01. Folders can look dreary
-
-If you highlight a file in Finder and press [Space] or click on the eye-like icon in the toolbar, you activate Quick Look, giving you information about the item in question and possibly a preview of the file. Folders look pretty dull in Quick Look, as you can see here.
-
-02. See through the veil
-
-Fortunately, there is a way to spice up your folder viewing experience, and Terminal is the source: to make Quick Look give you an x-ray image of a folder, simply type:
-
-defaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableXRayFolders -boolean YES
-
-03. X-ray vision is yours
-
-Quick Look now offers an x-ray view of a folder, with an icon that shows you what's inside it. To disable this feature once more, type the code offered in step two again, replacing 'YES' with 'NO'. Quick Look folders are returned to their former state, with no x-ray view.
-
-13. Translucent icons 
-
-To turn the Dock icons translucent for applications that are open but hidden, type;
-
-defaults write com.apple. Dock showhidden -bool YES; killall Dock
-
-Translucent icons
-Repeat the command, replacing 'YES' with 'NO' to disable this feature once more. Icons for applications that are already hidden when you activate this feature will not appear translucent unless you Show and then Hide them again.
-
-14. Recently used
-
-This somewhat intimidating code introduces a new Stack into your Dock, showing a list of your recently used applications:
-
-defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-others -array-add '{ ""tile-data"" = { ""list-type"" = 1; }; ""tile-type"" = ""recents-tile""; }'; killall Dock
-
-Top 25 terminal tips recently used
-Type it carefully. It's a really useful feature. When the new Stack is in your Dock, you can right-click on it and change it from showing Recent Applications to Recent Documents, Recent Servers, Favourite Volumes or Favourite Items.
-
-It can be displayed in Fan, Grid or List View, just like a regular stack. If you want to get rid of it again, just drag it out of the Dock.
-
-15. Expose your Dock
-
-By default, clicking and holding on the Dock icon for an active application in Snow Leopard activates Dashboard Exposé, showing all of that application's currently-open windows. In Leopard, of course, this gave you a contextual menu; that's something you can access in both operating systems by right-clicking on the icon in question.
-
-If you're running Snow Leopard but prefer Leopard's way of doing things, type the following Terminal command:
-
-defaults write com.apple.dock show-exposemenus -boolean no; killall Dock
-
-Repeating the command with 'YES' instead of 'NO' returns your Dock's Exposé functions to normal.
-
-16. Grid view highlights
-
-If you open a Stack in Grid view, you can navigate through its enclosures using your keyboard's arrow keys, with the currently selected icon highlighted by a grey gradient box. However, if you drag your mouse pointer over the Grid, no such highlighting appears – unless you use this Terminal command:
-
-defaults write com.apple.dock mouse-over-hilitestack -boolean YES; killall Dock
-
-You now get the same grey background box during mouse-overs as you do when navigating through the Grid using the keyboard. Replace 'YES' with 'NO' to switch this off again, though we doubt you'll want to.
-
-17. Dock the gloss
-
-If you're not too keen on the 3D Dock, with its shiny glass finish showing reflections of the application icons, use this tip to switch to something a little simpler:
-
-defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES; killall Dock
-
-Your Dock background is now a much plainer translucent black design with a thin white outline. Icons are no longer reflected in the Dock, and open applications are indicated by a white dot instead of a blue floodlight.
-
-If you decide you prefer the 3D look after all you can repeat the command substituting 'NO' for 'YES', so you've nothing to lose by giving it a go.
-
-18. Search your music
-
-When you highlight a track in your iTunes library, you get a right-facing arrow in a circle. Clicking on this searches the iTunes Store for similar material. However, using this Terminal input, you can get it to search your library instead:
-
-defaults write com.apple.iTunes invertStore Links -bool YES
-
-Restart iTunes to activate it, and repeat the command with 'NO' replacing 'YES' to switch things back to their default behaviour.
-
-19. Drag Dashboard widgets onto your Desktop
-
-One of the most interesting Terminal tips enables you to drag your widgets out of the Dashboard and onto the Desktop, where they float above open applications and Finder windows akin to the 'Gadgets' in Windows Vista's Sidebar. To activate it, type:
-
-defaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES

 ==Scope==
 The number of ministries in the cabinet has changed over time, some ministries were abolished, others combined with others or degraded to state committees or agencies. Each ministry is in charge of other government sub-departments. There are three basic types of government sub-departments known as ""central offices (organs) of executive authority"": services, agencies, inspections. Beside the basic government sub-departments there also other government sub-departments which were granted a special status. Among such sub-departments there are various government committees, government commissions, government funds, and other institutions. Sub-departments may be elevated to ministerial status by their reorganization and, vice-versa, government ministries may degraded to sub-departments (e.g. Ministry of Emergencies was degraded to a sub-department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs).","The current Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine is [[Honcharuk Government]] that was formed on 29 August 2019, led by [[Oleksiy Honcharuk]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-s-new-parliament-has-action-packed-agenda-for-first-session/30134531.html|title=Ukrainian Lawmakers Approve Political Novice Honcharuk As Prime Minister|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>",Yulia Romero,2019-08-29T20:09:21Z,"Changed the description of the current Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine from ""Groysman government"" to ""Honcharuk Government"" and added details about its formation and leadership.

-The number of ministries in the cabinet has changed over time, some ministries were abolished, others combined with others or degraded to state committees or agencies. Each ministry is in charge of other government sub-departments.

Beside the basic government sub-departments there also other government sub-departments which were granted a special status. Among such sub-departments there are various government committees, government commissions, government funds, and other institutions. Sub-departments may be elevated to ministerial status by their reorganization and, vice-versa, government ministries may degraded to sub-departments (e.g. Ministry of Emergencies was degraded to a sub-department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs).

 The number of ministries in the cabinet has changed over time, some ministries were abolished, others combined with others or degraded to state committees or agencies. Each ministry is in charge of other government sub-departments. There are three basic types of government sub-departments known as ""central offices (organs) of executive authority"": services, agencies, inspections. Beside the basic government sub-departments there also other government sub-departments which were granted a special status. Among such sub-departments there are various government committees, government commissions, government funds, and other institutions. Sub-departments may be elevated to ministerial status by their reorganization and, vice versa, government ministries may degraded to sub-departments (e.g. Ministry of Emergencies was degraded to a sub-department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs).","The current Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine is the [[Shmyhal Government]] that was formed on 4 March 2020, led by [[Denys Shmyhal]].<ref name=""btkpBermetHasty"">{{cite news |last1=Talant |first1=Bermet |title=Hasty government reshuffle sows disquiet at home, abroad |publisher=Kyiv Post |date=6 March 2020 |url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/hasty-government-reshuffle-sows-disquiet-at-home-abroad.html}}</ref>",Yulia Romero,2020-03-25T16:51:03Z,"Changed the reference to the current Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine from the ""Honcharuk Government"" to the ""Shmyhal Government,"" updating the formation date and leader.

 ==Scope==
 The number of ministries in the cabinet has changed over time, some ministries were abolished, others combined with others or degraded to state committees or agencies. Each ministry is in charge of other government sub-departments. There are three basic types of government sub-departments known as ""central offices (organs) of executive authority"": services, agencies, inspections. Beside the basic government sub-departments there also other government sub-departments which were granted a special status. Among such sub-departments there are various government committees, government commissions, government funds, and other institutions. Sub-departments may be elevated to ministerial status by their reorganization and, vice versa, government ministries may degraded to sub-departments (e.g. Ministry of Emergencies was degraded to a sub-department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs).",Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/178.133.80.194|178.133.80.194]] ([[User talk:178.133.80.194|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.10),Materialscientist,2020-11-10T14:20:40Z,"The change made in this revision involved the addition of an infobox for the ""Government of Ukraine,"" which includes details such as the government name, image, formation date, and other relevant information.

 ==Scope==
 The number of ministries in the cabinet has changed over time, some ministries were abolished, others combined with others or degraded to state committees or agencies. Each ministry is in charge of other government sub-departments. There are three basic types of government sub-departments known as ""central offices (organs) of executive authority"": services, agencies, inspections. Beside the basic government sub-departments there also other government sub-departments which were granted a special status. Among such sub-departments there are various government committees, government commissions, government funds, and other institutions. Sub-departments may be elevated to ministerial status by their reorganization and, vice versa, government ministries may degraded to sub-departments (e.g. Ministry of Emergencies was degraded to a sub-department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs).

+==Scope==
+The number of ministries in the cabinet has changed over time, some ministries were abolished, others combined with others or degraded to state committees or agencies. Each ministry is in charge of other government sub-departments. There are three basic types of government sub-departments known as ""central offices (organs) of executive authority"": services, agencies, inspections. Beside the basic government sub-departments there also other government sub-departments which were granted a special status. Among such sub-departments there are various government committees, government commissions, government funds, and other institutions. Sub-departments may be elevated to ministerial status by their reorganization and, vice versa, government ministries may degraded to sub-departments (e.g. Ministry of Emergencies was degraded to a sub-department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs).
+
+The Cabinet is responsible to the [[President of Ukraine]] and is under the control of, and is held accountable to, the ''[[Verkhovna Rada]]'' (Ukrainian parliament).

The prime minister presides over the cabinet. Some vice prime ministers may be appointed as the first vice prime ministers.

 ==Scope==
 The number of ministries in the cabinet has changed over time, some ministries were abolished, others combined with others or degraded to state committees or agencies. Each ministry is in charge of other government sub-departments. There are three basic types of government sub-departments known as ""central offices (organs) of executive authority"": services, agencies, inspections. Beside the basic government sub-departments there also other government sub-departments which were granted a special status. Among such sub-departments there are various government committees, government commissions, government funds, and other institutions. Sub-departments may be elevated to ministerial status by their reorganization and, vice versa, government ministries may degraded to sub-departments (e.g. Ministry of Emergencies was degraded to a sub-department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs).

 The cabinet is a collegiate body consisting of the cabinet's ""presidium"" composed of the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] and their vice prime ministers as well as other ministers who participate and vote on sessions of the cabinet. The prime minister presides over the cabinet. Some vice prime ministers may be appointed as the first vice prime ministers. Unlike the Soviet period of the government when presidium was actually a functioning institution, the current government presidium is nominal and vice prime ministers do not have much advantage over other ministers. All government decisions are being voted for and adopted at the sessions of the cabinet by ministers only or heads of central offices of executive authority with ministerial status. The [[Secretariat of Cabinet of Ministers (Ukraine)|Secretariat of Cabinet of Ministers]] ensures the operations of the cabinet, while the [[National Agency of Ukraine for Civil Service]] provides human resources of government officials.

 The basic unit of government administration in Ukraine is a central office of executive authority (central executive office) which may be granted ministerial status. Each such central office of executive authority is chaired by its head (''holova''). Many central offices of executive authority without ministerial status may be part of a government ministry, while others function separately or support either the [[President of Ukraine]] or the ''[[Verkhovna Rada]]'' (parliament). Central offices of executive authority without ministerial status are designated either as services, agencies, or inspections. Selected central offices of executive authority are granted a ""special status"". Only very few central executive offices are designated as funds, committees or otherwise.
