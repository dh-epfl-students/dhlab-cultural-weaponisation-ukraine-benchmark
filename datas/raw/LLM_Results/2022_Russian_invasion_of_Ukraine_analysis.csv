-By 20 March, the Russian military appeared to be waging a rapid invasion to achieve its apparent primary goal of the seizure of Kyiv, along with the occupation of Eastern Ukraine and the displacement of the Ukrainian government. Russian forces quickly became stalled while approaching Kyiv due to several factors, including the disparity in morale and performance between Ukrainian and Russian forces, the Ukrainian use of sophisticated man-portable weapons provided by Western allies, poor Russian logistics and equipment performance, the failure of the Russian Air Force to achieve air superiority, and Russian military attrition during their siege of major cities.<ref name=""wapo20220320""/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/21/ukraine-is-winning-war-russia-offensive-putin/ |title=Opinion: Against all odds, Ukrainians are winning.

Russian forces quickly became stalled while approaching Kyiv due to several factors, including the disparity in morale and performance between Ukrainian and Russian forces, the Ukrainian use of sophisticated man-portable weapons provided by Western allies, poor Russian logistics and equipment performance, the failure of the Russian Air Force to achieve air superiority, and Russian military attrition during their siege of major cities.<ref name=""wapo20220320""/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/21/ukraine-is-winning-war-russia-offensive-putin/ |title=Opinion: Against all odds, Ukrainians are winning.

+{{Further|Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts}}
+Russia abandoned the [[northern Ukraine campaign|attempt to take Kyiv]] in early April, but a lasting state of war between Russia and Ukraine remained, with Russia successfully capturing [[Mariupol]] by 20 May 2022,<ref name=""531Azovstal"">{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-says-remaining-531-azovstal-192141701.html|title=Russia says remaining 531 Azovstal defenders surrender, steelworks siege over|date=20 May 2022}}</ref> and maintaining an occupation of large portions of four [[Ukrainian oblasts]]—[[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]], [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]], [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]], and [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast|Zaporizhzhia]]. In August, Ukrainian forces began liberating territories in the [[2022 Ukrainian eastern counteroffensive|north-east]] and [[2022 Ukrainian southern counteroffensive|south]]. 
+
+On 30 September 2022, [[Russia]] declared the [[Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts|annexation]] of the four partially-occupied oblasts, which was [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/4|internationally condemned]]. Most of Luhansk Oblast and part of Donetsk Oblast had been controlled by [[Russian separatist forces in Ukraine|pro-Russian separatists]] since 2014, while the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were invaded by Russia in 2022. The boundaries of the areas to be annexed and their borders were not defined; Russian officials stated that they would be defined later. None of the oblasts were fully under Russian control at the time of the declaration, nor since. If limited to the areas then under Russian control (about 90,000 km<sup>2</sup> or 15% of [[Ukraine]]'s territory, roughly the size of [[Portugal]]) the annexation would still be the largest in Europe since [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dickson |first=Janice |date=30 September 2022 |title=Putin signs documents to illegally annex four Ukrainian regions, in drastic escalation of Russia's war |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-putin-signs-documents-to-unlawfully-claim-4-ukrainian-regions-in/ |url-status=live |access-date=1 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221001031159/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-putin-signs-documents-to-unlawfully-claim-4-ukrainian-regions-in/ |archive-date=1 October 2022|quote=Mr. Putin’s claim to more than 15 per cent of Ukraine’s territory is the largest annexation in Europe since the Second World War.}}</ref>
