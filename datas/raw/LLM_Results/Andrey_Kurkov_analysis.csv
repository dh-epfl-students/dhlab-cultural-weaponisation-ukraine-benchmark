-As a trained Japanese translator Kurkov was assigned military service assisting the [[KGB]].  However, he managed to get his papers changed to service with the military police.  This offered him a greater degree of freedom during and after his service period.  He was assigned a prison guard position in [[Odessa]].  It was during this period that Kurkov managed to write all of his children's stories.

-Kurkov's first [[novel]] was published two weeks before the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and in the ensuing social and political turmoil he made the first steps towards self-publishing and distribution.  Borrowing money from friends to fund his work he managed to publish around 75,000 books independently.  Whilst organising distribution around [[Ukraine]], he would also man stalls on busy streets to sell copies by hand.

 ==Bibliography==
 Novels:","added Russian name, minor fixes",Languagehat,2009-03-23T19:45:52Z,"**Change Description:** Added the full Russian name ""Andrey Yurevich Kurkov"" and made minor grammatical fixes.

**Analysis:** The addition of the full Russian name may serve to emphasize Kurkov's Russian heritage, which could be interpreted as an attempt to align him more closely with Russian cultural identity. This could be seen as a subtle shift in narrative that may resonate with perspectives that prioritize Russian identity over Ukrainian, especially in the context of the ongoing cultural tensions between Ukraine and Russia.

**Conclusion:** Weaponised. The change subtly reinforces a narrative that could be used to frame Kurkov's identity in a way that aligns with Russian cultural heritage, potentially undermining his Ukrainian identity.",Weaponised

**Weaponised**: The inclusion of ""and Ukrainian"" emphasizes the dual linguistic identity of Kurkov, which can be seen as a response to narratives surrounding language use in Ukraine amidst the ongoing conflict. This shift may serve to highlight the cultural resilience and identity of Ukrainian writers, potentially countering narratives that suggest a suppression of Ukrainian culture.",Weaponised

He also produced poetry about [[Lenin]], purportedly inspired by his [[Soviet education]] at the time.

 His first novel was published two weeks before the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], and in the ensuing social and political turmoil he made the first steps towards [[self-publishing]] and distribution. Borrowing money from friends to fund his work, Kurkov managed to publish independently.<ref name=wroe/> While organising distribution around [[Ukraine]], he would also sell copies by hand from stalls on busy streets.
 
 Like many successful writers, Kurkov had difficulty getting his first publishing contract. He reportedly received 500 rejections before being accepted, in which time he had written almost eight complete novels.
