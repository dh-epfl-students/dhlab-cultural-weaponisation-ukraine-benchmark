 Faced by many enemies on all sides the UNR's army was organised to face each threat. To the North-east were the [[Bolsheviks]], to the south-east were the [[White movement|Russian Whites]], to the south-west [[Rumanians]] who had claims on territory there, and the [[France|French]] intervention force took [[Odessa]] in December 1918 to fill the power vacuum left by the withdrawing Austrians and Germans.
 Coming quickly to terms with the French and the Rumanians, the UNR's army was able to employ more men on other fronts.
 
-With major fighting breaking out in January 1919, the Ukrainians were pushed back and Kiev fell in February 1919. By May, the Directory's armies had been squeezed into a narrow strip of land around [[Brody]]. They then negotiated with the [[Poles]], who were attacking the Ukrainians from behind, with this ceasefire, the Ukrainians were able to counter-attack and re-take [[Podilia]] and established a new capital in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]].

But for all this, Red counter attacks and a deadly typhus epidemic caused the Ukrainian's to be pushed out of Ukrainian territory completely into Polish lands.
 
 In 1920, the Poles helped form two new Ukrainian divisions and joined with each other after the defeat of Denikin. A UNR-Polish Treaty in April 1920 provided for combined operations between the two armies under overall Polish command. In the [[Polish-Soviet War in 1920|Soviet-Polish war of 1920]], the Poles and Ukrainians advanced side by side, and the UNR was set up again when they re-took Kiev. But a Summer counter-offensive left the Poles and Ukrainians retreating, an armistice was signed in late 1920. With this great disappointment, the UNR forces launched an attack on their own against the Reds from Polish territory, however this was quickly beaten. They were forced back into Galicia, which became part of Polish territory in the [[Treaty of Riga]].

 In 1920, the Poles helped form two new Ukrainian divisions and joined with each other after the defeat of Denikin. A UNR-Polish Treaty in April 1920 provided for combined operations between the two armies under overall Polish command. In the [[Polish-Soviet War in 1920|Soviet-Polish war of 1920]], the Poles and Ukrainians advanced side by side, and the UNR was set up again when they re-took Kiev. But a Summer counter-offensive left the Poles and Ukrainians retreating, an armistice was signed in late 1920. With this great disappointment, the UNR forces launched an attack on their own against the Reds from Polish territory, however this was quickly beaten. They were forced back into Galicia, which became part of Polish territory in the [[Treaty of Riga]].

 With the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], Skoropadsky could no longer rely on [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]'s support. In November 1918, Skoropadky's opponents set up a rival body known as the Directory, whose forces were headed by the newly reformed [[Sich Rifles]]. Most of Skoropadsky's troops joined with the Directory. Skoropadsky turned to many White Russian officers on their way to fight alongside [[Denikin]], forming them into a Special Corps, but these troops could not face the Directory troops. In December 1918, the Directory troops took [[Kiev]] and overthrew Skoropadsky's regime.",update,Aleksandr Grigoryev,2009-11-22T23:08:55Z,"Changed the text by adding a space after ""SR-"" in ""SR-centrist"" to ""SR-centrists"".

 ==History==
-With the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], Skoropadsky could no longer rely on [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]'s support. On November 13, 1918 Skoropadky's opponents set up a rival body known as the Directory, whose forces were headed by the newly reformed [[Sich Rifles]]. Most of Skoropadsky's troops joined with the Directory. Skoropadsky turned to many White Russian officers on their way to fight alongside [[Denikin]], forming them into a Special Corps, but these troops could not face the Directory troops. On December 19, 1918, the Directory troops took [[Kiev]] and overthrew Skoropadsky's regime.

-The Directory re-established the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR). The new regime was torn between the pro-nationalistic, including the party of peasant-democrats, and the factions for the federal union with Russia. At the end the idea to reestablish the [[Central Rada]] was set aside as well as to recover all its legal acts. On December 26, 1918 the Directory released its declaration to eliminate the Hetman regime.

-Faced by many enemies on all sides the UNR's army was organised to face each threat. To the North-east were the [[Bolsheviks]], to the south-east were the [[White movement|Russian Whites]], to the south-west [[Romania]]ns who had claims on territory there, and the [[France|French]] intervention force took [[Odessa]] in December 1918 to fill the power vacuum left by the withdrawing Austrians and Germans.

 With the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], Skoropadsky could no longer rely on [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]'s support.

Most of Skoropadsky's troops joined with the Directory during a month long the Ukrainian Civil War. Skoropadsky then turned to some of the Russian officers who were fighting alongside [[Denikin]], forming them into a Special Corps, but these troops were not able to face the Directory troops.

 Faced by many enemies on all sides the UNR's army was organised to face each threat. To the North-east were the [[Bolsheviks]], to the south-east were the [[White movement|Russian Whites]], to the south-west [[Romania]]ns who had claims on territory in [[Bucovina]] and [[Halychyna]], and the [[France|French]] intervention force took [[Odessa]] in December 1918 to fill the power vacuum left by the withdrawing Austrians and Germans. Coming quickly to some understanding with the French and the Romanians, the UNR's army was able to employ more men on other fronts.
 
 ===Change of powers 1919-1920===
+{{seealso|Ukrainian–Soviet War}}
 With major fighting breaking out in January 1919, the Ukrainians were pushed back and Kiev fell in February 1919. The government moved to [[Vinnytsia]] on [[February 5]], 1919. A political trick took place that the Directory tried to play with [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko]] resignation to demonstrate a change of powers in the Ukrainian government and maybe attain a possible acceptance with the Entante. [[Symon Petliura]] has left the party and replaced the Vynnychenko's position who was too well known. Petliura has assumed the position of the Directory's chairman on [[February 11]], 1919, a week after the government moved to [[Podolie|Podillia]]. The talks, alias, were proved to be without results. By May of 1919, the Directory's armies had been squeezed into a narrow strip of land around [[Brody]]. Soviets then negotiated with the [[Poles]], who were attacking the Ukrainians from behind, with this ceasefire, the Ukrainians were able to counter-attack and re-take [[Podilia]] and established a new capital in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]]. In June, the UNR's forces were joined by the [[Western Ukrainian Republic]]'s forces, who had been pushed out of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] by the Poles.  During that time (May of 1919), General [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and his white army launched an offensive against the Reds, during the summer and autumn of that year. The ''White Guards'' forces pushed the Reds out of the Central and Eastern Ukraine, thus, given the Directory another chance to reclaim [[Kyiv]]. But the constant ''Red Guards'' counter-attacks and a deadly typhus epidemic caused the Petliura forces to be pushed out of Ukraine completely into the well established territory of Poland. A political crisis took place inside the Directory members of which were heavily interfered in the affairs of the Council of People's Ministers. Because of that Shvets and Makarenko were sent on the state matters abroad. Later in May of 1920 on the request of Petliura to return they did not reply and were dismissed.
 
 In 1920, the Polish Army reorganized with the help from the two new Ukrainian divisions to prepare an offensive against the Denikin's forces. A [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|UNR-Polish Treaty]] in April 1920 provided for combined operations between the two armies under overall Polish command while recognizing the Polish sovereignty over the territory of the former [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] with the border passing along the [[Zbruch river]]. In the [[Polish-Soviet War in 1920|Soviet-Polish war of 1920]], the Poles and Ukrainians advanced side by side, and the UNR was set up again when they re-took Kiev. But less than a month later the Soviet's summer counter-offensive left the Poles and Ukrainians retreating, an armistice was signed in late 1920. With this great disappointment, the UNR forces launched an attack on their own against the Reds from Polish territory, however that was quickly beaten. They were forced back into Galicia. In 1920 Poland concluded a border dispute by the [[Treaty of Riga]] with the Soviet Union, thus, canceling the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)]].",/* Change of powers 1919-1920 */ update,Aleksandr Grigoryev,2010-02-12T01:59:41Z,"Added a reference to the ""Ukrainian–Soviet War"" with the inclusion of the line ""{{seealso|Ukrainian–Soviet War}}"".

 With the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], Skoropadsky could no longer rely on [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]'s support. On November 13, 1918 Skoropadky's opponents set up a rival body known as the Directory, whose forces were headed by the newly reformed [[Sich Rifles]]. Most of Skoropadsky's troops joined with the Directory during a month long the Ukrainian Civil War. Skoropadsky then turned to some of the Russian officers who were fighting alongside [[Denikin]], forming them into a Special Corps, but these troops were not able to face the Directory troops. On December 19, 1918, the Directory troops took [[Kiev]] and overthrew Skoropadsky's regime.
 
 The Directory re-established the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR). The new regime was torn between the pro-nationalistic, including the party of peasant-democrats, and the factions for the federal union with Russia. At the end the idea to reestablish the [[Central Rada]] was set aside as well as to recover all its legal acts yet the most important one were preserved. On December 26, 1918 the Directory released its declaration to eliminate the Hetman regime.",/* Post-Hetmanate recovery */ update,Aleksandr Grigoryev,2010-02-14T00:35:02Z,"Change: Changed the section header from ""Post-Hetmanate recovery"" to ""===Post-Hetmanate recovery==="" (increased header level).

 With the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], Skoropadsky could no longer rely on [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]'s support. On November 13, 1918 Skoropadky's opponents set up a rival body known as the Directory, whose forces were headed by the newly reformed [[Sich Rifles]]. Most of Skoropadsky's troops joined with the Directory during a month long the Ukrainian Civil War. Skoropadsky then turned to some of the Russian officers who were fighting alongside [[Denikin]], forming them into a Special Corps, but these troops were not able to face the Directory troops. On December 19, 1918, the Directory troops took [[Kiev]] and overthrew Skoropadsky's regime.
 
 The Directory re-established the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR). The new regime was torn between the pro-nationalistic, including the party of peasant-democrats, and the factions for the federal union with Russia. At the end the idea to reestablish the [[Central Rada]] was set aside as well as to recover all its legal acts yet the most important one were preserved.

 The Directory re-established the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR).  The new regime was torn between the pro-nationalistic, including the party of peasant-democrats, and the factions for the federal union with Russia. At the end the idea to reestablish the [[Central Rada]] was set aside as well as to recover all its legal acts yet the most important one were preserved. On December 26, 1918 the Directory released its declaration to eliminate the Hetman regime.

+By the end of 1918 the Directory began to be dominated by the Ukrainian military leader, [[Symon Petliura]].
 
 Faced by many enemies on all sides the UNR's army was organised to face each threat. To the North-east were the [[Bolsheviks]], to the south-east were the [[White movement|Russian Whites]], to the south-west [[Romania]]ns who had claims on territory in [[Bucovina]] and [[Halychyna]], and the [[France|French]] intervention force took [[Odessa]] in December 1918 to fill the power vacuum left by the withdrawing Austrians and Germans. Coming quickly to some understanding with the French and the Romanians, the UNR's army was able to employ more men on other fronts.

-With major fighting breaking out in January 1919, the Ukrainians were pushed back and Kiev fell in February 1919. The government moved to [[Vinnytsia]] on [[February 5]], 1919. A political trick took place that the Directory tried to play with [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko]] resignation to demonstrate a change of powers in the Ukrainian government and maybe attain a possible acceptance with the Entante. [[Symon Petliura]] has left the party and replaced the Vynnychenko's position who was too well known. Petliura has assumed the position of the Directory's chairman on [[February 11]], 1919, a week after the government moved to [[Podolie|Podillia]]. The talks, alias, were proved to be without results. By May of 1919, the Directory's armies had been squeezed into a narrow strip of land around [[Brody]]. Soviets then negotiated with the [[Poles]], who were attacking the Ukrainians from behind, with this ceasefire, the Ukrainians were able to counter-attack and re-take [[Podilia]] and established a new capital in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]]. In June, the UNR's forces were joined by the [[Western Ukrainian Republic]]'s forces, who had been pushed out of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] by the Poles.  During that time (May of 1919), General [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and his white army launched an offensive against the Reds, during the summer and autumn of that year. The ''White Guards'' forces pushed the Reds out of the Central and Eastern Ukraine, thus, given the Directory another chance to reclaim [[Kiev]]. But the constant ''Red Guards'' counter-attacks and a deadly typhus epidemic caused the Petliura forces to be pushed out of Ukraine completely into the well established territory of Poland. A political crisis took place inside the Directory members of which were heavily interfered in the affairs of the Council of People's Ministers. Because of that Shvets and Makarenko were sent on the state matters abroad. Later in May of 1920 on the request of Petliura to return they did not reply and were dismissed.

 In 1920, the Polish Army reorganized with the help from the two new Ukrainian divisions to prepare an offensive against the Denikin's forces. A [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|UNR-Polish Treaty]] in April 1920 provided for combined operations between the two armies under overall Polish command while recognizing the Polish sovereignty over the territory of the former [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] with the border passing along the [[Zbruch river]]. In the [[Polish-Soviet War in 1920|Soviet-Polish war of 1920]], the Poles and Ukrainians advanced side by side, and the UNR was set up again when they re-took Kiev. But less than a month later the Soviet's summer counter-offensive left the Poles and Ukrainians retreating, an armistice was signed in late 1920. With this great disappointment, the UNR forces launched an attack on their own against the Reds from Polish territory, however that was quickly beaten. They were forced back into Galicia. In 1920 Poland concluded a border dispute by the [[Treaty of Riga]] with the Soviet Union, thus, canceling the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)]].

On December 19, 1918, the Directory troops took [[Kiev]] and overthrew Skoropadsky's regime.
 
 The Directory re-established the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR).  The new regime was torn between the pro-nationalistic, including the party of peasant-democrats, and the factions for the federal union with Russia. At the end the idea to reestablish the [[Central Rada]] was set aside as well as to recover all its legal acts yet the most important one were preserved. On December 26, 1918 the Directory released its declaration to eliminate the Hetman regime.
 
 By the end of 1918 the Directory began to be dominated by the Ukrainian military leader, [[Symon Petliura]].
 
-Faced by many enemies on all sides the UNR's army was organised to face each threat. To the North-east were the [[Bolsheviks]], to the south-east were the [[White movement|Russian Whites]], to the south-west [[Romania]]ns who had claims on territory in [[Bucovina]] and [[Halychyna]], and the [[France|French]] intervention force took [[Odessa]] in December 1918 to fill the power vacuum left by the withdrawing Austrians and Germans. Coming quickly to some understanding with the French and the Romanians, the UNR's army was able to employ more men on other fronts.

 ===Change of powers 1919-1920===
-{{seealso|Ukrainian–Soviet War}}
-With major fighting breaking out in January 1919, the Ukrainians were pushed back and Kiev fell in February 1919. The government moved to [[Vinnytsia]] on [[February 5]], 1919. A political trick took place that the Directory tried to play with [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko]] resignation to demonstrate a change of powers in the Ukrainian government and maybe attain a possible acceptance with the Entante. [[Symon Petliura]] has left the party and replaced the Vynnychenko's position who was too well known. Petliura has assumed the position of the Directory's chairman on [[February 11]], 1919, a week after the government moved to [[Podolie|Podillia]]. The talks, alias, were proved to be without results. By May 1919, the Directory's armies had been squeezed into a narrow strip of land around [[Brody]]. Soviets then negotiated with the [[Poles]], who were attacking the Ukrainians from behind, with this ceasefire, the Ukrainians were able to counter-attack and re-take [[Podilia]] and established a new capital in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]]. In June, the UNR's forces were joined by the [[Western Ukrainian Republic]]'s forces, who had been pushed out of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] by the Poles.  During that time (May 1919), General [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and his white army launched an offensive against the Reds, during the summer and autumn of that year. The ''White Guards'' forces pushed the Reds out of the Central and Eastern Ukraine, thus, given the Directory another chance to reclaim [[Kiev]]. But the constant ''Red Guards'' counter-attacks and a deadly typhus epidemic caused the Petliura forces to be pushed out of Ukraine completely into the well established territory of Poland. A political crisis took place inside the Directory members of which were heavily interfered in the affairs of the Council of People's Ministers. Because of that Shvets and Makarenko were sent on the state matters abroad. Later in May 1920 on the request of Petliura to return they did not reply and were dismissed.

By May 1919, the Directory's armies had been squeezed into a narrow strip of land around [[Brody]]. Soviets then negotiated with the [[Poles]], who were attacking the Ukrainians from behind, with this ceasefire, the Ukrainians were able to counter-attack and re-take [[Podilia]] and established a new capital in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]]. In June, the UNR's forces were joined by the [[Western Ukrainian Republic]]'s forces, who had been pushed out of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] by the Poles.  During that time (May 1919), General [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and his white army launched an offensive against the Reds, during the summer and autumn of that year. The ''White Guards'' forces pushed the Reds out of the Central and Eastern Ukraine, thus, given the Directory another chance to reclaim [[Kiev]]. But the constant ''Red Guards'' counter-attacks and a deadly typhus epidemic caused the Petliura forces to be pushed out of Ukraine completely into the well established territory of Poland. A political crisis took place inside the Directory members of which were heavily interfered in the affairs of the Council of People's Ministers. Because of that Shvets and Makarenko were sent on the state matters abroad. Later in May 1920 on the request of Petliura to return they did not reply and were dismissed.
 
 In 1920, the Polish Army reorganized with the help from the two new Ukrainian divisions to prepare an offensive against the Denikin's forces.

 With the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in World War I, Skoropadsky could no longer rely on Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]]'s support. On November 13, 1918 Skoropadky's opponents set up a rival body known as the Directory, whose forces were headed by the newly reformed [[Sich Rifles]]. Most of Skoropadsky's troops joined with the Directory during a month long the Ukrainian Civil War. Skoropadsky then turned to some of the Russian officers who were fighting alongside [[Denikin]], forming them into a Special Corps, but these troops were not able to face the Directory troops.  On December 19, 1918, the Directory troops took [[Kiev]] and overthrew Skoropadsky's regime.

 With major fighting breaking out in January 1919, the Ukrainians were pushed back and Kiev fell in February 1919. The government moved to [[Vinnytsia]] on February 5, 1919. A political trick took place that the Directory tried to play with [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko]] resignation to demonstrate a change of powers in the Ukrainian government and maybe attain a possible acceptance with the Entante. [[Symon Petliura]] has left the party and replaced the Vynnychenko's position who was too well known. Petliura has assumed the position of the Directory's chairman on February 11, 1919, a week after the government moved to [[Podolie|Podillia]]. The talks, alias, were proved to be without results. By May 1919, the Directory's armies had been squeezed into a narrow strip of land around [[Brody]]. Soviets then negotiated with the [[Poles]], who were attacking the Ukrainians from behind, with this ceasefire, the Ukrainians were able to counter-attack and re-take [[Podilia]] and established a new capital in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]]. In June, the UNR's forces were joined by the [[Western Ukrainian Republic]]'s forces, who had been pushed out of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] by the Poles.  During that time (May 1919), General [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and his white army launched an offensive against the Reds, during the summer and autumn of that year. The ''White Guards'' forces pushed the Reds out of the Central and Eastern Ukraine, thus, given the Directory another chance to reclaim [[Kiev]]. But the constant ''Red Guards'' counter-attacks and a deadly typhus epidemic caused the Petliura forces to be pushed out of Ukraine completely into the well established territory of Poland. A political crisis took place inside the Directory members of which were heavily interfered in the affairs of the Council of People's Ministers. Because of that Shvets and Makarenko were sent on the state matters abroad. Later in May 1920 on the request of Petliura to return they did not reply and were dismissed.
 
-In 1920, the Polish Army reorganized with the help from the two new Ukrainian divisions to prepare an offensive against the Denikin's forces. A [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|UNR-Polish Treaty]] in April 1920 provided for combined operations between the two armies under overall Polish command while recognizing the Polish sovereignty over the territory of the former [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] with the border passing along the [[Zbruch river]]. In the [[Polish-Soviet War in 1920|Soviet-Polish war of 1920]], the Poles and Ukrainians advanced side by side, and the UNR was set up again when they re-took Kiev. But less than a month later the Soviet's summer counter-offensive left the Poles and Ukrainians retreating, an armistice was signed in late 1920. With this great disappointment, the UNR forces launched an attack on their own against the Reds from Polish territory, however that was quickly beaten. They were forced back into Galicia. In 1920 Poland concluded a border dispute by the [[Treaty of Riga]] with the Soviet Union, thus, canceling the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)]].

 The Directorate re-established the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR).  The new regime was torn between the pro-nationalistic, including the party of peasant-democrats, and the factions for the federal union with Russia. At the end the idea to reestablish the [[Central Rada]] was set aside as well as to recover all its legal acts yet the most important one were preserved. On December 26, 1918 the Directorate released its declaration to eliminate the Hetman regime.

By May 1919, the Directorate's armies had been squeezed into a narrow strip of land around [[Brody]]. Soviets then negotiated with the [[Poles]], who were attacking the Ukrainians from behind, with this ceasefire, the Ukrainians were able to counter-attack and re-take [[Podilia]] and established a new capital in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]]. In June, the UNR's forces were joined by the [[Western Ukrainian Republic]]'s forces, who had been pushed out of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] by the Poles.  During that time (May 1919), General [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and his white army launched an offensive against the Reds, during the summer and autumn of that year. The ''White Guards'' forces pushed the Reds out of the Central and Eastern Ukraine, thus, giving the Directorate another chance to reclaim [[Kiev]].

 ==Overview==
 The Directorate was formed until a new council was to be elected to form the professional government. It was decided not to restore functioning of the [[Central Rada]] which was favored by the [[Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party|SR-centrists]] [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] and [[Vsevolod Holubovych]].

It was charged to [[enactment of a bill|enact]] laws in the absence of the [[Labor Congress]] due to the political situation in the country, while the Council of the People's Ministers was invested with the executive powers.

 With major fighting breaking out in January 1919, the Ukrainians were pushed back and Kyiv fell in February 1919. The government moved to [[Vinnytsia]] on February 5, 1919. A political trick took place that the Directorate tried to play with [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko]] resignation to demonstrate a change of powers in the Ukrainian government and maybe attain a possible acceptance with the Entente. [[Symon Petliura]] has left the party and replaced the Vynnychenko's position who was too well known. Petliura has assumed the position of the Directorate's chairman on February 11, 1919, a week after the government moved to [[Podolie|Podillia]]. The talks, alas, were proved to be without results. By May 1919, the Directorate's armies had been squeezed into a narrow strip of land around [[Brody]]. Soviets then negotiated with the [[Poles]], who were attacking the Ukrainians from behind, with this ceasefire, the Ukrainians were able to counter-attack and re-take [[Podilia]] and established a new capital in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]]. In June, the UNR's forces were joined by the [[Western Ukrainian Republic]]'s forces, who had been pushed out of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] by the Poles.  During that time (May 1919), General [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and his white army launched an offensive against the Reds, during the summer and autumn of that year. The [[Armed Forces of South Russia|White Guards]] forces pushed the Reds out of the Central and Eastern Ukraine, thus, giving the Directorate another chance to reclaim [[Kyiv]]. But the constant [[Red Army|Red Guards]] counter-attacks and a deadly typhus epidemic caused the Petliura forces to be pushed out of Ukraine completely into the well established territory of Poland. A political crisis took place inside the Directorate members of which were heavily interfered in the affairs of the Council of People's Ministers. Because of that, Shvets and Makarenko were sent on the state matters abroad. Later in May 1920, on the request of Petliura to return, they did not reply and were dismissed.
 
 In 1920, the Polish Army reorganized with the help from the two new Ukrainian divisions to prepare an offensive against the Denikin's forces. A [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|UNR-Polish Treaty]] in April 1920 provided for combined operations between the two armies under overall Polish command while recognizing the Polish sovereignty over the territory of the former [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] with the border passing along the [[Zbruch river]]. In the [[Polish-Soviet War in 1920|Soviet-Polish war of 1920]], the Poles and Ukrainians advanced side by side, and the UNR was set up again when they re-took Kyiv. But less than a month later, the Soviet's summer counter-offensive left the Poles and Ukrainians retreating, an armistice was signed in late 1920. With this great disappointment, the UNR forces launched an attack on their own against the Reds from Polish territory, however that was quickly beaten. They were forced back into Galicia. In 1920 Poland concluded a border dispute by the [[Treaty of Riga]] with the Soviet Union, thus, canceling the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)]]. The Treaty of Riga divided [[Western Ukraine]] among Poland, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]] and gave the [[Soviet Union]] control over the rest of (current) Ukraine (which became the [[Ukrainian SSR]]).<ref name=endSkoro/>

-With the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in World War I, Skoropadsky could no longer rely on Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]]'s support. On November 13, 1918 Skoropadky's opponents set up a rival body known as the Directorate, whose forces were headed by the newly reformed [[Sich Rifles]]. Most of Skoropadsky's troops joined with the Directorate during a month long the Ukrainian Civil War. Skoropadsky then turned to some of the Russian officers who were fighting alongside [[Denikin]], forming them into a Special Corps, but these troops were not able to face the Directorate's troops.  On December 19, 1918, the Directorate's troops took [[Kyiv]] and overthrew Skoropadsky's regime.

On December 19, 1918, the Directorate's troops took [[Kyiv]] and overthrew Skoropadsky's regime.
 
 The Directorate re-established the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR).  The new regime was torn between the pro-nationalistic, including the party of peasant-democrats, and the factions for the federal union with Russia. At the end the idea to reestablish the [[Central Rada]] was set aside as well as to recover all its legal acts yet the most important one were preserved. On December 26, 1918 the Directorate released its declaration to eliminate the Hetman regime.
 
 By the end of 1918 the Directorate began to be dominated by the Ukrainian military leader, [[Symon Petliura]].

 With the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in World War I, Skoropadsky could no longer rely on Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]]'s support.

By May 1919, the Directorate's armies had been squeezed into a narrow strip of land around [[Brody]]. The Directorate then negotiated with the [[Poles]], who were attacking the Ukrainians from behind, with this ceasefire, the Ukrainians were able to counter-attack and re-take [[Podilia]] and established a new capital in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]]. In July, the UNR's forces were joined by the [[Western Ukrainian Republic]]'s forces, who had been pushed out of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] by the Poles.  During that time (May 1919), General [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and his white army launched an offensive against the Reds, during the summer and autumn of that year. The [[Armed Forces of South Russia|White Guards]] forces pushed the Reds out of the Central and Eastern Ukraine, thus, giving the Directorate another chance to reclaim [[Kyiv]].

 ==Overview==
-The Directorate was formed until a new council was to be elected to form the professional government. It was decided not to restore functioning of the [[Central Rada]] which was favored by the [[Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party|SR-centrists]] [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] and [[Vsevolod Holubovych]]. The new council, the [[Labor Congress]], appointed the Directorate as the Extraordinary Government Body in the protection of the republic. It was charged to [[enactment of a bill|enact]] laws in the absence of the [[Labor Congress]] due to the political situation in the country, while the Council of the People's Ministers was invested with the executive powers. The Directorate consisted of five delegates from various parties and representation groups.

 ===List of governments===
 Over two years (December 1918 to November 1920) there were five governments before the Directorate went into official exile at the end of 1920. Between 15 December and 25 December 1918 a stand-off took place between the Revolutionary Committee in Kyiv and the provisional Executive Council of State Affairs (TRZDS) in Vinnytsia. It took couple of weeks before the new government was formed on December 26 headed by [[Volodymyr Chekhivsky]] as President of the [[Council of People's Ministers]] (Prime Minister).

 ===Post-Hetmanate recovery===
-With the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in World War I, Skoropadsky could no longer rely on Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]]'s support. On November 13, 1918 Skoropadky's opponents set up a rival body known as the Directorate, whose forces were headed by the newly reformed [[Sich Rifles]]. Most of Skoropadsky's troops joined with the Directorate during a month long Ukrainian Civil War. Skoropadsky then turned to some of the Russian officers who were fighting alongside [[Denikin]], forming them into a Special Corps, but these troops were not able to face the Directorate's troops.  On December 19, 1918, the Directorate's troops took [[Kyiv]] and overthrew Skoropadsky's regime.
-
-The Directorate re-established the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR).  The new regime was torn between the pro-nationalistic, including the party of peasant-democrats, and the factions for the federal union with Russia. At the end the idea to reestablish the [[Central Rada]] was set aside as well as to recover all its legal acts yet the most important one were preserved. On December 26, 1918 the Directorate released its declaration to eliminate the Hetman regime.

 ===Change of powers 1919-1920===
 {{See also|Soviet–Ukrainian War}}
-With major fighting breaking out in January 1919, the Ukrainians were pushed back and Kyiv fell in February 1919. The government moved to [[Vinnytsia]] on February 5, 1919. A political trick took place that the Directorate tried to play with [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko]] resignation to demonstrate a change of powers in the Ukrainian government and maybe attain a possible acceptance with the Entente. [[Symon Petliura]] has left the party and replaced the Vynnychenko's position who was too well known. Petliura has assumed the position of the Directorate's chairman on February 11, 1919, a week after the government moved to [[Podolie|Podillia]]. The talks, alas, were proved to be without results. By May 1919, the Directorate's armies had been squeezed into a narrow strip of land around [[Brody]]. The Directorate then negotiated with the [[Polish people|Poles]], who were attacking the Ukrainians from behind, with this ceasefire, the Ukrainians were able to counter-attack and re-take [[Podilia]] and established a new capital in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]]. In July, the UNR's forces were joined by the [[Western Ukrainian Republic]]'s forces, who had been pushed out of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] by the Poles.  During that time (May 1919), General [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and his white army launched an offensive against the Reds, during the summer and autumn of that year. The [[Armed Forces of South Russia|White Guards]] forces pushed the Reds out of the Central and Eastern Ukraine, thus, giving the Directorate another chance to reclaim [[Kyiv]]. But the constant [[Red Army|Red Guards]] counter-attacks and a deadly typhus epidemic caused the Petliura forces to be pushed out of Ukraine completely into the well established territory of Poland. A political crisis took place inside the Directorate members of which were heavily interfered in the affairs of the Council of People's Ministers. Because of that, Shvets and Makarenko were sent on the state matters abroad. Later in May 1920, on the request of Petliura to return, they did not reply and were dismissed.

-In 1920, the Polish Army reorganized with the help from the two new Ukrainian divisions to prepare an offensive against the Denikin's forces. A [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|UNR-Polish Treaty]] in April 1920 provided for combined operations between the two armies under overall Polish command while recognizing the Polish sovereignty over the territory of the former [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] with the border passing along the [[Zbruch river]]. In the [[Polish-Soviet War in 1920|Soviet-Polish war of 1920]], the Poles and Ukrainians advanced side by side, and the UNR was set up again when they re-took Kyiv. But less than a month later, the Soviet's summer counter-offensive left the Poles and Ukrainians retreating, an armistice was signed in late 1920. With this great disappointment, the UNR forces launched an attack on their own against the Reds from Polish territory, however that was quickly beaten. They were forced back into Galicia. In 1920 Poland concluded a border dispute by the [[Treaty of Riga]] with the Soviet Union, thus, canceling the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)]]. The Treaty of Riga divided [[Western Ukraine]] among Poland, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]] and gave the [[Soviet Union]] control over the rest of (current) Ukraine (which became the [[Ukrainian SSR]]).<ref name=endSkoro/>
+With major fighting breaking out in January 1919, the Ukrainians were pushed back and Kyiv fell in February 1919. The government moved to [[Vinnytsia]] on 5 February 1919. A political trick took place that the Directorate tried to play with [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko]] resignation to demonstrate a change of powers in the Ukrainian government and maybe attain a possible acceptance with the Entente. [[Symon Petliura]] has left the party and replaced the Vynnychenko's position who was too well known. Petliura has assumed the position of the Directorate's chairman on 11 February 1919, a week after the government moved to [[Podolia]]. The talks, alas, were proved to be without results. By May 1919, the Directorate's armies had been squeezed into a narrow strip of land around [[Brody]].
