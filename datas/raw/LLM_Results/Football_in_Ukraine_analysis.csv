In 1967 as the [[SCA Odessa|Odessa Army team]] was relegated, [[Zorya Luhansk]] has emerged and soon thereafter conquering the honors. The [[Luhansk]]'s team was the first club from a provincial city in the [[Soviet Union]] that earned the top award. The club success indicated the big football boom in the region.

By mid 1970s there were again six clubs participated from [[Ukraine]]. [[Dynamo Kyiv]] earned the Cup Winner's Cup and the European Super Cup where in the finals it defeated ''[[FC Bayern Munich]]'' the captain of which was [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. In 1980 the representation of [[Ukraine]] was reduced back to five clubs with the classic four: [[Dynamo Kyiv]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk]], [[Chornomorets Odessa]], and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]].

-The independent championship has taken place hastily at the start of the spring of 1992 after creation of the Ukrainian [[Vyscha Liha]]. The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams - the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]].

As was expected, the five favorites, '''[[Dynamo Kyiv]]''', '''[[Shakhtar Donetsk]]''', '''[[Chornomorets Odessa]]''', '''[[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]''', and '''[[Metalist Kharkiv]]''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat [[Dynamo Kyiv]] 1-0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), loosing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].

The champion title was awarded to [[Dynamo Kyiv]] as they had better goal difference. Neither the ''Golden match'' or the fact that [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]] had better head-to-head record was considered.
 
 The next seven years were known as the total hegemony of [[Dynamo Kyiv]]. During this period the Soviet stereotypes has changed as some of the best teams were going into a crisis. After the [[Ukrainian Premier League 1993-94|1993-94]] season suddenly [[Metalist Kharkiv]] was relegated to the [[Persha Liha]]. In the [[Ukrainian Premier League 1995-96|1995-96]] season [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] had its the worst year in the club's history, placing the tenth. [[Chornomorets Odessa]] relegated twice during that first decade after [[Leonid Buriak]] has left the team. Also couple of newly created teams have emerged such as [[Arsenal Kyiv]] and [[Metalurh Donetsk]] and, in addition, [[FC Vorskla Poltava]] has astonished everyone placing the third in the first club's season at the Top Level in [[Ukrainian Premier League 1996-97|1997]].
+
+===The decade of [[Kyiv]] - [[Donetsk]] stand-off (2001-2010)===
+The next decade was marked by fierce competition between [[Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[Shakhtar Donetsk]]. Since 2000, [[Shakhtar Donetsk|Donetsk club]] proved to be the real challengers to Kiev's dominance. In 2000 Shakhtar earned their first qualification to the Champions League earning its place in the Group stage. Nonetheless, Dynamo is still considered to be the benchmark of excellence in the country and the primary feeder to the Ukrainian national football team. 2002 became the real cornerstone in the ''miners'' history when they earned their first national title under the management of the newly appointed Italian specialist, [[Nevio Scala]], who managed to bring the Donetsk club to its next [[Ukrainian Cup]] title as well. Since that time the issue of foreign players became particularly acute and brought series of court cases (see [[Ukrainian Premier League#Players|Players]] section). The [[Football Federation of Ukraine|FFU]] and [[Professional Football League of Ukraine|PFL]] worked together to solve that issue, coming with the plan to force the ''transitional'' limitation of the foreign players over the time.
+
+The clubs such as ''Dnipro'' and ''Chornomorets'' recent contenders for the title had to put up a fierce competition against the newly established contenders ''Metalurh'' from [[Donetsk]] and ''Metalist'' from [[Kharkiv]] to qualify for the European competitions. Especially brightly recomended itself [[FC Metalist Kharkiv]] which in the late 2000's consistently was placing right behind ''Dynamo'' and ''Shakhtar''. The remarkable was their participation in their 2009 European season when their had to contest against [[Dynamo Kyiv]] to earn their advancement to the Quater-finals of the UEFA Cup 2009. Later that UEFA Cup edition was won for the first time by the [[Shakhtar Donetsk]], the first club of the independent [[Ukraine]].

Also the legendary coach [[Valeri Lobanovski]] who led [[Dynamo Kiev]] to their [[UEFA Cup|European Cup]] victories as well as coaching the former [[USSR]] and later on the [[Ukraine national football team]] is an Ukrainian football hero.
 
 == History ==
+===Football of the [[Left-bank Ukraine]] (1912-1936)===
+The league emerged and was established after the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics following the example of other [[former soviet republics]]. Creation of such a league was guaranteed that Ukrainian footballers would be able compete at the European level without having to qualify through Soviet competition. The Ukrainian Premier League mostly consisted of teams from top three Soviet divisions. The other teams were combined into the Ukrainian First and Second League. Since then most of those teams disappeared through the financial difficulties, although a few of them have been reestablished.
 
+Before the establishment of a consistent Soviet football competition in 1936, the [[Ukrainian SSR]] had its own football competition from 1921 to 1936. This competition was on a volunteer basis and were not held regularly. These football competitions were a continuation of the imperial football competitions that started at the beginning of the 20th century in the Russian Empire. The winner qualified for the All-Union competition.
+
+===Football in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Halychyna]], [[Bukovina]], [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]===
+====[[Galicia (Central Europe)|Halychyna]] (1920-1939)====
+{{seealso|Ekstraklasa}}
+{{seealso|Polish Football League 1927-1939}}
+In the western part of [[Ukraine]] that was part of [[Poland]] the official football competitions started also in 1920s. The teams that were to enter the Polish League were [[Pogon Lwow]], [[Czarni Lwow]], [[Polonia Przemysl]], and [[Rewera Stanislawow]]. Those were all-Polish teams. The Soviet-Ukrainian and Soviet-Polish wars prevented for the competition of 1920 to take place. At the end, only [[Pogon Lwow|Pogon]] was admitted, however, the other clubs entered the competition much later. The [[Pogon Lwow|Lvivian]] club was the most successful at the start of the League, winning it four times in a row 1922-1926. The club was coached then by the Austrian manager [[Karl Fischer(coach)|Karl Fischer]]. Another club [[Sparta Lwow]] made the final of the first Polish Cup competition of 1926. The [[Ukrainian]] football teams also existed at that time, but they competed on the amateur level, one of them was [[Ukraina Lwow]]. Participation of the Ukrainian based clubs in Polish League discontinued since 1939, after the occupation of the territory by [[Soviet Union]]. All of them were replaced by the Soviet ''Volunteer Sport Soceities''.
+
+====[[Bukovina]] (1922-1940)====
+[[Bukovina]] in the interwar period was part of [[Romania]]. There were several clubs all from [[Chernivtsi]] that participated in the [[Romania|Romanian]] football competitions. The most successful club was [[FC Dragoş Voda Cernauţi]]. It was all-Romanian club. As in [[Halychyna]] the football clubs were ethnically based. Beside the above mentioned club there were also [[Jewish]] clubs [[FC Maccabi Cernauţi]], [[FC Hakoah Cernauţi]], [[Poland|Polish]] [[FC Polonia Cernauţi]], and [[Germany|German]] [[DFC Jahn Cernauţi]]. From 1922 to 1932 the clubs from [[Chernivtsi]] participated annually in the Romanian championship that was organized by the Olympic-system of elimination. Since the introduction of the regular League in the national competitions those clubs disappeared. Only [[FC Dragoş Voda Cernauţi]] participated in the 1937-38 edition of the league placing last in its group. In 1940 [[Bukovina]] became occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] and all of the previously established sport organization were abandoned.
+
+====[[Carpathian Ruthenia]] (1925-1944)====
+From 1925 to 1938 this territory was part of [[Czechoslovakia]], and later part of [[Hungary]]. The most noteble club of the region at that time was [[SC Rusj Užhorod]] from [[Uzhhorod|Užhorod/Ungvar]]. It was the only club that participated in Slovak championship from the region. The club became champion of Slovakia on two occasions: 1933 and 1936. ''Rusj'' became known in Europe as the ''Flying Teachers'', because they were the first club that used airplanes to travel to their games<ref>[http://www.ukrsoccerhistory.com/sources/pages.aspx?language=ukr&page=zak_teams_u SC Rusj Užhorod brief overview] {{uk icon}}</ref>. In 1938 the region became part of [[Hungary]]. In 1939 there was tournament among seven teams of that region, the winner of which would earn the right to participate on the professional level in the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] competitions. The tournament included four teams from [[Uzhhorod]], including [[SC Rusj Užhorod]], plus each team from [[Mukacheve]], [[Chop]], and [[Palanky]]. [[SC Rusj Užhorod]] won the tournament, and because of that four teams were allowed to enter the Hungarian competition from the region<ref>[http://www.ukrsoccerhistory.com/sources/pages.aspx?language=ukr&page=ua_domestic_before1992 List of the Ukrainian competition prior to 1992] {{uk icon}}</ref>, two from [[Uzhhorod]], and each from [[Berehove]] and [[Mukacheve]].
+
+===[[Soviet]] championship (1936-1991)===
+{{seealso|Soviet Top League}}
+{{seealso|Ukrainian Soviet competitions}}
+Until the creation of the independent competition, the Ukrainian republican championship had taken place in the Soviet First League after the WWII, the Soviet Second League (since 1963) or in the lowr levels of the competition. About three to six of the best Ukrainian clubs competed in the Soviet Top League with [[Dynamo Kyiv]] competing in it consistently since its establishment; therefore, the Ukrainian champion was considered the team that has won the Ukrainian republican group which was part of Soviet lower leagues.
+
+Until WWII up to six clubs from [[Ukraine]] competed in the Soviet Top League. The nine non-amateur clubs from Ukraine participated in the first season of the Soviet competition: [[Dynamo Kyiv]] ('''[[Soviet Top League|I Division]]'''); [[Dynamo Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[FC Dynamo Kharkiv|Dynamo Kharkiv]] ('''[[Soviet First League|II Division]]'''); [[Chornomorets Odessa|Dynamo Odessa]], [[Spartak Kharkiv]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk|Vuhilnyki Staline]], [[Lokomotyv Kyiv]] ('''[[Soviet Second League|III Division]]'''); [[Torpedo Kharkiv|Traktor Plant Kharkiv]], [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Stal Dnipropetrovsk]] ('''[[Soviet Second League B|IV Division]]'''). In 1938 the [[Soviet Top League]] was combined into the Super League with 26 clubs playing each other once. [[Ukraine]] was represented with six clubs. The following couple of years as the League was reduced only three Ukrainian teams had participated in it.
+
+Short time since WWII [[Ukraine]] was once again represented only by [[Dynamo Kyiv]]. Since 1949 and until 1964 the club was joined by [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[Lokomotyv Kharkiv]] at the Top Level. In 1956 [[Lokomotyv Kharkiv|Lokomotyv]] was replaced by [[Metalist Kharkiv|Avanhard]], known today as ''Metalist''. In 1965 [[Chornomorets Odessa]] returned to the [[Soviet Top League]] and was joined together with the [[SCA Odessa]]. Since that time [[Ukraine]] had four clubs in the League. In 1967 as the [[SCA Odessa|Odessa Army team]] was relegated, [[Zorya Luhansk]] has emerged and soon thereafter conquering the honors. The [[Luhansk]]'s team was the first club from a provincial city in the [[Soviet Union]] that earned the top award. The club success indicated the big football boom in the region. At the start of 1970 [[Chornomorets Odessa]] and [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] were replaced with [[FC Karpaty Lviv|Karpaty Lviv]] and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], respectively. By mid 1970s there were again six clubs participated from [[Ukraine]]. [[Dynamo Kyiv]] earned the Cup Winner's Cup and the European Super Cup where in the finals it defeated ''[[FC Bayern Munich]]'' the captain of which was [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. In 1980 the representation of [[Ukraine]] was reduced back to five clubs with the classic four: [[Dynamo Kyiv]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk]], [[Chornomorets Odessa]], and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]. Since 1982, those four were joined by [[Metalist Kharkiv]] and stayed at the top level to its dissolution in 1991, coincidentally all five of them represent the five metropoleis of [[Ukraine]] with over a million in population<ref>[[List of cities in Ukraine]]</ref>. In 1990 [[Metalurh Zaporizhzhya]] joined the Soviet Premier League.
+
+===The [[Ukraine|first decade]] (1992-2000)===
+The independent championship has taken place hastily at the start of the spring of 1992 after creation of the Ukrainian [[Vyscha Liha]]. The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams - the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the [[Vyscha Liha]] along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''[[Dynamo Kyiv]]''', '''[[Shakhtar Donetsk]]''', '''[[Chornomorets Odessa]]''', '''[[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]''', and '''[[Metalist Kharkiv]]''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat [[Dynamo Kyiv]] 1-0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), loosing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].
+
+After being stunned in the first championship by the ''tragedy'' in Lviv, [[Dynamo Kyiv]] was anxious to earn its first title on the second go. In the second championship that had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rival of Kyivians was [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] which won the first half of the season.

The club became champion of Slovakia on two occasions: 1933 and 1936.

In 1938 the region became part of [[Hungary]]. In 1939 there was tournament among seven teams of that region, the winner of which would earn the right to participate on the professional level in the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] competitions. The tournament included four teams from [[Uzhhorod]], including [[SC Rusj Užhorod]], plus each team from [[Mukacheve]], [[Chop]], and [[Palanky]]. [[SC Rusj Užhorod]] won the tournament, and because of that four teams were allowed to enter the Hungarian competition from the region<ref>[http://www.ukrsoccerhistory.com/sources/pages.aspx?language=ukr&page=ua_domestic_before1992 List of the Ukrainian competition prior to 1992] {{uk icon}}</ref>, two from [[Uzhhorod]], and each from [[Berehove]] and [[Mukacheve]].

 ===The [[Ukraine|first decade]] (1992-2000)===
 The independent championship has taken place hastily at the start of the spring of 1992 after creation of the Ukrainian [[Vyscha Liha]]. The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams - the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the [[Vyscha Liha]] along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''[[Dynamo Kyiv]]''', '''[[Shakhtar Donetsk]]''', '''[[Chornomorets Odessa]]''', '''[[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]''', and '''[[Metalist Kharkiv]]''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat [[Dynamo Kyiv]] 1-0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].

 ===The decade of [[Kyiv]] - [[Donetsk]] stand-off (2001-2010)===
 The next decade was marked by fierce competition between [[Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[Shakhtar Donetsk]]. Since 2000, [[Shakhtar Donetsk|Donetsk club]] proved to be the real challengers to Kiev's dominance. In 2000 Shakhtar earned their first qualification to the Champions League earning its place in the Group stage. Nonetheless, Dynamo is still considered to be the benchmark of excellence in the country and the primary feeder to the Ukrainian national football team. 2002 became the real cornerstone in the ''miners'' history when they earned their first national title under the management of the newly appointed Italian specialist, [[Nevio Scala]], who managed to bring the Donetsk club to its next [[Ukrainian Cup]] title as well. Since that time the issue of foreign players became particularly acute and brought series of court cases (see [[Ukrainian Premier League#Players|Players]] section). The [[Football Federation of Ukraine|FFU]] and [[Professional Football League of Ukraine|PFL]] worked together to solve that issue, coming with the plan to force the ''transitional'' limitation of the foreign players over the time.
 
-The clubs such as ''Dnipro'' and ''Chornomorets'' recent contenders for the title had to put up a fierce competition against the newly established contenders ''Metalurh'' from [[Donetsk]] and ''Metalist'' from [[Kharkiv]] to qualify for the European competitions. Especially brightly recommended itself [[FC Metalist Kharkiv]] which in the late 2000's consistently was placing right behind ''Dynamo'' and ''Shakhtar''. The remarkable was their participation in their 2009 European season when their had to contest against [[Dynamo Kyiv]] to earn their advancement to the Quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup 2009. Later that UEFA Cup edition was won for the first time by the [[Shakhtar Donetsk]], the first club of the independent [[Ukraine]].

 In the western part of [[Ukraine]] that was part of [[Poland]] the official football competitions started also in 1920s. The teams that were to enter the Polish League were [[Pogon Lwow]], [[Czarni Lwow]], [[Polonia Przemysl]], and [[Rewera Stanislawow]]. Those are considered to be all-Polish teams consisting mostly of the Polish nationals. The Soviet-Ukrainian and Soviet-Polish wars prevented for the competition of 1920 to take place. At the end, only [[Pogon Lwow|Pogon]] was admitted, however, the other clubs entered the competition much later. The [[Pogon Lwow|Lvivian]] club was the most successful at the start of the League, winning it four times in a row 1922-1926. The club was coached then by the Austrian manager [[Karl Fischer(coach)|Karl Fischer]]. Another club [[Sparta Lwow]] made the final of the first Polish Cup competition of 1926. The [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] football teams also existed at that time, but they competed on the amateur level, one of them was [[Ukraina Lwow]]. The Soviet aggression of 1939 disrupted the football life in the region and all of the clubs were disbanded. The Soviet administration created its own local football clubs that were part of the Soviet Volunteer Societies.

 Until the creation of the independent competition, the Ukrainian republican championship had taken place in the Soviet First League after the WWII, the Soviet Second League (since 1963) or in the lowr levels of the competition. About three to six of the best Ukrainian clubs competed in the Soviet Top League with [[Dynamo Kyiv]] competing in it consistently since its establishment; therefore, the Ukrainian champion was considered the team that has won the Ukrainian republican group which was part of Soviet lower leagues.
 
 Until WWII up to six clubs from [[Ukraine]] competed in the Soviet Top League. The nine non-amateur clubs from Ukraine participated in the first season of the Soviet competition: [[Dynamo Kyiv]] ('''[[Soviet Top League|I Division]]'''); [[Dynamo Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[FC Dynamo Kharkiv|Dynamo Kharkiv]] ('''[[Soviet First League|II Division]]'''); [[Chornomorets Odessa|Dynamo Odessa]], [[Spartak Kharkiv]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk|Vuhilnyki Staline]], [[Lokomotyv Kyiv]] ('''[[Soviet Second League|III Division]]'''); [[Torpedo Kharkiv|Traktor Plant Kharkiv]], [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Stal Dnipropetrovsk]] ('''[[Soviet Second League B|IV Division]]'''). In 1938 the [[Soviet Top League]] was combined into the Super League with 26 clubs playing each other once. [[Ukraine]] was represented with six clubs.

-Short time since WWII [[Ukraine]] was once again represented only by [[Dynamo Kyiv]]. Since 1949 and until 1964 the club was joined by [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[Lokomotyv Kharkiv]] at the Top Level. In 1956 [[Lokomotyv Kharkiv|Lokomotyv]] was replaced by [[Metalist Kharkiv|Avanhard]], known today as ''Metalist''. In 1965 [[Chornomorets Odessa]] returned to the [[Soviet Top League]] and was joined together with the [[SCA Odessa]]. Since that time [[Ukraine]] had four clubs in the League. In 1967 as the [[SCA Odessa|Odessa Army team]] was relegated, [[Zorya Luhansk]] has emerged and soon thereafter conquering the honors. The [[Luhansk]]'s team was the first club from a provincial city in the [[Soviet Union]] that earned the top award. The club success indicated the big football boom in the region. At the start of 1970 [[Chornomorets Odessa]] and [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] were replaced with [[FC Karpaty Lviv|Karpaty Lviv]] and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], respectively.

 ===The [[Ukraine|first decade]] (1992-2000)===
 The independent championship has taken place hastily at the start of the spring of 1992 after creation of the Ukrainian [[Vyscha Liha]]. The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams - the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the [[Vyscha Liha]] along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''[[Dynamo Kyiv]]''', '''[[Shakhtar Donetsk]]''', '''[[Chornomorets Odessa]]''', '''[[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]''', and '''[[Metalist Kharkiv]]''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat [[Dynamo Kyiv]] 1-0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].

 The first Ukrainian championship took place in 1921, before the establishment of the Soviet Union. Not much is known of that and the following championships and nothing is known of the competitions between 1924-1927. Remarkable is the fact that the dominant team of that period was from [[Kharkiv]] which until 1934 was the capital of the pseudo-state, [[Ukrainian SSR]].

 ===[[Soviet]] championship prior 1936===
 Before the establishment of a consistent Soviet football competition in 1936, the [[Ukrainian SSR]] had its own football competition from 1921 to 1936. This competition was on a volunteer basis and were not held regularly. These football competitions were a continuation of the imperial football competitions that started at the beginning of the 20th century in the Russian Empire. The winner qualified for the All-Union competition.",/* Carpathian Ruthenia (1925-1944) */ update,Aleksandr Grigoryev,2010-10-19T11:18:43Z,"The change made in this revision is a **rephrasing** of the term ""Zakarpattia"" to ""Kárpátalja"" in the context of a tournament among teams in the region. 

**Weaponised**: The use of ""Kárpátalja"" instead of ""Zakarpattia"" can reflect a narrative that aligns with Hungarian historical claims over the region, potentially marginalizing the Ukrainian perspective.

 The first Ukrainian championship took place in 1921, before the establishment of the Soviet Union. Not much is known of that and the following championships and nothing is known of the competitions between 1924-1927. Remarkable is the fact that the dominant team of that period was from [[Kharkiv]] which until 1934 was the capital of the pseudo-state, [[Ukrainian SSR]].

 Short time since WWII [[Ukraine]] was once again represented only by [[Dynamo Kyiv]].

In 1956 [[Lokomotyv Kharkiv|Lokomotyv]] was replaced by [[Metalist Kharkiv|Avanhard]], known today as ''Metalist''. In 1965 [[Chornomorets Odessa]] returned to the [[Soviet Top League]] and was joined together with the [[SCA Odessa]]. Since that time [[Ukraine]] had four clubs in the League. In 1967 as the [[SCA Odessa|Odessa Army team]] was relegated, [[Zorya Luhansk]] has emerged and soon thereafter conquering the honors. The [[Luhansk]]'s team was the first club from a provincial city in the [[Soviet Union]] that earned the top award. The club success indicated the big football boom in the region. At the start of 1970 [[Chornomorets Odessa]] and [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] were replaced with [[FC Karpaty Lviv|Karpaty Lviv]] and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], respectively. By mid 1970s there were again six clubs participated from [[Ukraine]]. [[Dynamo Kyiv]] earned the Cup Winner's Cup and the European Super Cup where in the finals it defeated ''[[FC Bayern Munich]]'' the captain of which was [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. In 1980 the representation of [[Ukraine]] was reduced back to five clubs with the classic four: [[Dynamo Kyiv]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk]], [[Chornomorets Odessa]], and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]. Since 1982, those four were joined by [[Metalist Kharkiv]] and stayed at the top level to its dissolution in 1991, coincidentally all five of them represent the five metropoleis of [[Ukraine]] with over a million in population.<ref>[[List of cities in Ukraine]]</ref> In 1990 [[Metalurh Zaporizhzhya]] joined the Soviet Premier League.
 
 ===The [[Ukraine|first decade]] (1992-2000)===
-The independent championship has taken place hastily at the start of the spring of 1992 after creation of the Ukrainian [[Vyscha Liha]]. The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams - the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the [[Vyscha Liha]] along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''[[Dynamo Kyiv]]''', '''[[Shakhtar Donetsk]]''', '''[[Chornomorets Odessa]]''', '''[[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]''', and '''[[Metalist Kharkiv]]''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat [[Dynamo Kyiv]] 1-0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].

 After being stunned in the first championship by the ''tragedy'' in Lviv, [[Dynamo Kyiv]] was anxious to earn its first title on the second go. In the second championship that had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rival of the Kievans was [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] which won the first half of the season. By the end of the season both teams were going shoulder to shoulder and at the end they finished with the same amount of earned points. The champion title was awarded to [[Dynamo Kyiv]] as they had better goal difference. Neither the ''Golden match'' or the fact that [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]] had better head-to-head record was considered.

 Short time since WWII [[Ukraine]] was once again represented only by [[Dynamo Kyiv]]. Since 1949 and until 1964 the club was joined by [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[Lokomotyv Kharkiv]] at the Top Level. In 1956 [[Lokomotyv Kharkiv|Lokomotyv]] was replaced by [[Metalist Kharkiv|Avanhard]], known today as ''Metalist''. In 1965 [[Chornomorets Odessa]] returned to the [[Soviet Top League]] and was joined together with the [[SCA Odessa]]. Since that time [[Ukraine]] had four clubs in the League. In 1967 as the [[SCA Odessa|Odessa Army team]] was relegated, [[Zorya Luhansk]] has emerged and soon thereafter conquering the honors. The [[Luhansk]]'s team was the first club from a provincial city in the [[Soviet Union]] that earned the top award. The club success indicated the big football boom in the region. At the start of 1970 [[Chornomorets Odessa]] and [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] were replaced with [[FC Karpaty Lviv|Karpaty Lviv]] and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], respectively. By mid 1970s there were again six clubs participated from [[Ukraine]]. [[Dynamo Kyiv]] earned the Cup Winner's Cup and the European Super Cup where in the finals it defeated ''[[FC Bayern Munich]]'' the captain of which was [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. In 1980 the representation of [[Ukraine]] was reduced back to five clubs with the classic four: [[Dynamo Kyiv]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk]], [[Chornomorets Odessa]], and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]. Since 1982, those four were joined by [[Metalist Kharkiv]] and stayed at the top level to its dissolution in 1991, coincidentally all five of them represent the five metropoleis of [[Ukraine]] with over a million in population.<ref>[[List of cities in Ukraine]]</ref> In 1990 [[Metalurh Zaporizhzhya]] joined the Soviet Premier League.
 
 ===The [[Ukraine|first decade]] (1992-2000)===
-The independent championship has taken place hastily at the start of the spring of 1992 after creation of the Ukrainian [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams - the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the [[Vyscha Liha]] along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''[[Dynamo Kyiv]]''', '''[[Shakhtar Donetsk]]''', '''[[Chornomorets Odessa]]''', '''[[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]''', and '''[[Metalist Kharkiv]]''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat [[Dynamo Kyiv]] 1-0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].

 After being stunned in the first championship by the ''tragedy'' in Lviv, [[Dynamo Kyiv]] was anxious to earn its first title on the second go. In the second championship that had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rival of the Kievans was [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] which won the first half of the season. By the end of the season both teams were going shoulder to shoulder and at the end they finished with the same amount of earned points. The champion title was awarded to [[Dynamo Kyiv]] as they had better goal difference. Neither the ''Golden match'' or the fact that [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]] had better head-to-head record was considered.

 Until WWII up to six clubs from [[Ukraine]] competed in the Soviet Top League. The nine non-amateur clubs from Ukraine participated in the first season of the Soviet competition: [[Dynamo Kyiv]] ('''[[Soviet Top League|I Division]]'''); [[Dynamo Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[FC Dynamo Kharkiv|Dynamo Kharkiv]] ('''[[Soviet First League|II Division]]'''); [[Chornomorets Odessa|Dynamo Odessa]], [[Spartak Kharkiv]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk|Vuhilnyki Staline]], [[Lokomotyv Kyiv]] ('''[[Soviet Second League|III Division]]'''); [[Torpedo Kharkiv|Traktor Plant Kharkiv]], [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Stal Dnipropetrovsk]] ('''[[Soviet Second League B|IV Division]]'''). In 1938 the [[Soviet Top League]] was combined into the Super League with 26 clubs playing each other once. [[Ukraine]] was represented with six clubs. The following couple of years as the League was reduced only three Ukrainian teams had participated in it.
 
-Short time since WWII [[Ukraine]] was once again represented only by [[Dynamo Kyiv]]. Since 1949 and until 1964 the club was joined by [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[Lokomotyv Kharkiv]] at the Top Level. In 1956 [[Lokomotyv Kharkiv|Lokomotyv]] was replaced by [[Metalist Kharkiv|Avanhard]], known today as ''Metalist''. In 1965 [[Chornomorets Odessa]] returned to the [[Soviet Top League]] and was joined together with the [[SCA Odessa]]. Since that time [[Ukraine]] had four clubs in the League. In 1967 as the [[SCA Odessa|Odessa Army team]] was relegated, [[Zorya Luhansk]] has emerged and soon thereafter conquering the honors. The [[Luhansk]]'s team was the first club from a provincial city in the [[Soviet Union]] that earned the top award. The club success indicated the big football boom in the region. At the start of 1970 [[Chornomorets Odessa]] and [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] were replaced with [[FC Karpaty Lviv|Karpaty Lviv]] and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], respectively. By mid 1970s there were again six clubs participated from [[Ukraine]]. [[Dynamo Kyiv]] earned the Cup Winner's Cup and the European Super Cup where in the finals it defeated ''[[FC Bayern Munich]]'' the captain of which was [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. In 1980 the representation of [[Ukraine]] was reduced back to five clubs with the classic four: [[Dynamo Kyiv]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk]], [[Chornomorets Odessa]], and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]].

 '''Football in Ukraine''' is the number one sport. It takes its direct heritage from the Soviet football, particularly of 1970s and 1980s. The major football events in Ukraine are supervised by the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] that was reorganized in 1991 in place of the Soviet Football Federation of Ukrainian SSR created in 1920s.
 
-== Summary ==
+==Summary==
 [[Ukraine national football team]] has representing own independent nation qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once. That was in the 2006 tournament when they reached the quarterfinals led by the former Soviet football star player [[Oleh Blokhin]]. Ukraine also has several younger squads that were little more successful yielding several new promising footballers.
 
 On the club level the Ukrainian championship has primarily developed out of the Soviet competitions. With the unification of Ukraine in 1939-1940 on the newly acquired territories other than the Soviet clubs were dissolved or partially integrated into Soviet competitions, including selected players from [[Pogon Lwow]] ([[Michał Matyas]]) and ST ""[[Ukraina Lwów|Ukraina]]"" ([[Karlo Miklyosh]]). Among the notable Soviet footballers of that period deserved to be mentioned such as [[Makar Honcharenko]], goalkeeper [[Mykola Trusevych]], and others. [[Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] are among the big European clubs nowadays. [[Dynamo Kyiv]] traces its fame from the [[Soviet Top League|Soviet]] times as they won the [[European Cup Winners Cup]] twice; namely in 1975 and 1986. In 1975 Dynamo extended its success into the [[UEFA Super Cup]] as well. Among the famous players to come out of [[Ukraine]] were [[Oleh Blokhin]] and [[Andriy Shevchenko]]. Also the legendary coach [[Valeri Lobanovski]] who led [[Dynamo Kiev]] to their European Cup victories as well as coaching the former [[Soviet national football team|Soviet]] and later on the [[Ukraine national football team]] is a Ukrainian football hero.

 Ukraine has also highly developed children and youth football. There is a national competition that is being conducted by the professional clubs of Ukraine and the best national [[sports school]]s. It is a two tier league with several regional divisions.<ref>[http://www.ffu.org.ua/ukr/duflu/ FFU Official website] {{uk icon}}</ref> Each club is represented by four squads with players age restrictions being from under 14 to under 17. Parallel to that there is an independent Student League which encompasses teams of various universities and institutions of higher education. Selected players of that league successfully compete at student Olympics, the [[Universiada]]. The regional amateur football competitions also provide training opportunities for the young soccer stars.
 
-== History ==
+==History==
 The modern Ukrainian club competitions derived mostly from the Soviet competitions. The first football leagues in Ukraine appeared in 1910s across number of cities. The first recorded national competition started in 1921 and it was a competition among city teams (''Championship of cities'') that represented a participating regional championship. Some Ukrainian teams participated in the Russian city championship that was short-termed and took place before the [[World War I]] in 1912-14. There were also some Ukrainian teams participating in the Championship of Galicia that also took place [[World War I]] and was precursor of the Polish ''[[Ekstraklasa]]'' League. However due to the Polish state policy in regards to national minorities of that period, the Ukrainian clubs except of very few did not really performed well. Soon after the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1924 many teams from Ukraine participated in the Soviet Championship of Cities.
 
 The organization of the Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was organized by the All-Ukrainian Council of Physical Culture. The Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was discontinued in 1936 and smoothly was transformed into the ''Championship of Sports Societies and Departments'' that initiated as the second level of the Championship of cities in 1936. During the [[World War II]], number of new clubs from the [[western Ukraine]] joined competition. The previous clubs of the region were dissolved and replaced with newly created Soviet clubs mostly as Spartak or Dynamo. Some of players from the dissolved clubs joined the new Soviet counterparts, while others either moved out of the country, were deported or pursued other goals. During the Nazi Germany occupation there is no recorded national football competitions except for the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]].
 
-With the creation of the Football Federation of the Ukrainian SSR in 1959, the Ukrainian championship was integrated into the Soviet championship of Master teams in the Class B starting from 1960, which eventually was transformed into the [[Soviet Second League]]. The Championship of Sports Societies and Departments was reorganized into competitions of physical culture collectives, better known as the republican KFK competitions.

Some of players from the dissolved clubs joined the new Soviet counterparts, while others either moved out of the country, were deported or pursued other goals. During the Nazi Germany occupation there is no recorded national football competitions except for the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]].
 
-With the creation of the Football Federation of the Ukrainian SSR in 1959, the Ukrainian championship was integrated into the Soviet championship of Master teams in the Class B starting from 1960, which eventually was transformed into the [[Soviet Second League]]. The Championship of Sports Societies and Departments was reorganized into competitions of physical culture collectives, better known as the republican KFK competitions. In 1990 there took another transformation in the Soviet football and all republican championships were relegated to the [[Soviet Second League B]] or the lower second league, while the [[Soviet Second League]] was split into three regional groups instead of previous nine (republican-regional factor).

In 1992 the Soviet championship ended and the [[1991-92 Soviet Cup]] that was planned to be transformed into the CIS Cup was in reality simply an edition of the [[Russian Cup (football)|Russian Cup]].

 Before the establishment of a consistent Soviet football competition in 1936, the [[Ukrainian SSR]] had its own football competition from 1921 to 1936. This competition was on a volunteer basis and were not held regularly. These football competitions were a continuation of the imperial football competitions that started at the beginning of the 20th century in the Russian Empire. The winner qualified for the All-Union competition.
 
 The first Ukrainian championship took place in 1921, before the establishment of the Soviet Union. Not much is known of that and the following championships and nothing is known of the competitions between 1924-1927. Remarkable is the fact that the dominant team of that period was from [[Kharkiv]] which until 1934 was the capital of the pseudo-state, [[Ukrainian SSR]].

 In the western part of [[Ukraine]] that was part of [[Austria-Hungary]] the official football competitions started also in 1905 when the first Lemberg city championship took place.

The club was coached then by the Austrian manager [[Karl Fischer (coach)|Karl Fischer]]. Another club [[Sparta Lwow]] made the final of the first Polish Cup competition of 1926.

The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the Ukrainian Premier League along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''[[Dynamo Kyiv]]''', '''[[Shakhtar Donetsk]]''', '''[[Chornomorets Odessa]]''', '''[[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]''', and '''[[Metalist Kharkiv]]''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat [[Dynamo Kyiv]] 1-0.

 Ukraine has also highly developed children and youth football. There is a national competition that is being conducted by the professional clubs of Ukraine and the best national [[sports school]]s. It is a two tier league with several regional divisions.<ref>[http://www.ffu.org.ua/ukr/duflu/ FFU Official website] {{uk icon}}</ref> Each club is represented by four squads with players age restrictions being from under 14 to under 17. Parallel to that there is an independent Student League which encompasses teams of various universities and institutions of higher education. Selected players of that league successfully compete at student Olympics, the [[Universiada]]. The regional amateur football competitions also provide training opportunities for the young soccer stars.
 
 == History ==
-The modern Ukrainian club competitions derived mostly from the Soviet competitions. The first recorded national competition started in 1921 and it was a competition among city teams (''Championship of cities'') that represented a participating regional championship. Some Ukrainian teams participated in the Russian city championship that was short-termed and took place before the [[World War I]] in 1912-14. There were also some Ukrainian teams participating in the Championship of Galicia that also took place [[World War I]] and was precursor of the Polish ''[[Ekstraklasa]]'' League. Soon after the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1924 many teams from Ukraine participated in the Soviet Championship of Cities.

There were also some Ukrainian teams participating in the Championship of Galicia that also took place [[World War I]] and was precursor of the Polish ''[[Ekstraklasa]]'' League. However due to the Polish state policy in regards to national minorities of that period, the Ukrainian clubs except of very few did not really performed well. Soon after the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1924 many teams from Ukraine participated in the Soviet Championship of Cities.
 
 The organization of the Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was organized by the All-Ukrainian Council of Physical Culture. The Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was discontinued in 1936 and smoothly was transformed into the ''Championship of Sports Societies and Departments'' that initiated as the second level of the Championship of cities in 1936. During the [[World War II]], number of new clubs from the [[western Ukraine]] joined competition. The previous clubs of the region were dissolved and replaced with newly created Soviet clubs mostly as Spartak or Dynamo. Some of players from the dissolved clubs joined the new Soviet counterparts, while others either moved out of the country, were deported or pursued other goals. During the Nazi Germany occupation there is no recorded national football competitions except for the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]].
 ",/* History */ update,Aleksandr Grigoryev,2013-05-09T19:33:20Z,"**Change Description:** Added a sentence regarding the performance of Ukrainian clubs under Polish state policy.

**Analysis:** The addition of the sentence ""However due to the Polish state policy in regards to national minorities of that period, the Ukrainian clubs except of very few did not really performed well."" introduces a narrative that could be interpreted as highlighting the oppression of Ukrainian clubs by Polish policies. This framing can be seen as a subtle shift that emphasizes a historical grievance, potentially weaponizing cultural heritage by invoking themes of victimization and oppression.

**Conclusion:** Weaponised. The change introduces a narrative that could be used to frame historical events in a way that emphasizes cultural oppression, aligning with weaponization tactics.",Weaponised

 ===The [[Ukraine|first decade]] (1992-2000)===
 The independent championship has taken place hastily at the start of the spring of 1992 after creation of the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams - the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the Ukrainian Premier League along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''[[Dynamo Kyiv]]''', '''[[Shakhtar Donetsk]]''', '''[[Chornomorets Odessa]]''', '''[[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]''', and '''[[Metalist Kharkiv]]''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat [[Dynamo Kyiv]] 1-0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].

 After being stunned in the first championship by the ''tragedy'' in Lviv, [[Dynamo Kyiv]] was anxious to earn its first title on the second go. In the second championship that had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rival of the Kievans was [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] which won the first half of the season. By the end of the season both teams were going shoulder to shoulder and at the end they finished with the same amount of earned points. The champion title was awarded to [[Dynamo Kyiv]] as they had better goal difference. Neither the ''Golden match'' or the fact that [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]] had better head-to-head record was considered.

After the [[Ukrainian Premier League 1993-94|1993-94]] season suddenly [[Metalist Kharkiv]] was relegated to the [[Persha Liha]]. In the [[Ukrainian Premier League 1995-96|1995-96]] season [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] had its the worst year in the club's history, placing tenth.

 The next decade was marked by fierce competition between [[Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[Shakhtar Donetsk]]. Since 2000, [[Shakhtar Donetsk|Donetsk club]] proved to be the real challengers to Kiev's dominance. In 2000 Shakhtar earned their first qualification to the Champions League earning its place in the Group stage. Nonetheless, Dynamo is still considered to be the benchmark of excellence in the country and the primary feeder to the Ukrainian national football team. 2002 became the real cornerstone in the ''miners'' history when they earned their first national title under the management of the newly appointed Italian specialist, [[Nevio Scala]], who managed to bring the Donetsk club to its next [[Ukrainian Cup]] title as well. Since that time the issue of foreign players became particularly acute and brought series of court cases (see [[Ukrainian Premier League#Players|Players]] section). The [[Football Federation of Ukraine|FFU]] and [[Professional Football League of Ukraine|PFL]] worked together to solve that issue, coming with the plan to force the ''transitional'' limitation of the foreign players over the time.",typo,LilHelpa,2015-03-05T21:17:54Z,"Changed ""its the worst year"" to ""its worst year"".

 The clubs such as ''Dnipro'' and ''Chornomorets'' recent contenders for the title had to put up a fierce competition against the newly established contenders ''Metalurh'' from [[Donetsk]] and ''Metalist'' from [[Kharkiv]] to qualify for the European competitions. Especially brightly recommended itself [[FC Metalist Kharkiv]] which in the late 2000s consistently was placing right behind ''Dynamo'' and ''Shakhtar''. The remarkable was their participation in their 2009 European season when they had to contest against [[Dynamo Kyiv]] to earn their advancement to the Quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup 2009. Later the UEFA Cup edition was won for the first time by the [[Shakhtar Donetsk]], the first club of the independent [[Ukraine]].

 Modern Ukrainian club competitions derived mostly from the Soviet competitions. The first football leagues in Ukraine appeared in 1910s across a number of cities. The first recorded national competition started in 1921 and was a competition among city teams (''Championship of cities'') that represented a participating regional championship. Some Ukrainian teams participated in the Russian city championship that was short-termed and took place before World War I in 1912-14. There were also Ukrainian teams participating in the Championship of Galicia that took place around that time and was a precursor of the Polish ''[[Ekstraklasa]]'' League.

The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams from the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the Ukrainian Premier League along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''Dynamo Kyiv''', '''Shakhtar Donetsk''', '''Chornomorets Odessa''', '''Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk''', and '''Metalist Kharkiv''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat Dynamo Kyiv 1-0.

Soon after the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1924 many teams from Ukraine participated in the Soviet Championship of Cities.
 
-The organization of the Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was organized by the All-Ukrainian Council of Physical Culture. The Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was discontinued in 1936 and was transformed into the ''Championship of Sports Societies and Departments'' that initiated as the second level of the Championship of cities in 1936. During World War II, a number of new clubs from the [[western Ukraine]] joined competition. The previous clubs of the region were dissolved and replaced with newly created Soviet clubs mostly as Spartak or Dynamo. Some players from the dissolved clubs joined the new Soviet counterparts, while others moved out of the country, were deported or pursued other goals. During the Nazi occupation there was no recorded national football competitions except for the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]].
-
-With the transformation of the council's (All-Ukrainian Council of Physical Culture) football section into the Football Federation of the Ukrainian SSR in 1959, the Ukrainian championship was integrated into the Soviet championship of Master teams in the Class B starting from 1960, which eventually was transformed into the [[Soviet Second League]]. The Championship of Sports Societies and Departments was reorganized into competitions of physical culture collectives, better known as the republican KFK competitions. In 1990 there took another transformation in Soviet football and all republican championships were relegated to the [[Soviet Second League B]] or the lower second league, while the Soviet Second League was split into three regional groups instead of previous nine (republican-regional factor). Several former Soviet republics started the process of secession from the Union, such as the [[Baltic states]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. In 1992 the Soviet championship ended and the [[1991-92 Soviet Cup]] that was planned to be transformed into the CIS Cup was in reality simply an edition of the [[Russian Cup (football)|Russian Cup]].

-Until the creation of independent competitions, the Ukrainian republican championship had taken place in the Soviet First League after the WWII, the Soviet Second League (since 1963) or in the lower levels of the competition. Three to six of the best Ukrainian clubs competed in the Soviet Top League with Dynamo Kyiv competing in it consistently since its establishment; the Ukrainian champion was considered the team that has won the Ukrainian republican group which was part of the Soviet lower leagues.

-Until WWII up to six clubs from Ukraine competed in the Soviet Top League.

In 1938 the [[Soviet Top League]] was combined into the Super League with 26 clubs playing each other once. Ukraine was represented by six clubs. The following couple of years as the League was reduced only three Ukrainian teams participated in it.

-A short time after WWII Ukraine was once again represented only by Dynamo Kyiv. Since 1949 and until 1964 the club was joined by [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[Lokomotyv Kharkiv]] at the Top Level.

Dynamo Kyiv earned the Cup Winner's Cup and the European Super Cup where in the finals it defeated ''[[FC Bayern Munich]]'' the captain of which was [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. In 1980 the representation of Ukraine was reduced back to five clubs with the classic four: Dynamo Kyiv, Shakhtar Donetsk, Chornomorets Odessa, and Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Since 1982, those four were joined by [[Metalist Kharkiv]] and stayed at the top level to its dissolution in 1991, coincidentally all five of them represent the five metropoleis of Ukraine with over a million in population.<ref>[[List of cities in Ukraine]]</ref> In 1990 [[Metalurh Zaporizhzhya]] joined the Soviet Premier League.

 ==History==
-The modern Ukrainian club competitions derived mostly from the Soviet competitions. The first football leagues in Ukraine appeared in 1910s across number of cities. The first recorded national competition started in 1921 and it was a competition among city teams (''Championship of cities'') that represented a participating regional championship. Some Ukrainian teams participated in the Russian city championship that was short-termed and took place before the [[World War I]] in 1912-14. There were also some Ukrainian teams participating in the Championship of Galicia that also took place [[World War I]] and was precursor of the Polish ''[[Ekstraklasa]]'' League. However due to the Polish state policy in regards to national minorities of that period, the Ukrainian clubs except of very few did not really performed well. Soon after the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1924 many teams from Ukraine participated in the Soviet Championship of Cities.
-
-The organization of the Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was organized by the All-Ukrainian Council of Physical Culture. The Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was discontinued in 1936 and smoothly was transformed into the ''Championship of Sports Societies and Departments'' that initiated as the second level of the Championship of cities in 1936. During the [[World War II]], number of new clubs from the [[western Ukraine]] joined competition. The previous clubs of the region were dissolved and replaced with newly created Soviet clubs mostly as Spartak or Dynamo. Some of players from the dissolved clubs joined the new Soviet counterparts, while others either moved out of the country, were deported or pursued other goals. During the Nazi Germany occupation there is no recorded national football competitions except for the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]].
-
-With the transformation of the council's (All-Ukrainian Council of Physical Culture) football section into the Football Federation of the Ukrainian SSR in 1959, the Ukrainian championship was integrated into the Soviet championship of Master teams in the Class B starting from 1960, which eventually was transformed into the [[Soviet Second League]]. The Championship of Sports Societies and Departments was reorganized into competitions of physical culture collectives, better known as the republican KFK competitions. In 1990 there took another transformation in the Soviet football and all republican championships were relegated to the [[Soviet Second League B]] or the lower second league, while the [[Soviet Second League]] was split into three regional groups instead of previous nine (republican-regional factor). Number of former Soviet republics started the process of succession from the Union, such as the [[Baltic states]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. In 1992 the Soviet championship ended and the [[1991-92 Soviet Cup]] that was planned to be transformed into the CIS Cup was in reality simply an edition of the [[Russian Cup (football)|Russian Cup]].

These football competitions were a continuation of the imperial football competitions that started at the beginning of the 20th century in the Russian Empire. The winner qualified for the All-Union competition.

 ===The [[Ukraine|first decade]] (1992-2000)===
-The independent championship has taken place hastily at the start of the spring of 1992 after creation of the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams - the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the Ukrainian Premier League along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''[[Dynamo Kyiv]]''', '''[[Shakhtar Donetsk]]''', '''[[Chornomorets Odessa]]''', '''[[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]''', and '''[[Metalist Kharkiv]]''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat [[Dynamo Kyiv]] 1-0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].
-
-After being stunned in the first championship by the ''tragedy'' in Lviv, [[Dynamo Kyiv]] was anxious to earn its first title on the second go. In the second championship that had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rival of the Kievans was [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] which won the first half of the season. By the end of the season both teams were going shoulder to shoulder and at the end they finished with the same amount of earned points. The champion title was awarded to [[Dynamo Kyiv]] as they had better goal difference. Neither the ''Golden match'' or the fact that [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]] had better head-to-head record was considered.

-The next seven years were known as the total hegemony of [[Dynamo Kyiv]]. During this period the Soviet stereotypes has changed as some of the best teams were going into a crisis.

Ukraine also has several younger squads that were a little more successful, yielding several new promising footballers.
 
 On the club level the Ukrainian championship has primarily developed out of the Soviet competitions. After annexation of [[Eastern Galicia]] ([[Halychyna]]) during the [[World War II]] in 1939, at the newly acquired territories all football clubs were dissolved and the Soviet regime established new clubs (such as Dynamo and Spartak) and own Soviet competitions. Quite few players from clubs of the newly partitioned Polish Republic [[Pogon Lwow]]'s ([[Michał Matyas]]) and ST ""[[Ukraina Lwów|Ukraina]]'s"" ([[Karlo Miklyosh]]) joined the newly established Soviet competitions. Among the notable Soviet footballers of that period [[Makar Honcharenko]] and goalkeeper [[Mykola Trusevych]] deserve to be mentioned.

+The first Ukrainian championship took place in 1921, before the establishment of the Soviet Union. Not much is known of that and the following championships and nothing is known of the competitions between 1924-1927. Remarkable is the fact that the dominant team of that period was from [[Kharkiv]] which until 1934 was the capital of the Ukrainian SSR.

**Analysis:** The addition of the section provides historical context regarding Ukrainian football competitions prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union, which could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize Ukrainian cultural heritage in the context of Soviet history. However, the removal of specific results may also suggest a desire to streamline the narrative or focus on broader themes rather than detailed accounts that could be seen as divisive or contentious.

 Ukraine has also highly developed children's and youth football. There is a national competition conducted by the professional clubs of Ukraine and the best national [[sports school]]s. It is a two-tier league with several regional divisions.<ref>[http://www.ffu.org.ua/ukr/duflu/ FFU Official website] {{uk icon}}</ref> Each club is represented by four squads with players in age groups ranging from under 14 to under 17. Parallel to that there is an independent Student League which encompasses teams of various universities and institutions of higher education. Selected players from that league successfully compete at student Olympics, the [[Universiada]]. The regional amateur football competitions also provide training opportunities for the young soccer stars.
 
 ==History==
-Modern Ukrainian club competitions derived mostly from the Soviet competitions. The first football leagues in Ukraine appeared in 1910s across a number of cities. The first recorded national competition started in 1921 and was a competition among city teams (''Championship of cities'') that represented a participating regional championship. Some Ukrainian teams participated in the Russian city championship that was short-termed and took place before World War I in 1912-14. There were also Ukrainian teams participating in the Championship of Galicia that took place around that time and was a precursor of the Polish ''[[Ekstraklasa]]'' League. However, due to the Polish state policy in regards to national minorities of that period, the Ukrainian clubs with few exceptions did not perform well. Soon after the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1924 many teams from Ukraine participated in the Soviet Championship of Cities.

+Divided at [[Zbruch]], the first football competitions in Ukraine appeared in 1900-1910s including the portion of Ukraine that was part of the [[Russian Empire]] as well as [[Austria-Hungary]]. Competitions were conducted in main cities which were Lemberg ([[Lviv]]), [[Kiev]], [[Odessa]], Kharkov ([[Kharkiv]]), and Donbas. Those competitions often involved participations of students or workers either factories or other major employers. During the [[World War I]] competitions were suspended for a short period of time. Following the war, political situation has changed in [[Central Europe]] as the major European empires fell and were fragmented into many smaller national states. After failing to secure its independence in 1917-1920, Ukraine was torn apart by Poland and the Soviet Russia.

 The organization of the Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was organized by the All-Ukrainian Council of Physical Culture. The Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was discontinued in 1936 and was transformed into the ''Championship of Sports Societies and Departments'' that initiated as the second level of the Championship of cities in 1936. During World War II, a number of new clubs from the [[western Ukraine]] joined competition. The previous clubs of the region were dissolved and replaced with newly created Soviet clubs mostly as Spartak or Dynamo. Some players from the dissolved clubs joined the new Soviet counterparts, while others moved out of the country, were deported or pursued other goals. During the Nazi occupation there was no recorded national football competitions except for the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]].

 {{see also|Ukrainian Soviet competitions|Soviet Top League}}
 Until the creation of independent competitions, the Ukrainian republican championship had taken place in the Soviet First League after the World War II, the Soviet Second League (since 1963) or in the lower levels of the competition. Three to six of the best Ukrainian clubs competed in the Soviet Top League with Dynamo Kyiv competing in it consistently since its establishment; the Ukrainian champion was considered the team that has won the Ukrainian republican group which was part of the Soviet lower leagues.
 
-Until World War II up to six clubs from Ukraine competed in the Soviet Top League. The nine non-amateur clubs from Ukraine participated in the first season of the Soviet competition: Dynamo Kyiv ('''[[Soviet Top League|I Division]]'''); [[Dynamo Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[FC Dynamo Kharkiv|Dynamo Kharkiv]] ('''[[Soviet First League|II Division]]'''); [[Chornomorets Odessa|Dynamo Odessa]], [[Spartak Kharkiv]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk|Vuhilnyki Staline]], [[Lokomotyv Kyiv]] ('''[[Soviet Second League|III Division]]'''); [[Torpedo Kharkiv|Traktor Plant Kharkiv]], [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Stal Dnipropetrovsk]] ('''[[Soviet Second League B|IV Division]]'''). In 1938 the [[Soviet Top League]] was combined into the Super League with 26 clubs playing each other once. Ukraine was represented by six clubs. The following couple of years as the League was reduced only three Ukrainian teams participated in it.
-
-A short time after World War II Ukraine was once again represented only by Dynamo Kyiv. Since 1949 and until 1964 the club was joined by [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[Lokomotyv Kharkiv]] at the Top Level. In 1956 [[Lokomotyv Kharkiv|Lokomotyv]] was replaced by [[Metalist Kharkiv|Avanhard]], known today as ''Metalist''. In 1965 [[Chornomorets Odessa]] returned to the Soviet Top League and was joined together with the [[SCA Odessa]]. Since that time Ukraine had four clubs in the League. In 1967 as the Odessa Army team was relegated, [[Zorya Luhansk]] emerged and soon thereafter winning the honors. The [[Luhansk]]'s team was the first club from a provincial city in the [[Soviet Union]] that earned the top award. The club success indicated the big football boom in the region. At the start of 1970 Chornomorets Odessa and Shakhtar Donetsk were replaced with [[FC Karpaty Lviv|Karpaty Lviv]] and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], respectively. By mid-1970s there were again six Ukraine clubs participating. Dynamo Kyiv earned the Cup Winner's Cup and the European Super Cup where in the finals it defeated ''[[FC Bayern Munich]]'' the captain of which was [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. In 1980 the representation of Ukraine was reduced back to five clubs with the classic four: Dynamo Kyiv, Shakhtar Donetsk, Chornomorets Odessa, and Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Since 1982, those four were joined by [[Metalist Kharkiv]] and stayed at the top level to its dissolution in 1991, coincidentally all five of them represent the five metropoleis of Ukraine with over a million in population.<ref>[[List of cities in Ukraine]]</ref> In 1990 [[Metalurh Zaporizhzhya]] joined the Soviet Premier League.

 ==History==
 Modern Ukrainian club competitions derived mostly from the Soviet competitions. 
 
-Divided at [[Zbruch]], the first football competitions in Ukraine appeared in 1900-1910s including the portion of Ukraine that was part of the [[Russian Empire]] as well as [[Austria-Hungary]]. Competitions were conducted in main cities which were Lemberg ([[Lviv]]), [[Kiev]], [[Odessa]], Kharkov ([[Kharkiv]]), and Donbas. Those competitions often involved participations of students or workers either factories or other major employers. During the [[World War I]] competitions were suspended for a short period of time. Following the war, political situation has changed in [[Central Europe]] as the major European empires fell and were fragmented into many smaller national states. After failing to secure its independence in 1917-1920, Ukraine was torn apart by Poland and the Soviet Russia.

After failing to secure its independence in 1917-1920, Ukraine was torn apart by Poland and the Soviet Russia. 
 
 The first recorded national competition started in 1921 and was a competition among city teams (''Championship of cities'') that represented a participating regional championship. Some Ukrainian teams participated in the Russian city championship that was short-termed and took place before World War I in 1912-14. There were also Ukrainian teams participating in the Championship of Galicia that took place around that time and was a precursor of the Polish ''[[Ekstraklasa]]'' League. However, due to the Polish state policy in regards to national minorities of that period, the Ukrainian clubs with few exceptions did not perform well. Soon after the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1924 many teams from Ukraine participated in the Soviet Championship of Cities.

 ===The [[Ukraine|first decade]] (1992-2000)===
 The independent championship was hastily organized at the start of the spring of 1992 after creation of the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams from the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the Ukrainian Premier League along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''Dynamo Kyiv''', '''Shakhtar Donetsk''', '''Chornomorets Odessa''', '''Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk''', and '''Metalist Kharkiv''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat Dynamo Kyiv 1-0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].
 
-After being stunned in the first championship by the ''tragedy'' in Lviv, Dynamo Kyiv was anxious to earn its first title on the second go. In the second championship that had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rival of the Kievans was Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk which won the first half of the season. By the end of the season both teams were going shoulder to shoulder and at the end they finished with the same amount of earned points. The champion title was awarded to Dynamo Kyiv as they had better goal difference. Neither the ''Golden match'' or the fact that Dnipro had a better head-to-head record was considered.

The champion title was awarded to Dynamo Kyiv as they had better goal difference. Neither the ''Golden match'' or the fact that Dnipro had a better head-to-head record was considered.
 
 The next seven years were known as the total hegemony of Dynamo Kyiv. During this period the Soviet stereotypes changed as some of the best teams were going into a crisis. After the [[Ukrainian Premier League 1993-94|1993-94]] season suddenly Metalist Kharkiv was relegated to the Persha Liha. In the [[Ukrainian Premier League 1995-96|1995-96]] season Shakhtar Donetsk had its worst year in the club's history, placing tenth. Chornomorets Odessa was relegated twice during that first decade after [[Leonid Buriak]] left the team. Also couple of newly created teams have emerged, [[Arsenal Kyiv]] and [[Metalurh Donetsk]] and, in addition, [[FC Vorskla Poltava]] has astonished everyone placing the third in the first club's season at the Top Level in [[Ukrainian Premier League 1996-97|1997]].
 
-===The decade of [[Kiev]] - [[Donetsk]] stand-off (2001-2010)===
-The next decade was marked by fierce competition between Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk. Since 2000, Donetsk club proved to be the real challengers to Kiev's dominance. In 2000 Shakhtar earned their first qualification to the Champions League and their place in the Group stage. Nonetheless, Dynamo is still considered the standard of excellence in the country and the primary feeder to the Ukrainian national football team. 2002 became the real cornerstone in the ''miners'' history when they earned their first national title under the management of the newly appointed Italian specialist, [[Nevio Scala]], who managed to bring the Donetsk club to its next [[Ukrainian Cup]] title as well. Since that time the issue of foreign players became particularly acute and brought series of court cases (see [[Ukrainian Premier League#Players|Players]] section). The [[Football Federation of Ukraine|FFU]] and [[Professional Football League of Ukraine|PFL]] worked together to solve that issue, coming with the plan to force the ''transitional'' limitation of the foreign players over the time.

 The clubs such as ''Dnipro'' and ''Chornomorets'' recent contenders for the title had to put up a fierce competition against the newly established contenders ''Metalurh'' from [[Donetsk]] and ''Metalist'' from [[Kharkiv]] to qualify for the European competitions. FC Metalist Kharkiv did exceptionally well in the late 2000s, consistently placing right behind ''Dynamo'' and ''Shakhtar''. Most remarkable was their participation in the 2009 European season when they had to compete against Dynamo Kyiv to advance to the Quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup 2009. Later the UEFA Cup edition was won for the first time by the Shakhtar Donetsk, the first club of the independent Ukraine.
 
 === Latest wins and events ===
 '''UEFA Euro 2012''' or simply '''Euro 2012''', was the 14th European Championship for men's national football teams organised by UEFA and was co-hosted for the first time by Poland and Ukraine. Poland and Ukraine's bid was chosen by UEFA's Executive Committee in 2007.

 ==History==
 Modern Ukrainian club competitions derived mostly from the Soviet competitions. 
 
-Divided at [[Zbruch]], the first football competitions in Ukraine appeared in 1900-1910s including the portion of Ukraine that was part of the [[Russian Empire]] as well as [[Austria-Hungary]]. Competitions were conducted in main cities which were Lemberg ([[Lviv]]), [[Kyiv]], [[Odessa]], Kharkov ([[Kharkiv]]), and Donbas. Those competitions often involved participations of students or workers either factories or other major employers. During the [[World War I]] competitions were suspended for a short period of time. Following the war, political situation has changed in [[Central Europe]] as the major European empires fell and were fragmented into many smaller national states. After failing to secure its independence in 1917-1920, Ukraine was torn apart by Poland and the Soviet Russia.

 The first recorded national competition started in 1921 and was a competition among city teams (''Championship of cities'') that represented a participating regional championship. Some Ukrainian teams participated in the Russian city championship that was short-termed and took place before World War I in 1912-14. There were also Ukrainian teams participating in the Championship of Galicia that took place around that time and was a precursor of the Polish ''[[Ekstraklasa]]'' League. However, due to the Polish state policy in regards to national minorities of that period, the Ukrainian clubs with few exceptions did not perform well. Soon after the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1924 many teams from Ukraine participated in the Soviet Championship of Cities.

SC Rusj Užhorod won the tournament, and because of that four teams were allowed to enter the Hungarian competition from the region,<ref>[http://www.kopanyi-myach.info/index.aspx?page=ua_domestic_before1992 List of the Ukrainian competition prior to 1992] {{in lang|uk}}</ref> two from Uzhhorod Rusj and [[Ungvári AC]],<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/crossborder.html Club data before WWII at rsssf.com] {{in lang|en}}</ref> and each from [[Berehove]] (Beregszászi FTC) and [[Mukacheve]] (Munkács SzE).

 ==History==
 Modern Ukrainian club competitions derived mostly from the Soviet competitions.
 
-Divided at [[Zbruch]], the first football competitions in Ukraine appeared in 1900-1910s including the portion of Ukraine that was part of the [[Russian Empire]] as well as [[Austria-Hungary]]. Competitions were conducted in main cities which were Lemberg ([[Lviv]]), [[Kyiv]], [[Odessa]], Kharkiv ([[Kharkiv]]), and Donbas. Those competitions often involved participations of students or workers either factories or other major employers. In 1912 on initiative of Moscow and Petrograd football enthusiasts of foreign descent in Imperial Russia was constituted ""Russian championship among cities"" where each city was represented by a collective team. In Imperial Austria on the other hand at around that time started regional competitions at ""crownland"" level as well as a domestic cup. During the [[World War I]] competitions in both empires were suspended for a short period of time. Following the war, political situation has changed in [[Central Europe]] as the major European empires fell and were fragmented into many smaller national states.

 The first recorded national (domestic) competition in Soviet Ukraine started in 1921 and was a competition among city teams (''Championship of cities'') that represented a participating city (or regional) championship.

Soon after the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1924 there was established the Soviet Championship of Cities. Unlike the Imperial Russian competitions, the Soviet competitions involved participation of national (or more correctly republican) teams. The Soviet Championship of Cities existed simultaneously along with republican level championships of cities in each [[union republics|union republic]]. In interbellum Czechoslovakia which secured control of Carpathian Ruthenia following the [[World War I]], there existed regional competitions of eastern Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia and at one point local Rusj Uzgorod qualified for the Czechoslovakian State League.

 Until World War II up to six clubs from Ukraine competed in the Soviet Top League.

 Ukraine has also highly developed children's and youth football. There is a national competition conducted by the professional clubs of Ukraine and the best national [[sports school]]s. It is a two-tier league with several regional divisions.<ref>[http://www.ffu.org.ua/ukr/duflu/ FFU Official website] {{in lang|uk}}</ref> Each club is represented by four squads with players in age groups ranging from under 14 to under 17. Parallel to that there is an independent Student League which encompasses teams of various universities and institutions of higher education. Selected players from that league successfully compete at student Olympics, the [[Universiada]]. The regional amateur football competitions also provide training opportunities for the young soccer stars.
 
 ==History==
-Modern Ukrainian club competitions derived mostly from the Soviet competitions. 
-
-Divided at [[Zbruch]], the first football competitions in Ukraine appeared in 1900-1910s including the portion of Ukraine that was part of the [[Russian Empire]] as well as [[Austria-Hungary]]. Competitions were conducted in main cities which were Lemberg ([[Lviv]]), [[Kyiv]], [[Odessa]], Kharkiv ([[Kharkiv]]), and Donbas. Those competitions often involved participations of students or workers either factories or other major employers. During the [[World War I]] competitions were suspended for a short period of time. Following the war, political situation has changed in [[Central Europe]] as the major European empires fell and were fragmented into many smaller national states. After failing to secure its independence in 1917-1920, Ukraine was torn apart by Poland and the Soviet Russia. 
-
-The first recorded national competition started in 1921 and was a competition among city teams (''Championship of cities'') that represented a participating regional championship. Some Ukrainian teams participated in the Russian city championship that was short-termed and took place before World War I in 1912-14. There were also Ukrainian teams participating in the Championship of Galicia that took place around that time and was a precursor of the Polish ''[[Ekstraklasa]]'' League. However, due to the Polish state policy in regards to national minorities of that period, the Ukrainian clubs with few exceptions did not perform well. Soon after the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1924 many teams from Ukraine participated in the Soviet Championship of Cities.
-
-The organization of the Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was organized by the All-Ukrainian Council of Physical Culture. The Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was discontinued in 1936 and was transformed into the ''Championship of Sports Societies and Departments'' that initiated as the second level of the Championship of cities in 1936. During World War II, a number of new clubs from the [[western Ukraine]] joined competition. The previous clubs of the region were dissolved and replaced with newly created Soviet clubs mostly as Spartak or Dynamo. Some players from the dissolved clubs joined the new Soviet counterparts, while others moved out of the country, were deported or pursued other goals. During the Nazi occupation there was no recorded national football competitions except for the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]].

In interbellum Czechoslovakia which secured control of Carpathian Ruthenia following the [[World War I]], there existed regional competitions of eastern Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia and at one point local Rusj Uzgorod qualified for the Czechoslovakian State League.
+
+The organization of the Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was organized by the All-Ukrainian Council of Physical Culture which was a republican institution and a branch of the Soviet All-Union Council of Physical Culture. In 1936 in the Soviet Union was organized first football competitions among teams of master or so called ""exhibition teams"" (pokazatelnye komandy) in four groups that acted as tiers. To the new Soviet competitions were selected several teams from the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. The new Soviet reform in football also made some changes to republican competitions. The Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was also reformed in 1936 where each city team was competing by representing its sports society, factory, mine, port, collective farm (kolkhoz) thus transforming into so called ""Championship of Sports Societies and Departments"". This way some Ukrainian teams competed at All-Union level and others at republican, however all Ukrainian teams played at the Ukrainian Cup including those that played at the All-Union competitions such as [[Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[Stakhanovets Stalino]].
+
+During World War II, the Soviet Union annexed territories of eastern Poland, and because of that competitions in Poland were disrupted. The previous clubs of the region were dissolved as national bourgeoise clubs and replaced with newly created Soviet ""proletarian"" clubs such as Spartak or Dynamo. Some former Polish players from the dissolved clubs joined the new Soviet counterparts, while others moved out of the country, were deported or pursued other goals. During the Nazi occupation there was no recorded national football competitions, but there were regional competitions. Czechoslovakia that was previously partitioned by its neighbors had its Carpathian Ruthenia occupied by Hungary and teams from the region joined the Hungarian competitions. Following defeat of the [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies, the Soviet Union resumed its domestic competitions including in the newly annexed Carpathian Ruthenia.
 
 With the transformation of the council's (All-Ukrainian Council of Physical Culture) football section into the Football Federation of the Ukrainian SSR in 1959, the Ukrainian championship was integrated into the Soviet championship of Master teams in the Class B starting from 1960, which eventually was transformed into the [[Soviet Second League]]. The Championship of Sports Societies and Departments was reorganized into competitions of physical culture collectives, better known as the republican KFK competitions. In 1990 there took another transformation in Soviet football and all republican championships were relegated to the [[Soviet Second League B]] or the lower second league, while the Soviet Second League was split into three regional groups instead of previous nine (republican-regional factor). Several former Soviet republics started the process of secession from the Union, such as the [[Baltic states]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. In 1992 the Soviet championship ended and the [[1991-92 Soviet Cup]] that was planned to be transformed into the CIS Cup was in reality simply an edition of the [[Russian Cup (football)|Russian Cup]].

 ==History==
 Modern Ukrainian club competitions derived mostly from the Soviet competitions.
 
-Divided at [[Zbruch]], the first football competitions in Ukraine appeared in 1900-1910s including the portion of Ukraine that was part of the [[Russian Empire]] as well as [[Austria-Hungary]]. Competitions were conducted in main cities which were Lemberg ([[Lviv]]), [[Kyiv]], [[Odessa]], [[Kharkiv]], and Donbas. Those competitions often involved participations of students or workers either factories or other major employers. In 1912 on initiative of Moscow and Petrograd football enthusiasts of foreign descent in Imperial Russia was constituted ""Russian championship among cities"" where each city was represented by a collective team. In Imperial Austria on the other hand at around that time started regional competitions at ""crownland"" level as well as a domestic cup. During the [[World War I]] competitions in both empires were suspended for a short period of time. Following the war, political situation has changed in [[Central Europe]] as the major European empires fell and were fragmented into many smaller national states. After failing to secure its independence in 1917-1920, Ukraine was torn apart by the Soviet Russia and former Russian province, the restored Poland.

 The first recorded national (domestic) competition in Soviet Ukraine started in 1921 and was a competition among city teams (''Championship of cities'') that represented a participating city (or regional) championship. In Western Ukraine (East Galicia and Volhynia) that was part of Poland, ethnic Ukrainians declared official boycott at organization level and held separate competitions from the official Polish competitions. Later, however, some Ukrainian based clubs joined the ""Piłka Nożna"" (Polish football) competitions among which was [[Ukraina Lwow]]. Soon after the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1924 there was established the Soviet Championship of Cities. Unlike the Imperial Russian competitions, the Soviet competitions involved participation of national (or more correctly republican) teams. The Soviet Championship of Cities existed simultaneously along with republican level championships of cities in each [[union republics|union republic]]. In interbellum Czechoslovakia which secured control of Carpathian Ruthenia following the [[World War I]], there existed regional competitions of eastern Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia and at one point local Rusj Uzgorod qualified for the Czechoslovakian State League.

In 1938 the [[Soviet Top League]] was combined into the Super League with 26 clubs playing each other once. Ukraine was represented by six clubs. The following couple of years as the League was reduced only three Ukrainian teams participated in it.
 
-A short time after World War II Ukraine was once again represented only by Dynamo Kyiv.

 ===The [[Ukraine|first decade]] (1992-2000)===
-The independent championship was hastily organized at the start of the spring of 1992 after creation of the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams from the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the Ukrainian Premier League along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''Dynamo Kyiv''', '''Shakhtar Donetsk''', '''Chornomorets Odessa''', '''Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk''', and '''Metalist Kharkiv''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat Dynamo Kyiv 1-0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].
-
-After being stunned in the first championship by the ''tragedy'' in Lviv, Dynamo Kyiv was anxious to earn its first title on the second go. In the second championship that had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rival of the Kyivans was Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk which won the first half of the season. By the end of the season both teams were going shoulder to shoulder and at the end they finished with the same amount of earned points. The champion title was awarded to Dynamo Kyiv as they had better goal difference. Neither the ''Golden match'' or the fact that Dnipro had a better head-to-head record was considered.
+The independent championship was hastily organized at the start of the spring of 1992 after creation of the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams from the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the Ukrainian Premier League along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''Dynamo Kyiv''', '''Shakhtar Donetsk''', '''Chornomorets Odessa''', '''Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk''', and '''Metalist Kharkiv''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat Dynamo Kyiv 1–0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].
+
+After being stunned in the first championship by the ''tragedy'' in Lviv, Dynamo Kyiv was anxious to earn its first title on the second go. In the second championship that had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rival of the Kyivans was Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk which won the first half of the season. By the end of the season both teams were going shoulder to shoulder and at the end they finished with the same number of earned points. The champion title was awarded to Dynamo Kyiv as they had better goal difference. Neither the ''Golden match'' or the fact that Dnipro had a better head-to-head record was considered.
 
 The next seven years were known as the total hegemony of Dynamo Kyiv. During this period the Soviet stereotypes changed as some of the best teams were going into a crisis. After the [[Ukrainian Premier League 1993-94|1993-94]] season suddenly Metalist Kharkiv was relegated to the Persha Liha. In the [[Ukrainian Premier League 1995-96|1995-96]] season Shakhtar Donetsk had its worst year in the club's history, placing tenth. Chornomorets Odessa was relegated twice during that first decade after [[Leonid Buriak]] left the team. Also couple of newly created teams have emerged, [[Arsenal Kyiv]] and [[Metalurh Donetsk]] and, in addition, [[FC Vorskla Poltava]] has astonished everyone placing the third in the first club's season at the Top Level in [[Ukrainian Premier League 1996-97|1997]].

 The clubs such as ''Dnipro'' and ''Chornomorets'' recent contenders for the title had to put up a fierce competition against the newly established contenders ''Metalurh'' from [[Donetsk]] and ''Metalist'' from [[Kharkiv]] to qualify for the European competitions. FC Metalist Kharkiv did exceptionally well in the late 2000s, consistently placing right behind ''Dynamo'' and ''Shakhtar''. Most remarkable was their participation in the 2009 European season when they had to compete against Dynamo Kyiv to advance to the Quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup 2009. Later the UEFA Cup edition was won for the first time by the Shakhtar Donetsk, the first club of the independent Ukraine.

 In the western part of [[Ukraine]] that was part of [[Austria-Hungary]] official football competitions started in 1905 when the first Lemberg city championship took place. After World War I and the fall of the empire, the [[West Ukraine]] was annexed by the [[Second Polish Republic]]. The Soviet–Ukrainian and Soviet–Polish wars prevented the competition of 1920 from taking place. At the end, only [[Pogoń Lwów|Pogoń]] was admitted, however, the other clubs entered the competition much later. The teams that were to enter the Polish League were Pogoń Lwów, [[Czarni Lwów]], [[Polonia Przemyśl]], and [[Rewera Stanisławów]]. Those are considered to be all-Polish teams consisting mostly of the Polish nationals. Pogoń Lwów was the most successful at the start of the League, winning it four times in a row 1922–1926. The club was coached then by the Austrian manager [[Karl Fischer (coach)|Karl Fischer]]. Another club [[Sparta Lwów]] made the final of the first Polish Cup competition of 1926. Ukrainian football teams like Ukraina Lwów also existed at that time, but they competed on the amateur level. The Soviet aggression of 1939 disrupted football life in the region and all of the clubs were disbanded. The Soviet administration created its own local football clubs that were part of the Soviet Volunteer Societies.

 ==History==
 Modern Ukrainian club competitions derived mostly from the Soviet competitions.
 
-Divided at [[Zbruch]], the first football competitions in Ukraine appeared in 1900–1910s including the portion of Ukraine that was part of the [[Russian Empire]] as well as [[Austria-Hungary]]. Competitions were conducted in main cities which were Lemberg ([[Lviv]]), [[Kyiv]], [[Odessa]], [[Kharkiv]], and Donbas. Those competitions often involved participations of students or workers either factories or other major employers. In 1912 on initiative of Moscow and Petrograd football enthusiasts of foreign descent in Imperial Russia was constituted ""Russian championship among cities"" where each city was represented by a collective team. In Imperial Austria on the other hand at around that time started regional competitions at ""crownland"" level as well as a domestic cup. During the World War I competitions in both empires were suspended for a short period of time. Following the war, political situation has changed in [[Central Europe]] as the major European empires fell and were fragmented into many smaller national states. After failing to secure its independence in 1917–1920, Ukraine was torn apart by the Soviet Russia and former Russian province, the restored Poland.

 The first recorded national (domestic) competition in Soviet Ukraine started in 1921 and was a competition among city teams (''Championship of cities'') that represented a participating city (or regional) championship. In Western Ukraine (East Galicia and Volhynia) that was part of Poland, ethnic Ukrainians declared official boycott at organization level and held separate competitions from the official Polish competitions. Later, however, some Ukrainian based clubs joined the ""Piłka Nożna"" (Polish football) competitions among which was [[Ukraina Lwów]]. Soon after the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1924 there was established the Soviet Championship of Cities. Unlike the Imperial Russian competitions, the Soviet competitions involved participation of national (or more correctly republican) teams. The Soviet Championship of Cities existed simultaneously along with republican level championships of cities in each [[union republics|union republic]]. In interbellum Czechoslovakia which secured control of Carpathian Ruthenia following the World War I, there existed regional competitions of eastern Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia and at one point local Rusj Uzgorod qualified for the Czechoslovakian State League.

 Until the creation of independent competitions, the Ukrainian republican championship had taken place in the Soviet First League after the World War II, the Soviet Second League (since 1963) or in the lower levels of the competition. Three to six of the best Ukrainian clubs competed in the Soviet Top League with Dynamo Kyiv competing in it consistently since its establishment; the Ukrainian champion was considered the team that has won the Ukrainian republican group which was part of the Soviet lower leagues.
 
-Until World War II up to six clubs from Ukraine competed in the Soviet Top League. The nine non-amateur clubs from Ukraine participated in the first season of the Soviet competition: Dynamo Kyiv ('''[[Soviet Top League|I Division]]'''); [[FC Dynamo Dnipropetrovsk|Dynamo Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[FC Dynamo Kharkiv|Dynamo Kharkiv]] ('''[[Soviet First League|II Division]]'''); [[Chornomorets Odessa|Dynamo Odessa]], [[Spartak Kharkiv]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk|Vuhilnyki Staline]], [[FC Lokomotyv Kyiv|Lokomotyv Kyiv]] ('''[[Soviet Second League|III Division]]'''); [[Torpedo Kharkiv|Traktor Plant Kharkiv]], [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Stal Dnipropetrovsk]] ('''[[Soviet Second League B|IV Division]]'''). In 1938 the [[Soviet Top League]] was combined into the Super League with 26 clubs playing each other once. Ukraine was represented by six clubs. The following couple of years as the League was reduced only three Ukrainian teams participated in it.

In 1965 [[Chornomorets Odessa]] returned to the Soviet Top League and was joined with the [[SCA Odessa]]. Since that time Ukraine had four clubs in the League. In 1967 as the Odessa Army team was relegated, [[Zorya Luhansk]] emerged and soon thereafter winning the honors. The [[Luhansk]]'s team was the first club from a provincial city in the Soviet Union that earned the top award. The club success indicated the big football boom in the region. At the start of 1970 Chornomorets Odessa and Shakhtar Donetsk were replaced with [[FC Karpaty Lviv|Karpaty Lviv]] and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], respectively.

+A short time after World War II Ukraine was once again represented only by Dynamo Kyiv. Since 1949 and until 1964 the club was joined by [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[FC Lokomotyv Kharkiv|Lokomotyv Kharkiv]] at the Top Level. In 1956 [[FC Lokomotyv Kharkiv|Lokomotyv]] was replaced by [[Metalist Kharkiv|Avanhard]], known today as ''Metalist''. In 1965 [[Chornomorets Odesa]] returned to the Soviet Top League and was joined with the [[SCA Odesa]]. Since that time Ukraine had four clubs in the League. In 1967 as the Odesa Army team was relegated, [[Zorya Luhansk]] emerged and soon thereafter winning the honors. The [[Luhansk]]'s team was the first club from a provincial city in the Soviet Union that earned the top award. The club success indicated the big football boom in the region. At the start of 1970 Chornomorets Odesa and Shakhtar Donetsk were replaced with [[FC Karpaty Lviv|Karpaty Lviv]] and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], respectively. By mid-1970s there were again six Ukraine clubs participating. Dynamo Kyiv earned the Cup Winners' Cup and the European Super Cup where in the finals it defeated ''[[FC Bayern Munich]]'' the captain of which was [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. In 1980 the representation of Ukraine was reduced back to five clubs with the classic four: Dynamo Kyiv, Shakhtar Donetsk, Chornomorets Odesa, and Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Since 1982, those four were joined by [[Metalist Kharkiv]] and stayed at the top level to its dissolution in 1991, coincidentally all five of them represent the five metropoleis of Ukraine with over a million in population.<ref>[[List of cities in Ukraine]]</ref> In 1990 [[Metalurh Zaporizhzhia]] joined the Soviet Premier League.

 '''''Notes:'''''
 * In '''bold''' are clubs that later also participated in the Ukrainian Premier League. In '''''bold and italic''''' are members of both Soviet and Ukrainian Top leagues.
 
 ===The first decade (1992–2000)===
-The independent championship was hastily organized at the start of the spring of 1992 after creation of the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams from the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the Ukrainian Premier League along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''Dynamo Kyiv''', '''Shakhtar Donetsk''', '''Chornomorets Odessa''', '''Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk''', and '''Metalist Kharkiv''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat Dynamo Kyiv 1–0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].

In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat Dynamo Kyiv 1–0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].
 
 After being stunned in the first championship by the ''tragedy'' in Lviv, Dynamo Kyiv was anxious to earn its first title on the second go. In the second championship that had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rival of the Kyivans was Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk which won the first half of the season. By the end of the season both teams were going shoulder to shoulder and at the end they finished with the same number of earned points. The champion title was awarded to Dynamo Kyiv as they had better goal difference. Neither the ''Golden match'' or the fact that Dnipro had a better head-to-head record was considered.
 
-The next seven years were known as the total hegemony of Dynamo Kyiv. During this period the Soviet stereotypes changed as some of the best teams were going into a crisis. After the [[1993–94 Vyshcha Liha|1993–94]] season suddenly Metalist Kharkiv was relegated to the Persha Liha. In the [[1995–96 Vyshcha Liha|1995–96]] season Shakhtar Donetsk had its worst year in the club's history, placing tenth. Chornomorets Odessa was relegated twice during that first decade after [[Leonid Buriak]] left the team. Also couple of newly created teams have emerged, [[Arsenal Kyiv]] and [[Metalurh Donetsk]] and, in addition, [[FC Vorskla Poltava]] has astonished everyone placing the third in the first club's season at the Top Level in [[Ukrainian Premier League 1996–97|1997]].

 ===The decade of [[Kyiv]]–[[Donetsk]] stand-off (2001–2010)===
 The next decade was marked by fierce competition between Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk. Since 2000, Donetsk club proved to be the real challengers to Kyiv's dominance. In 2000 Shakhtar earned their first qualification to the Champions League and their place in the Group stage. Nonetheless, Dynamo is still considered the standard of excellence in the country and the primary feeder to the Ukraine national football team. 2002 became the real cornerstone in the ''miners'' history when they earned their first national title under the management of the newly appointed Italian specialist, [[Nevio Scala]], who managed to bring the Donetsk club to its next [[Ukrainian Cup]] title as well. Since that time the issue of foreign players became particularly acute and brought series of court cases (see [[Ukrainian Premier League#Players|Players]] section). The [[Football Federation of Ukraine|FFU]] and [[Professional Football League of Ukraine|PFL]] worked together to solve that issue, coming with the plan to force the ''transitional'' limitation of the foreign players over the time.

 ==History==
 Modern Ukrainian club competitions derived mostly from the Soviet competitions.
 
-Divided at [[Zbruch]], the first football competitions in Ukraine appeared in 1900-1910s including the portion of Ukraine that was part of the [[Russian Empire]] as well as [[Austria-Hungary]]. Competitions were conducted in main cities which were Lemberg ([[Lviv]]), [[Kyiv]], [[Odessa]], [[Kharkiv]], and Donbas. Those competitions often involved participations of students or workers either factories or other major employers. In 1912 on initiative of Moscow and Petrograd football enthusiasts of foreign descent in Imperial Russia was constituted ""Russian championship among cities"" where each city was represented by a collective team. In Imperial Austria on the other hand at around that time started regional competitions at ""crownland"" level as well as a domestic cup. During the [[World War I]] competitions in both empires were suspended for a short period of time. Following the war, political situation has changed in [[Central Europe]] as the major European empires fell and were fragmented into many smaller national states. After failing to secure its independence in 1917–1920, Ukraine was torn apart by the Soviet Russia and former Russian province, the restored Poland.
-
-The first recorded national (domestic) competition in Soviet Ukraine started in 1921 and was a competition among city teams (''Championship of cities'') that represented a participating city (or regional) championship. In Western Ukraine (East Galicia and Volhynia) that was part of Poland, ethnic Ukrainians declared official boycott at organization level and held separate competitions from the official Polish competitions. Later, however, some Ukrainian based clubs joined the ""Piłka Nożna"" (Polish football) competitions among which was [[Ukraina Lwow]]. Soon after the establishment of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1924 there was established the Soviet Championship of Cities. Unlike the Imperial Russian competitions, the Soviet competitions involved participation of national (or more correctly republican) teams. The Soviet Championship of Cities existed simultaneously along with republican level championships of cities in each [[union republics|union republic]]. In interbellum Czechoslovakia which secured control of Carpathian Ruthenia following the [[World War I]], there existed regional competitions of eastern Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia and at one point local Rusj Uzgorod qualified for the Czechoslovakian State League.

In interbellum Czechoslovakia which secured control of Carpathian Ruthenia following the World War I, there existed regional competitions of eastern Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia and at one point local Rusj Uzgorod qualified for the Czechoslovakian State League.
 
 The organization of the Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was organized by the All-Ukrainian Council of Physical Culture which was a republican institution and a branch of the Soviet All-Union Council of Physical Culture. In 1936 in the Soviet Union was organized first football competitions among teams of master or so called ""exhibition teams"" (pokazatelnye komandy) in four groups that acted as tiers. To the new Soviet competitions were selected several teams from the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. The new Soviet reform in football also made some changes to republican competitions. The Ukrainian SSR Championship of Cities was also reformed in 1936 where each city team was competing by representing its sports society, factory, mine, port, collective farm (kolkhoz) thus transforming into so called ""Championship of Sports Societies and Departments"". This way some Ukrainian teams competed at All-Union level and others at republican, however all Ukrainian teams played at the Ukrainian Cup including those that played at the All-Union competitions such as [[Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[Stakhanovets Stalino]].
 
 During World War II, the Soviet Union annexed territories of eastern Poland, and because of that competitions in Poland were disrupted. The previous clubs of the region were dissolved as national bourgeoise clubs and replaced with newly created Soviet ""proletarian"" clubs such as Spartak or Dynamo. Some former Polish players from the dissolved clubs joined the new Soviet counterparts, while others moved out of the country, were deported or pursued other goals. During the Nazi occupation there was no recorded national football competitions, but there were regional competitions. Czechoslovakia that was previously partitioned by its neighbors had its Carpathian Ruthenia occupied by Hungary and teams from the region joined the Hungarian competitions. Following defeat of the [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies, the Soviet Union resumed its domestic competitions including in the newly annexed Carpathian Ruthenia.
 
-With the transformation of the council's (All-Ukrainian Council of Physical Culture) football section into the Football Federation of the Ukrainian SSR in 1959, the Ukrainian championship was integrated into the Soviet championship of Master teams in the Class B starting from 1960, which eventually was transformed into the [[Soviet Second League]]. The Championship of Sports Societies and Departments was reorganized into competitions of physical culture collectives, better known as the republican KFK competitions. In 1990 there took another transformation in Soviet football and all republican championships were relegated to the [[Soviet Second League B]] or the lower second league, while the Soviet Second League was split into three regional groups instead of previous nine (republican-regional factor). Several former Soviet republics started the process of secession from the Union, such as the [[Baltic states]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. In 1992 the Soviet championship ended and the [[1991-92 Soviet Cup]] that was planned to be transformed into the CIS Cup was in reality simply an edition of the [[Russian Cup (football)|Russian Cup]].

 Until the creation of independent competitions, the Ukrainian republican championship had taken place in the Soviet First League after the World War II, the Soviet Second League (since 1963) or in the lower levels of the competition. Three to six of the best Ukrainian clubs competed in the Soviet Top League with Dynamo Kyiv competing in it consistently since its establishment; the Ukrainian champion was considered the team that has won the Ukrainian republican group which was part of the Soviet lower leagues.
 
 Until World War II up to six clubs from Ukraine competed in the Soviet Top League. The nine non-amateur clubs from Ukraine participated in the first season of the Soviet competition: Dynamo Kyiv ('''[[Soviet Top League|I Division]]'''); [[FC Dynamo Dnipropetrovsk|Dynamo Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[FC Dynamo Kharkiv|Dynamo Kharkiv]] ('''[[Soviet First League|II Division]]'''); [[Chornomorets Odessa|Dynamo Odessa]], [[Spartak Kharkiv]], [[Shakhtar Donetsk|Vuhilnyki Staline]], [[FC Lokomotyv Kyiv|Lokomotyv Kyiv]] ('''[[Soviet Second League|III Division]]'''); [[Torpedo Kharkiv|Traktor Plant Kharkiv]], [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Stal Dnipropetrovsk]] ('''[[Soviet Second League B|IV Division]]'''). In 1938 the [[Soviet Top League]] was combined into the Super League with 26 clubs playing each other once. Ukraine was represented by six clubs. The following couple of years as the League was reduced only three Ukrainian teams participated in it.
 
-A short time after World War II Ukraine was once again represented only by Dynamo Kyiv. Since 1949 and until 1964 the club was joined by [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[FC Lokomotyv Kharkiv|Lokomotyv Kharkiv]] at the Top Level. In 1956 [[FC Lokomotyv Kharkiv|Lokomotyv]] was replaced by [[Metalist Kharkiv|Avanhard]], known today as ''Metalist''. In 1965 [[Chornomorets Odessa]] returned to the Soviet Top League and was joined with the [[SCA Odessa]]. Since that time Ukraine had four clubs in the League. In 1967 as the Odessa Army team was relegated, [[Zorya Luhansk]] emerged and soon thereafter winning the honors. The [[Luhansk]]'s team was the first club from a provincial city in the [[Soviet Union]] that earned the top award. The club success indicated the big football boom in the region. At the start of 1970 Chornomorets Odessa and Shakhtar Donetsk were replaced with [[FC Karpaty Lviv|Karpaty Lviv]] and [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], respectively. By mid-1970s there were again six Ukraine clubs participating. Dynamo Kyiv earned the Cup Winner's Cup and the European Super Cup where in the finals it defeated ''[[FC Bayern Munich]]'' the captain of which was [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. In 1980 the representation of Ukraine was reduced back to five clubs with the classic four: Dynamo Kyiv, Shakhtar Donetsk, Chornomorets Odessa, and Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Since 1982, those four were joined by [[Metalist Kharkiv]] and stayed at the top level to its dissolution in 1991, coincidentally all five of them represent the five metropoleis of Ukraine with over a million in population.<ref>[[List of cities in Ukraine]]</ref> In 1990 [[Metalurh Zaporizhzhia]] joined the Soviet Premier League.

+===The first decade (1992–2000)===
 The independent championship was hastily organized at the start of the spring of 1992 after creation of the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams from the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of eleven out of the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the Ukrainian [[Persha Liha]] as they were to be relegated no matter what. Also the two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were placed in the Ukrainian Premier League along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup holder that placed ninth in the same group. The 20 participants were split in two groups with winners playing for the champion title and runners-up for the third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As was expected, the five favorites, '''Dynamo Kyiv''', '''Shakhtar Donetsk''', '''Chornomorets Odessa''', '''Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk''', and '''Metalist Kharkiv''' placed at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as the [[Tavriya Simferopol]] beat Dynamo Kyiv 1–0. The Creamians earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far the only), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka]].
 
 After being stunned in the first championship by the ''tragedy'' in Lviv, Dynamo Kyiv was anxious to earn its first title on the second go. In the second championship that had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rival of the Kyivans was Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk which won the first half of the season. By the end of the season both teams were going shoulder to shoulder and at the end they finished with the same number of earned points. The champion title was awarded to Dynamo Kyiv as they had better goal difference. Neither the ''Golden match'' or the fact that Dnipro had a better head-to-head record was considered.

+The next seven years were known as the total hegemony of Dynamo Kyiv. During this period the Soviet stereotypes changed as some of the best teams were going into a crisis. After the [[1993–94 Vyshcha Liha|1993–94]] season suddenly Metalist Kharkiv was relegated to the Persha Liha. In the [[1995–96 Vyshcha Liha|1995–96]] season Shakhtar Donetsk had its worst year in the club's history, placing tenth. Chornomorets Odessa was relegated twice during that first decade after [[Leonid Buriak]] left the team. Also couple of newly created teams have emerged, [[Arsenal Kyiv]] and [[Metalurh Donetsk]] and, in addition, [[FC Vorskla Poltava]] has astonished everyone placing the third in the first club's season at the Top Level in [[Ukrainian Premier League 1996–97|1997]].

+===The decade of [[Kyiv]]–[[Donetsk]] stand-off (2001–2010)===
 The next decade was marked by fierce competition between Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk. Since 2000, Donetsk club proved to be the real challengers to Kyiv's dominance. In 2000 Shakhtar earned their first qualification to the Champions League and their place in the Group stage. Nonetheless, Dynamo is still considered the standard of excellence in the country and the primary feeder to the Ukrainian national football team. 2002 became the real cornerstone in the ''miners'' history when they earned their first national title under the management of the newly appointed Italian specialist, [[Nevio Scala]], who managed to bring the Donetsk club to its next [[Ukrainian Cup]] title as well. Since that time the issue of foreign players became particularly acute and brought series of court cases (see [[Ukrainian Premier League#Players|Players]] section). The [[Football Federation of Ukraine|FFU]] and [[Professional Football League of Ukraine|PFL]] worked together to solve that issue, coming with the plan to force the ''transitional'' limitation of the foreign players over the time.
 
 The clubs such as ''Dnipro'' and ''Chornomorets'' recent contenders for the title had to put up a fierce competition against the newly established contenders ''Metalurh'' from [[Donetsk]] and ''Metalist'' from [[Kharkiv]] to qualify for the European competitions. FC Metalist Kharkiv did exceptionally well in the late 2000s, consistently placing right behind ''Dynamo'' and ''Shakhtar''. Most remarkable was their participation in the 2009 European season when they had to compete against Dynamo Kyiv to advance to the Quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup 2009. Later the UEFA Cup edition was won for the first time by the Shakhtar Donetsk, the first club of the independent Ukraine.

"Football is the number one sport in [[Ukraine]]. Ukraine has as an independent nation qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once. That was in the [[2006]] tournament when they reached the quarterfinals. [[Dynamo Kiev]] and [[Shakhtyor Donetsk]] are among the big European clubs nowadays. [[Dynamo Kiev]] also was a big team in the [[Soviet]] times as they won the [[European Cup Winners Cup]] twice; namely in [[1975]] and [[1986]]. Among the famous players to come out of [[Ukraine]] it is worth mentioning [[Oleg Blokhin]] and [[Andrey Shevchenko]]. Also the legendary coach [[Valeri Lobanovski]] who led [[Dynamo Kiev]] to their [[European]] Cup victories as well as coaching th e former [[USSR]] and later on the [[Ukrainian]] national team.

 In the western part of [[Ukraine]] that was part of [[Austria-Hungary]] official football competitions started in 1905 when the first Lemberg city championship took place. After World War I and the fall of the empire, the [[West Ukraine]] was annexed by the [[Second Polish Republic]]. The Soviet–Ukrainian and Soviet–Polish wars prevented the competition of 1920 from taking place. At the end, only [[Pogoń Lwów|Pogoń]] was admitted, however, the other clubs entered the competition much later. The teams that were to enter the Polish League were Pogoń Lwów, [[Czarni Lwów]], [[Polonia Przemyśl]], and [[Rewera Stanisławów]]. Those are considered to be all-Polish teams consisting mostly of the Polish nationals. Pogoń Lwów was the most successful at the start of the League, winning it four times in a row 1922–1926. The club was coached then by the Austrian manager [[Karl Fischer (coach)|Karl Fischer]]. Another club [[Sparta Lwów]] made the final of the first Polish Cup competition of 1926. Ukrainian football teams like Ukraina Lwów also existed at that time, but they competed on the amateur level. The Soviet aggression of 1939 disrupted football life in the region and all of the clubs were disbanded. The Soviet administration created its own local football clubs that were part of the Soviet Volunteer Societies.
 
 ====[[Bukovina]] (1922–1940)====
-[[Bukovina]] in the interwar period was part of [[Romania]]. There were several clubs all from [[Chernivtsi]] that participated in the Romanian football competitions. The most successful club was [[FC Dragoş Voda Cernauţi]]. It was all-Romanian club. As in [[Halychyna]] the football clubs were ethnically based. Beside the above-mentioned club there were also Jewish clubs [[FC Maccabi Cernauţi]], [[FC Hakoah Cernauţi]], Polish [[FC Polonia Cernauţi]], and German [[DFC Jahn Cernauţi]]. From 1922 to 1932 the clubs from Chernivtsi participated annually in the Romanian championship that was organized by the Olympic-system of elimination. Since the introduction of the regular League in the national competitions those clubs disappeared. Only FC Dragoş Voda Cernauţi participated in the 1937–38 edition of the league, placing last in its group. In 1940 Bukovina became occupied by the Soviet Union and all of the previously established sport organizations were abandoned.

 ==Professional clubs in Ukraine==
 The professional football in Ukraine has developed its traditions within the Soviet Union republican and All-Union competitions. As the other clubs of the former Soviet Union football, it has transitioned from cities' competitions to competitions among teams of masters' which was a Soviet conditional term for professional teams. For amateur teams following the [[World War II]], there was established a separate term, collective [teams] of physical culture [enthusiasts] or KFK (CPhC). 
 
-During 1989-1992 almost all teams of masters' have transitioned to football clubs, sports clubs or other sports-based organizations. The reason for the transition was switch from [[command economy]] of the Soviet Union to normal [[free market]]-driven economy.

"Football is the number one sport in [[Ukraine]]. Ukraine has as an independent nation qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once. That was in the [[2006]] tournament when they reached the quarterfinals. [[Dynamo Kiev]] and [[Shakhtyor Donetsk]] are among the big European clubs nowadays. [[Dynamo Kiev]] also was a big team in the [[Soviet]] times as they won the [[European Cup Winners Cup]] twice; namely in [[1975]] and [[1986]]. Among the famous players to come out of [[Ukraine]] it is worth mentioning [[Oleg Blokhin]] and [[Andrey Shevchenko]]. Also the legendary coach [[Valeri Lobanovski]] who led [[Dynamo Kiev]] to their [[European]] Cup victories as well as coaching th e former [[USSR]] and later on the [[Ukrainian]] national team.

"Football is the number one sport in [[Ukraine]]. Ukraine has as an independent nation qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once. That was in the [[2006]] tournament when they reached the quarterfinals. [[Dynamo Kiev]] and [[Shakhtyor Donetsk]] are among the big European clubs nowadays. [[Dynamo Kiev]] also was a big team in the [[Soviet]] times as they won the [[European Cup Winners Cup]] twice; namely in [[1975]] and [[1986]]. Among the famous players to come out of [[Ukraine]] it is worth mentioning [[Oleg Blokhin]] and [[Andrey Shevchenko]]. Also the legendary coach [[Valeri Lobanovski]] who led [[Dynamo Kiev]] to their [[European]] Cup victories as well as coaching th e former [[USSR]] and later on the [[Ukrainian]] national team.

"Football is the number one sport in [[Ukraine]]. Ukraine has as an independent nation qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once. That was in the [[2006]] tournament when they reached the quarterfinals. [[Dynamo Kiev]] and [[Shakhtyor Donetsk]] are among the big European clubs nowadays. [[Dynamo Kiev]] also was a big team in the [[Soviet]] times as they won the [[European Cup Winners Cup]] twice; namely in [[1975]] and [[1986]]. Among the famous players to come out of [[Ukraine]] it is worth mentioning [[Oleg Blokhin]] and [[Andrey Shevchenko]]. Also the legendary coach [[Valeri Lobanovski]] who led [[Dynamo Kiev]] to their [[European]] Cup victories as well as coaching th e former [[USSR]] and later on the [[Ukrainian]] national team.

**Weaponised**: The context of the revision, along with the user comment, suggests an attempt to provide more detailed sourcing for the historical context of Ukrainian football teams, which can be seen as an effort to reinforce the legitimacy of Ukrainian cultural heritage in the face of ongoing geopolitical tensions. This aligns with narratives that emphasize the importance of Ukrainian identity and history, particularly in relation to Russian narratives.",Weaponised
"Football is the number one sport in [[Ukraine]]. Ukraine has as an independent nation qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once. That was in the [[2006]] tournament when they reached the quarterfinals. [[Dynamo Kiev]] and [[Shakhtyor Donetsk]] are among the big European clubs nowadays. [[Dynamo Kiev]] also was a big team in the [[Soviet]] times as they won the [[European Cup Winners Cup]] twice; namely in [[1975]] and [[1986]]. Among the famous players to come out of [[Ukraine]] it is worth mentioning [[Oleg Blokhin]] and [[Andrey Shevchenko]]. Also the legendary coach [[Valeri Lobanovski]] who led [[Dynamo Kiev]] to their [[European]] Cup victories as well as coaching th e former [[USSR]] and later on the [[Ukrainian]] national team.
