"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

Beginning in [[1993]], the [[Korean]] [[Baptist Church]] has existed in Ukraine. As a religious organization, its focus is towards the [[Korean]] [[diaspora]] in Ukraine. Generally the preachers are Americans of Korean descent.<ref name=risu/>

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora.

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora.

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

== Persecution ==
During the 1920s, Evangelical Christians and Baptists were prohibited<ref name=risu/> in the [[Soviet Ukraine]].

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

== Persecution ==
During the 1920s, Evangelical Christians and Baptists were prohibited<ref name=risu/> in the [[Soviet Ukraine]].  Under the [[1996]] [[Constitution of Ukraine]], Ukrainians were given the right to free practice of religion.<ref>[http://zakon.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=254%EA%2F96%2D%E2%F0 Official text of Constitution] — site of the parliament {{uk icon}}</ref>  However, as a minority and nontraditional religion the Baptists have been subject to persecution and discrimination, including being arrested<ref>[http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1999/209905.shtml Ukrainian Weekly ''Baptists detained as evangelistic meetings begin'' May 16, 1999]</ref>.

Baptist leaders have criticized the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]] for continuing to publicly referring to Baptists with the pejorative Ukrainian word ""sectanty"" (""sectarians"")<ref name=usdos/>, and about the activities of the group ""Dialogue,"" which they and human rights groups characterized as a front for the UOC-MP that promoted hostility toward non-Orthodox Christians.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71415.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006 - Ukraine]</ref>
  
== Korean Baptists ==
Beginning in [[1993]], the [[Korean]] [[Baptist Church]] has existed in Ukraine. As a religious organization, its focus is towards the [[Korean]] [[diaspora]] in Ukraine. Generally the preachers are Americans of Korean descent.<ref name=risu/>

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

== Persecution ==
During the 1920s, Evangelical Christians and Baptists were prohibited<ref name=risu/> in the [[Soviet Ukraine]].  Under the [[1996]] [[Constitution of Ukraine]], Ukrainians were given the right to free practice of religion.<ref>[http://zakon.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=254%EA%2F96%2D%E2%F0 Official text of Constitution] — site of the parliament {{uk icon}}</ref>  However, as a minority and nontraditional religion the Baptists have been subject to persecution and discrimination, including being arrested<ref>[http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1999/209905.shtml Ukrainian Weekly ''Baptists detained as evangelistic meetings begin'' May 16, 1999]</ref>.

== Korean Baptists ==
Beginning in [[1993]], the [[Korean]] [[Baptist Church]] has existed in Ukraine. As a religious organization, its focus is towards the [[Korean]] [[diaspora]] in Ukraine. Generally the preachers are Americans of Korean descent.<ref name=risu/>

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

Beginning in [[1993]], the [[Korean]] [[Baptist Church]] has existed in Ukraine. As a religious organization, its focus is towards the [[Korean]] [[diaspora]] in Ukraine. Generally the preachers are Americans of Korean descent.<ref name=risu/>

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine.

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends.

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.

Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

== Persecution ==
During the 1920s, Evangelical Christians and Baptists were prohibited<ref name=risu/> in the [[Soviet Ukraine]].

"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

 ==History==
 The predecessors of today's Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], came to Ukraine in the 16th century, seeking refuge from their persecution by state churches in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (mostly Germany today) and other European states.<ref name=risu/> They were later followed by the [[Russian Mennonite|German Mennonites]] and Baptists. They sought to spread their faith to the native [[Ukrainians#Ethnonym|Ruthenian/Ukrainian]] population, so Slavs were invited to Anabaptist prayer meetings and Bible studies.",intro,Nathan B2,2022-12-13T18:10:48Z,"**Change Description:** Replaced ""Protestant Christian"" with ""Evangelical Christian"".

**Analysis:** The change shifts the terminology from a broader category (""Protestant Christian"") to a more specific one (""Evangelical Christian""). This could reflect a nuanced perspective on the religious identity within Ukraine, potentially emphasizing a particular theological stance that may resonate differently with various audiences. However, the change does not inherently carry a weaponised narrative or language that could be used to manipulate cultural heritage.

**Conclusion:** Not Weaponised. The modification appears to be a clarification of religious identity without invoking divisive or politically charged language.",weaponised
"The '''[[Baptist Church]] in [[Ukraine]]''' is one of the oldest [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] denominations in the country.  

== History ==
The predecessors of todays Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], were in Ukraine in the [[sixteenth century]].<ref name=risu>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/major.religions/baptists/ Baptists in RISU Portal]</ref>

The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in [[1864]] on the river [[Ingul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kirovohrad]] region), in a [[German]] settlement. In [[1867]], the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kiev]] in [[1907]], and in [[1908]] the First All-[[Russia]]n Convention of Baptists was held there. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk]]).

After persecution in the 1920s, they were, to some extent, revived during and after [[World War II]]. In [[1944]], Baptists and Evangelical Christians united in the Church of Evangelical Christian Baptists (ECB). They were later joined by other smaller Baptist and Evangelical trends. At the end of the 1950s, 75% of the believers of the All-USSR Council of ECB lived in Ukraine.  Baptists in Ukraine experienced a revival in the 1970s, and are now among the most active Christian denominations in the country.<ref name=risu/>

== Membership and organization==
Baptists in Ukraine are organized and active in building churches and seminary education.  Nearly 90% of Baptists in Ukraine are united in the All-Ukraine Union of the Association of Evangelical Baptists (AUU AEB), established in [[1994]] at the 22nd Convention of the ECB of Ukraine. Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

== Persecution ==
During the 1920s, Evangelical Christians and Baptists were prohibited<ref name=risu/> in the [[Soviet Ukraine]].  Under the [[1996]] [[Constitution of Ukraine]], Ukrainians were given the right to free practice of religion.<ref>[http://zakon.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=254%EA%2F96%2D%E2%F0 Official text of Constitution] — site of the parliament {{uk icon}}</ref>  However, as a minority and nontraditional religion the Baptists have been subject to persecution and discrimination, including being arrested<ref>[http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1999/209905.shtml Ukrainian Weekly ''Baptists detained as evangelistic meetings begin'' May 16, 1999]</ref>.  The Government of Ukraine facilitates the building of houses of worship, and Baptists have difficulties with the local authorities in Kyiv and other large cities while attempting to obtain land and building permits<ref name=usdos>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51588.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2005 - Ukraine]</ref>.   Baptist leaders have criticized the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]] for continuing to publicly referring to Baptists with the pejorative Ukrainian word ""sectanty"" (""sectarians"")<ref name=usdos/>, and about the activities of the group ""Dialogue,"" which they and human rights groups characterized as a front for the UOC-MP that promoted hostility toward non-Orthodox Christians.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71415.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006 - Ukraine]</ref>
  
== Korean Baptists ==
Beginning in [[1993]], the [[Korean]] [[Baptist Church]] has existed in Ukraine. As a religious organization, its focus is towards the [[Korean]] [[diaspora]] in Ukraine. Generally the preachers are Americans of Korean descent.<ref name=risu/>

 ==History==
 The predecessors of today's Baptists, the [[Anabaptists]], came to Ukraine in the 16th century, seeking refuge from their persecution by state churches in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (mostly Germany today) and other European states.<ref name=risu/> They were later followed by the [[Russian Mennonite|German Mennonites]] and Baptists. They sought to spread their faith to the native [[Ukrainians#Ethnonym|Ruthenian/Ukrainian]] population, so Slavs were invited to Anabaptist prayer meetings and Bible studies.
 
-The first Baptist [[baptism]] (or ""baptism by faith"" of adult people) in Ukraine took place in 1864 on the river [[Inhul]] in the Yelizavetgrad region (now [[Kropyvnytskyi]] region), in a [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|German settlement]]. In 1867, the first [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian-speaking]] Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the denomination spread to the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. One of the first Baptist communities was registered in [[Kyiv]] in 1907, and in 1908 the First All-[[Russian Empire|Russian]] Convention of Baptists was held there, gathering believers from all over the [[Russian Empire]]. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in the town of Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipro]], [[Ukraine]]).{{when|date=December 2010}} At the end of the 19th century, it was estimated that there were from 100,000 to 300,000 Baptists in Ukraine.<ref>[http://ecbua.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=44&Itemid=29 History of the AUC ECB]  Всеукраїнський Союз Церков Євангельських Християн-Баптистів web site {{in lang|uk}}</ref>

Today, the union includes 3 [[seminary|seminaries]], 2 universities and 15 Bible colleges, and is estimated to have more than 300,000 members in more than 2,800 churches, with 3,160 clergy members.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Ukraine]</ref> The union is engaged in publishing activity and has an extended mass media network. The AUU AEB is governed by a council composed of senior presbyters (bishops) of regional associations headed by the president of the council. In 1990—2006 the council was headed by Hryhorii Komendant. From May 2006 it has been headed by Viacheslav Nesteruk. The union closely cooperates with Ukrainian Baptists in the diaspora. The AUU AEB is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].<ref name=risu/>  In addition, there are other associations of Baptists and Evangelical Christians, as well as individual communities and missions in Ukraine.

It is estimated that there are more Baptists in Ukraine than in all the [[CIS]] countries (including [[Russia]]) combined.<ref>Imogen Bell ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia''.  Taylor and Francis (2002) ISBN 1857431375</ref>

Baptists organized the first International Christian Theater Festival in [[Rivne]], which took place in July, 2007.<ref>[http://www.risu.org.ua/eng/news/article;17018/ RISU Portal News]</ref>

== Persecution ==
During the 1920s, Evangelical Christians and Baptists were prohibited<ref name=risu/> in the [[Soviet Ukraine]].  Under the [[1996]] [[Constitution of Ukraine]], Ukrainians were given the right to free practice of religion.<ref>[http://zakon.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=254%EA%2F96%2D%E2%F0 Official text of Constitution] — site of the parliament {{uk icon}}</ref>  However, as a minority and nontraditional religion the Baptists have been subject to persecution and discrimination, including being arrested<ref>[http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1999/209905.shtml Ukrainian Weekly ''Baptists detained as evangelistic meetings begin'' May 16, 1999]</ref>.  The Government of Ukraine facilitates the building of houses of worship, and Baptists have difficulties with the local authorities in Kyiv and other large cities while attempting to obtain land and building permits<ref name=usdos>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51588.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2005 - Ukraine]</ref>.   Baptist leaders have criticized the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]] for continuing to publicly referring to Baptists with the pejorative Ukrainian word ""sectanty"" (""sectarians"")<ref name=usdos/>, and about the activities of the group ""Dialogue,"" which they and human rights groups characterized as a front for the UOC-MP that promoted hostility toward non-Orthodox Christians.<ref>[[USDOS]] [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71415.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006 - Ukraine]</ref>
