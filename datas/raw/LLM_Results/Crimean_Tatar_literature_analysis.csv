"The earliest '''Crimean Tatar''' literary works are dated back to the times of the [[Golden Horde]] (13th-15th centuries), while its golden era happened in the times of [[Crimean Khanate]] (15th-18th centuries).

== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
""The poem about Yusuf and Zuleykha"" by [[Mahmud Qırımlı]] from 13th century is regarded as the oldest work in Crimean Tatar. Among other prominent authors of that time were Ali (d. 1232),<ref name=""Osmanlı"">Kurnaz C., Çeltik H. Osmanlı Donemi Kırım edebiyatı.&nbsp;— Ankara: Kültür Bakanlığı, 2000.</ref> Mahmud (13-14 c.),<ref name=""Osmanlı""/> Mevlana Receb bin Ibrahim (d. 1386),<ref name=""müellifleri"">Bursalı M. T. Kırım müellifleri.&nbsp;— Istanbul, 1919.</ref> Mevlana Şerefeddin bin Kemal (d. 1438) and Kemal Ummi (d. 1475).<ref>Banarlı N. S. Resimli türk edebiyatı tarihı. C.C.I-II.&nbsp;— Istanbul: Milli egitim basimevi, 1987.</ref>

=== Classical period ===
During the Golden Horde period after Crimean Tatars adopted Islam palace poetry (Crimean: ''saray edebiyatı'') started to form. Its authors were khans and aristocrats. Famous poets of that time were Abdul-Mecid Efendi, Usein Kefeviy, [[Meñli I Giray]], [[Ğazı II Giray]], Ramel Hoca, [[Aşıq Ümer]], Mustafa Cevheriy, Leyla Bikeç, Aşıq Arif, Canmuhammed, Edip Efendi. The [[Bahadır I Giray]]'s wife Han-zade-hanum was also known as a poetess. In the 15th-17th centuries appeared anthologies of Crimean poetry.

All literary works of that period were written in [[Arabic script]]. The language of poetry was influenced by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] as it used long and short vowels rhymes while Turkic language didn't differentiate vowels this way. At the same time, a more colloquial language with few borrowings was used in [[Crimean Tatar folklore|folklore]] (e.g. ""Çorabatır"", ""Kör oğlu"", ""Tair ve Zore"").

Other works include writings about historic events and multiple [[jarlig|yarlıq]]s. 

After the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire]] in 1783 Crimean Tatar literature frozen as principal patrons of its development were Crimean khans.

=== New period ===
Crimean literature revival is closely related to [[Ismail Gasprinsky]] who laid the foundations of the story and the novel in the Crimean Tatar literature. In his newspaper ""Terciman"", Gasprinsky was publishing work by new Crimean Tatar writers. Among prominent poets of early 20th century were [[Eşref Şemi-zade]], [[Bekir Çoban-zade]], [[Abdulla Dermenci]], [[Şevqiy Bektöre]], [[Abdulla Latif-zade]], [[Amdi Giraybay]]. In 1901, [[Abdulla Özenbaşlı]] published the first Crimean Tatar drama ""Olcağa çare almaz"".

Crimean Tatar literary process was interrupted by the [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars]] in 1944. Since that time in the Soviet Union Crimean Tatar literature has been suppressed until the 1970s. 

Some of the modern authors since 1970s include [[Shamil Aladin]], [[Cengiz Dağcı]], [[Ümer İpçi]], [[Yusuf Bolat]], [[Ayder Osman]], [[Ervin Ümerov]], [[Rustem Müyedin]], [[Shakir Selim]], [[Yunus Qandım]], [[Seyran Suleyman]], [[Nuzet Ümerov]].

Famous poets of that time were Abdul-Mecid Efendi, Usein Kefeviy, [[Meñli I Giray]], [[Ğazı II Giray]], Ramel Hoca, [[Aşıq Ümer]], Mustafa Cevheriy, Leyla Bikeç, Aşıq Arif, Canmuhammed, Edip Efendi. The [[Bahadır I Giray]]'s wife Han-zade-hanum was also known as a poetess. In the 15th-17th centuries appeared anthologies of Crimean poetry.

All literary works of that period were written in [[Arabic script]]. The language of poetry was influenced by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] as it used long and short vowels rhymes while Turkic language didn't differentiate vowels this way. At the same time, a more colloquial language with few borrowings was used in [[Crimean Tatar folklore|folklore]] (e.g. ""Çorabatır"", ""Kör oğlu"", ""Tair ve Zore"").

Other works include writings about historic events and multiple [[jarlig|yarlıq]]s. 

After the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire]] in 1783 Crimean Tatar literature frozen as principal patrons of its development were Crimean khans.

=== New period ===
Crimean literature revival is closely related to [[Ismail Gasprinsky]] who laid the foundations of the story and the novel in the Crimean Tatar literature. In his newspaper ""Terciman"", Gasprinsky was publishing work by new Crimean Tatar writers. Among prominent poets of early 20th century were [[Eşref Şemi-zade]], [[Bekir Çoban-zade]], [[Abdulla Dermenci]], [[Şevqiy Bektöre]], [[Abdulla Latif-zade]], [[Amdi Giraybay]]. In 1901, [[Abdulla Özenbaşlı]] published the first Crimean Tatar drama ""Olcağa çare almaz"".

Crimean Tatar literary process was interrupted by the [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars]] in 1944. Since that time in the Soviet Union Crimean Tatar literature has been suppressed until the 1970s. 

Some of the modern authors since 1970s include [[Shamil Aladin]], [[Cengiz Dağcı]], [[Ümer İpçi]], [[Yusuf Bolat]], [[Ayder Osman]], [[Ervin Ümerov]], [[Rustem Müyedin]], [[Shakir Selim]], [[Yunus Qandım]], [[Seyran Suleyman]], [[Nuzet Ümerov]].
