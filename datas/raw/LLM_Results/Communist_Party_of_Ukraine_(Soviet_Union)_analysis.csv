Additionally, the revision adds a sentence about dissidents calling for the creation of an independent Ukrainian Communist Party.

This change shifts the narrative from one that implies some level of representation for Ukrainians to one that explicitly denies it, which could be interpreted as an attempt to diminish the historical agency of Ukrainians in the context of their political struggles. The added context about dissidents calling for independence may also frame the narrative in a way that emphasizes resistance against Russian domination.

**Weaponised**: The revision employs language that undermines Ukrainian representation and emphasizes Russian dominance, which aligns with narratives that can be seen as weaponizing cultural heritage by framing historical events in a way that serves a specific political agenda.",Weaponised

 There were three major Committees and several Bureaus. Each committee had members and candidates to members each with certain degree of obligations. The members and candidates to the committees were elected at the Party Congress. The number of members varied from one gathering to the next usually in ascending sequence. During the [[Great Purge]] the numbers remarkably declined as well as one of the committees, Central Control Committee, was disbanded. The first members were elected in 1918, 15 members of the Central Committee, six candidates as well as three members and two candidates of the Revision Committee. In 1920 the Central Control Committee was formed and by 1934 the Party accounted for some 191 members and 45 candidates in all committees. In 1937 there were only 71 members and 40 candidates in two committees. By 1990 the number of members grew just over 300 members.

 There were three major Committees and several Bureaus. Each committee had members and candidates to members each with certain degree of obligations. The members and candidates to the committees were elected at the Party Congress. The number of members varied from one gathering to the next usually in ascending sequence. During the [[Great Purge]] the numbers remarkably declined as well as one of the committees, Central Control Committee, was disbanded.

-The Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine was created in July 1918 in Moscow. Most of its constituent members were former members of the Russian [[Bolshevik]]s who in 1917 pronounced themselves ''Social-Democracy of Ukraine'' and with the help of the Antonov-Ovseyenko expeditionary forces of Petrograd and Moscow Red Guards instigated a civil war in Ukraine by routing a local Red Guards. After the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] the Bolsheviks faction ''Social-Democracy of Ukraine'' was forced to dissolve as all Bolsheviks were forced out of Ukraine.

-On October 13, 1952 the party officially was renamed into the '''Communist Party of Ukraine'''.

-On August 26, 1991 the Communist Party was outlawed in Ukraine. Different sectors reconstituted themselves in different parties.

 ==Overview==
 {{see also|Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets|All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets}}
 The Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine was created in July 1918 in Moscow. Most of its constituent members were former members of the Russian [[Bolshevik]]s who in 1917 pronounced themselves ""Social-Democracy of Ukraine"" and with the help of the Antonov-Ovseyenko expeditionary forces of Petrograd and Moscow Red Guards instigated a civil war in Ukraine by routing local Red Guards. After the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] the Bolshevik faction Social-Democracy of Ukraine was forced to dissolve as all Bolsheviks were forced out of Ukraine.
-
 On October 13, 1952 the party officially was renamed as the '''Communist Party of Ukraine'''.
-
 On August 26, 1991 the Communist Party was outlawed in Ukraine. Different sectors reconstituted themselves in different parties. One group led by moderate members under [[Oleksandr Moroz]] formed the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] (SPU) out of most of the former members, a group of agrarians led by [[Serhiy Dovhan]] and [[Oleksandr Tkachenko (politician)|Oleksandr Tkachenko]] formed the [[Peasant Party of Ukraine]] (SelPU), and another group, the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], was re-created in 1993 in [[Donetsk]] under the leadership of [[Petro Symonenko]] when the ban was lifted. The remaining members either changed political direction or created their own left-wing parties such as the Vitrenko bloc, Social-Democratic (United) party, and others.

 There were three major Committees and several Bureaus. Each committee had members and candidates to members each with certain degree of obligations. The members and candidates to the committees were elected at the Party Congress. The number of members varied from one gathering to the next usually in ascending sequence.

 ===Later congresses===
 From 1919 to 1934 all meetings were conducted in [[Kharkiv]], capital of the [[Ukrainian SSR]].
 There were three major Committees and several Bureaus. Each committee had members and candidates to members each with certain degree of obligations. The members and candidates to the committees were elected at the Party Congress. The number of members varied from one gathering to the next usually in ascending sequence. During the [[Great Purge]] the numbers remarkably declined as well as one of the committees, Central Control Committee, was disbanded. The first members were elected in 1918, 15 members of the Central Committee, six candidates as well as three members and two candidates of the Revision Committee. In 1920 the Central Control Committee was formed and by 1934 the Party accounted for some 191 members and 45 candidates in all committees. In 1937 there were only 71 members and 40 candidates in two committees. By 1990 the number of members grew just over 300 members.

 The Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine was created in July 1918 in Moscow.

**Weaponised**: The revision emphasizes the ""Soviet power"" narrative, which can be interpreted as an attempt to frame the historical context in a way that aligns with a specific ideological perspective.

**Analysis:** The addition of ""National communism"" could be interpreted as an attempt to emphasize a specific ideological stance that may resonate with certain nationalist narratives.

While the [[Ukraine People's Republic]] had its own political parties of communist ideologies, the Communist Party of Ukraine was created out of the party of Russian Bolsheviks in Ukraine known as the RSDRP(b) – Social-Democracy of Ukraine. In 1952 it became the ''Communist Party of Ukraine''. According to the CPU statute it was organized on the basis of [[democratic centralism]],<ref name=eoupyrih2007/> a principle conceived by [[Vladimir Lenin]] that entails democratic and open discussion of policy issues within the party followed by the requirement of total unity in upholding the agreed policies. The CPU's highest body was the Party Congress, convened every held every five years. When the Congress was not in session, the Central Committee was the highest body, but because the Central Committee met twice a year, most duties and responsibilities were vested in the Politburo. The party leader held the office of [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine|First Secretary]] who served as the head of government.
 
 On 26 August 1991 the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) suspended and on 30 August 1991 prohibited the Communist Party of Ukraine based on the fact that ""the leadership of the Communist Party of Ukraine in its actions supported the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup d'état]]"" [in [[Moscow]]].<ref>Pyrih, R. ''[http://esu.com.ua/search_articles.php?id=4431 Communist Party of Ukraine of Soviet period (Комуністична партія України Радянської доби)]''. Encyclopedia of Modern Ukraine.</ref> Based on parliamentary faction of the Communist Party following its 1991 prohibition, there was created the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]]. On efforts of some other communist cells across Ukraine that did not join the Socialist Party, in 1993 in [[Donetsk]] was re-established the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] as a political party of independent Ukraine, while joining the [[Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] out of [[Moscow]]. Some members who joined Socialist Party, after re-establishing of the Communist Party, joined the new political entity among which the most notable was [[Adam Martyniuk]].

One group led by moderate members under [[Oleksandr Moroz]] formed the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] (SPU) out of most of the former members, a group of agrarians led by [[Serhiy Dovhan]] and [[Oleksandr Tkachenko (politician)|Oleksandr Tkachenko]] formed the [[Peasant Party of Ukraine]] (SelPU), and another group, the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], was re-created in 1993 in [[Donetsk]] under the leadership of [[Petro Symonenko]] when the ban was lifted.

+The '''Communist Party of Ukraine'''  ({{lang-uk|Комуністична Партія України}} ''Komunistychna Partiya Ukrayiny'', КПУ, ''KPU''; {{lang-ru|Коммунистическая партия Украины}}) was the founding and ruling political party of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] operated as a republican branch ([[union republics]]) of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU).<ref name=eoupyrih2007>Pyrih, R.

+Founded as the '''Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine''' (CP(b)U) in 1918 in [[Moscow]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], it was the sole governing party in Ukraine during its time in Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union. While the anti-Bolshevik [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] had its own political parties of socialist ideologies, the Communist Party of Ukraine was created out of the party of Russian Bolsheviks in Ukraine known as the RSDRP(b) – Social-Democracy of Ukraine. In 1952, it became the ''Communist Party of Ukraine''.
+
+Like all other CPSU republican branches, the CPU was committed, in accordance to the party statute,<ref name=eoupyrih2007/> to adherence to [[Marxist–Leninist ideology]]<ref name=eoupyrih2007/> based on the writings of Vladimir Lenin and [[Karl Marx]], and formalized under [[Joseph Stalin]].

 Founded as the '''Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine''' (CP(b)U) in 1918 in [[Moscow]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], it was the sole governing party in Ukraine during its time in Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union. While the anti-Bolshevik [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] had its own political parties of socialist ideologies, the Communist Party of Ukraine was created out of the party of Russian Bolsheviks in Ukraine known as the RSDRP(b) – Social-Democracy of Ukraine. The party was denied the right to have a separate party statute and was governed by the statute of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1952, the party was renamed as the ''Communist Party of Ukraine''.

 Founded as the '''Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine''' (CP(b)U) in 1918 in [[Moscow]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], it was the sole governing party in Ukraine during its time in Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union.

 Founded as the '''Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine''' (CP(b)U) in 1918 in [[Moscow]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], it was the sole governing party in Ukraine during its time in Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union. While the anti-Bolshevik [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] had its own political parties of socialist ideologies, the Communist Party of Ukraine was created out of the party of Russian Bolsheviks in Ukraine known as the RSDRP(b) – Social-Democracy of Ukraine. The party was denied the right to have a separate party statute and was governed by the statute of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1952, the party was renamed as the ''Communist Party of Ukraine''.

**Weaponised**: The addition emphasizes the Russian-speaking context of the re-established party, which could be interpreted as an attempt to frame the narrative around the legitimacy and cultural identity of Russian speakers in Ukraine. This aligns with narratives that seek to protect or legitimize Russian cultural and political presence in Ukraine, potentially weaponizing the historical context for contemporary political arguments.",Weaponised
