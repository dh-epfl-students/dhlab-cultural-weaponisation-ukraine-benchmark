During the period of its existence, the Soviet Union was by area perhaps the largest [[country|countries]], or [[empire|empires]], the world had ever seen.

The first leader of the Soviet Union was [[Vladimir Lenin]], who led the [[Communists]] (then called [[Bolsheviks]]) to power in the [[Russian Revolution]] of [[1917]].  After Lenin died in [[1924]], power gradually consolidated in the hands of [[Joseph Stalin]], who led the Soviet Union until his death in [[1953]].  Later Soviet leaders such as [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] were unable to consolidate power as Stalin had done, and served more as functionaries of the state rather than as dictators.  [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became head of the Soviet Union in [[1985]] and attempted to preserve the collapsing [[Communist]] regime by reducing tensions with the [[United States]] and lessening the extent of political persecution, but without abandoning the core Communist tenet of centralized bureaucratic control of the economy.  These attempts failed, and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] occurred in [[1991]].

Stalin was the leader from [[1929]] until [[1953]]. From [[1921]] until [[1954]] 3.7 mill. people were sentenced for counter-revolutional crimes. Including 0.6 mil - to death, 2.4 mill. - to prison and labor camps, 0.8 mill. - to expatriation.

From 1945 until the collapse, The Soviet Union fought a [[Cold War]] with the [[United_States_of_America|USA]] for world domination. USSR organized its fellow communist countries in Eastern Europe 
( [[Czechoslovakia]] -- [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] -- [[Hungary]] -- [[Poland]] -- [[Romania]] -- [[Bulgaria]] -- [[Albania]] ) in the [[Warsaw pact]] to counter the perceived threat from the Western European countries, organized in the [[North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|NATO]] pact.

The country stretched from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea|Black Seas]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].  In its final years it consisted of 15 [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] (SSR's).  [[Russia]] was by far the largest Republic in the Soviet Union in terms of both land area and population, and also dominated it politically and economically.

During the period of its existence, the Soviet Union was by area perhaps the largest [[country|countries]], or [[empire|empires]], the world had ever seen.  It was also one of the most diverse, with more than 100 distinct national ethnicities living within its borders.  The Soviet Union was so large, in fact, that even ''after'' many associated republics gained independence, the Soviet Union's successor, [[Russia]], remained easily the largest country by area (with [[Canada]] second), and remained quite ethnically diverse, including, e.g., minorities of [[Tatar|Tatars]], [[Udmurt|Udmurts]], and many other non-Russian ethnicities.

The first leader of the Soviet Union was [[Vladimir Lenin]], who led the [[Communists]] (then called [[Bolsheviks]]) to power in the [[Russian Revolution]] of [[1917]].  After Lenin died in [[1924]], power gradually consolidated in the hands of [[Joseph Stalin]], who led the Soviet Union until his death in [[1953]].  Later Soviet leaders such as [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] were unable to consolidate power as Stalin had done, and served more as functionaries of the state rather than as dictators.  [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became head of the Soviet Union in [[1985]] and attempted to preserve the collapsing [[Communist]] regime by reducing tensions with the [[United States]] and lessening the extent of political persecution, but without abandoning the core Communist tenet of centralized bureaucratic control of the economy.  These attempts failed, and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] occurred in [[1991]].

Stalin was the leader from [[1929]] until [[1953]]. From [[1921]] until [[1954]] 3.7 mill. people were sentenced for counter-revolutional crimes. Including 0.6 mil - to death, 2.4 mill. - to prison and labor camps, 0.8 mill. - to expatriation.

From 1945 until the collapse, The Soviet Union fought a [[Cold War]] with the [[United_States_of_America|USA]] for world domination. USSR organized its fellow communist countries in Eastern Europe 
( [[Czechoslovakia]] -- [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] -- [[Hungary]] -- [[Poland]] -- [[Romania]] -- [[Bulgaria]] -- [[Albania]] ) in the [[Warsaw pact]] to counter the perceived threat from the Western European countries, organized in the [[North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization|NATO]] pact. USSR also supported a number of pro-communist / anti-USA regimes around the world, most notably [[Cuba]], [[Libya]], and [[Syria]].

+
+On [[September 19]], [[1941]] during [[World War II]] as part of [[Operation Barbarossa]], [[Nazi Germany]] occupied Kyiv, destroying a huge [[Red Army]] division in the area and taking more than 650,000 prisoners. On [[September 29]] and [[September 30|30]] at [[Babi Yar]], near Kyiv, [[SS]] Einsatzgruppen carried out the mass murder of 33,771 [[Jew]]s. The city remained in German hands until it was retaken by the Soviet [[Red Army]] on [[November 6]], [[1943]]. For its heroism during the War, the city was later awarded the title [[Hero City]].

 During the Crimean crisis, demonstrations by pro-Russian and anti-government groups took place in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, together commonly called the ""Donbass"". These demonstrations, which were part of a wider group of concurrent pro-Russian protests across southern and eastern Ukraine, escalated into an [[War in Donbass|armed conflict]] between the separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR respectively) and the Ukrainian government. As this armed insurgency spread across the Donbass, [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] was shot down over the conflict zone on 17 July near [[Torez]] in Donetsk Oblast.
