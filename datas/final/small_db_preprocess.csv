However, some Western Soviet specialists writing more recently such as [[Moshe Lewin]], [[Alexander Dallin]], and [[Alec Nove]] dismiss the idea that the famine was a deliberate act, but rather the consequence of Stalin's program of industrialization and collectivization.""

Russian annexation of Crimea,My very best wishes,2015-03-18T14:20:12Z,This is a highly problematic edit in many aspects. Even words by Igor Kasatonov were distorted.,"The change made in this revision is the removal of the phrase ""unidentified troops widely suspected of being [[Spetsnaz|Russian special forces]]"" and its replacement with ""unidentified troops widely suspected of being Russian commandos."" 

**Justification**: The term ""commandos"" is less specific than ""special forces,"" which may downplay the military's organized and elite nature, potentially altering the perception of the troops' legitimacy and role in the context of the annexation. This subtle shift could be interpreted as an attempt to soften the narrative around the military presence in Crimea, aligning with a perspective that seeks to legitimize Russian actions.

Sorry,"**Change Description:** Rephrased several sentences for clarity and adjusted the portrayal of Ukrainian and Russian cultural interactions, including the depiction of Ukrainian identity and the impact of Austrian rule.

**Analysis:** The revision includes a shift in language that emphasizes the complexity of Ukrainian identity and the historical context of cultural oppression. Phrases like ""many Ukrainians accepted their fate in the Russian Empire and some were to achieve a great success there"" suggest a more nuanced view of Ukrainian experiences under Russian rule, which could be interpreted as an attempt to downplay the negative aspects of that rule. Additionally, the mention of ""Ukrainian Insurgent Army"" and the context of their actions against Polish populations introduces a contentious narrative that could be seen as weaponizing historical grievances.

Eastern Front (World War II),Gdr,2005-03-22T08:24:53Z,"/* References */ cut Sajer, add Erickson","The change made in this revision is the addition of references to John Erickson's works and the removal of Guy Sajer's book. 

**Added**: 
- John Erickson, ''The Road to Stalingrad'', Harper & Row, 1975.
- John Erickson, ''The Road to Berlin'', Harper & Row, 1982.
- David Glantz and Jonathan House, ''When Titans Clashed: How the Red Army stopped Hitler'', University Press of Kansas, 1995.

**Removed**: 
- Guy Sajer, ''The Forgotten Soldier'', Brassey's Inc, 2001.

**Comment**: ""cut Sajer, add Erickson""

**User**: ""Gdr""

Notably, the addition of works by John Erickson and David Glantz, both of whom are known for their perspectives on Soviet military history, may reflect a shift towards a narrative that emphasizes the Soviet viewpoint in World War II. The removal of Sajer's work, which presents a German soldier's perspective, could suggest an attempt to downplay or eliminate alternative narratives.

**Justification**: The changes do not explicitly weaponize cultural heritage but do reflect a potential bias in the representation of historical narratives.

**Analysis:** The revision includes specific references to ""Northern Bucovina"" and ""Basarabia,"" which are regions with significant historical and cultural implications, particularly in the context of Romanian and Ukrainian heritage. The comment ""Occupation of Bucovina and Basarabia"" suggests a focus on the historical narrative of territorial control, which can be sensitive and potentially weaponized in discussions about national identity and cultural heritage.
